## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35160.5, districts maintaining grades 7-12 are mandated to adopt policy establishing eligibility requirements for student participation in extracurricular activities. See section on "Eligibility Requirements" below. 
The Governing Board recognizes that extracurricular and cocurricular activities enrich the educational and social development of students and enhance students' feelings of connectedness with the schools. The district shall encourage and support student participation in extracurricular and cocurricular activities without compromising the integrity and purpose of the educational program.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to various provisions of state and federal law (e.g., Education Code 220; Government Code 11135; 20 USC 1681-1688; 42 USC 2000d-2000d-7 and 12101-12213; 29 USC 794), discrimination in education programs and activities is unlawful when it is based on certain actual or perceived characteristics of an individual. See BP 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities. 
Prerequisites for student participation in extracurricular and cocurricular activities shall be limited to those that have been demonstrated to be essential to the success of the activity. No extracurricular or cocurricular program or activity shall be provided or conducted separately on the basis of any actual or perceived characteristic listed as a prohibited category of discrimination in state or federal law, nor shall any student's participation in an extracurricular or cocurricular activity be required or refused on those bases.  (5 CCR 4925)

Any complaint alleging unlawful discrimination in the district's extracurricular or cocurricular programs or activities shall be filed in accordance with BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49011, a district is prohibited from requiring students to pay a fee, deposit, or other charge in order to participate in an educational activity. As defined by Education Code 49010, "educational activity" includes curricular and extracurricular activities. A district is also required to provide the supplies, materials, and equipment needed by students to participate in educational activities. Education Code 49011 clarifies that an otherwise impermissible fee would not be made permissible by the provision of a waiver for some students. For further information, see BP/AR 3260 - Fees and Charges. Districts are advised to seek legal counsel before charging fees for any activity which may be construed as related to the educational program. 
Unless specifically authorized by law, no student shall be charged a fee for his/her participation in educational activities, including extracurricular and cocurricular activities and materials or equipment related to such activities. (Education Code 49010, 49011)

Eligibility Requirements

CSBA NOTE: If the district maintains any of grades 7-12, Education Code 35160.5 mandates the Governing Board to adopt policy establishing eligibility requirements for student participation in extracurricular and cocurricular activities. Pursuant to Education Code 35160.5, students must demonstrate "satisfactory educational progress," as provided in items #1-2 below, but districts may adopt stricter academic eligibility criteria provided such action is taken at a public meeting in accordance with Education Code 35145. Districts that have adopted stricter criteria should modify the following list accordingly. For interscholastic athletic programs governed by the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF), student athletes are subject to additional eligibility criteria specified in CIF bylaws, including criteria related to age, grade, attendance, scholastic achievement, residence, transfers, and discipline. See BP 6145.2 - Athletic Competition. 
To be eligible to participate in extracurricular and cocurricular activities, students in grades 7-12 must demonstrate satisfactory educational progress in the previous grading period, including, but not limited to:  (Education Code 35160.5)

	Maintenance of a minimum of 2.0 grade point average on a 4.0 scale in all enrolled classes
	 
	Maintenance of minimum progress toward meeting high school graduation requirements

The Superintendent or designee may grant ineligible students a probationary period not to exceed one semester. Students granted probationary eligibility must meet the required standards by the end of the probationary period in order to remain eligible for participation. (Education Code 35160.5)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48850 specifies that a homeless student, or a foster youth whose residence changes pursuant to a court order or decision of a child welfare worker, shall be immediately deemed to meet all residency requirements for participation in extracurricular activities, including, but not limited to, interscholastic sports. See AR 6173 - Education for Homeless Children and AR 6173.1 - Education for Foster Youth. In addition, Education Code 49700-49701 establish a uniform means of assisting children of active duty military families transferred from one state to another, by reducing or eliminating the barriers to their educational success caused by the frequent moves and deployments of their parents/guardians. Among other things, Education Code 49701 requires flexibility of districts' local rules to facilitate eligibility for extracurricular activities. See BP/AR 6173.2 - Education of Children of Military Families. 
Any decision regarding the eligibility of a homeless student, foster youth, or child of an active duty military family for extracurricular or cocurricular activities shall be made by the Superintendent or designee in accordance with Education Code 48850 and 49701.

The Superintendent or designee may revoke a student's eligibility for participation in extracurricular and cocurricular activities when the student's poor citizenship is serious enough to warrant loss of this privilege.

Student Conduct at Extracurricular/Cocurricular Events

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Pursuant to Education Code 35181, the Board has authority to set expectations and/or rules for student attendance, academic performance, in-school behavior, and any other aspect of school life that it deems relevant to maintaining order in district schools. 
When attending or participating in extracurricular and cocurricular activities on or off campus, district students are subject to district policies and regulations relating to student conduct. Students who violate district policies and regulations may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, suspension, expulsion, transfer to alternative programs, or denial of participation in extracurricular or cocurricular activities in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation. When appropriate, the Superintendent or designee shall notify local law enforcement.

Annual Policy Review

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35160.5 requires annual review of this policy, as it relates to the participation of students in grades 7-12 in extracurricular and cocurricular activities. The following paragraph is optional for districts without any of grades 7-12. 
The Board shall annually review this policy and implementing regulations. (Education Code 35160.5)
