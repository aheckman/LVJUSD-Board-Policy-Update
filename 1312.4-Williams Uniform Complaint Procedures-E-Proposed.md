Specific issue(s) of the complaint:  (Please check all that apply. A complaint may contain more than one allegation.)


	Textbooks and instructional materials:  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4681)
	 
	
		A student, including an English learner, does not have standards-aligned textbooks or instructional materials or state- or District-adopted textbooks or other required instructional materials to use in class
		 
		A student does not have access to textbooks or instructional materials to use at home or after school
		
		This does not require two sets of textbooks or instructional materials for each student
		 
		Textbooks or instructional materials are in poor or unusable condition, have missing pages, or are unreadable due to damage
		 
		A student was provided photocopied sheets from only a portion of a textbook or instructional materials to address a shortage of textbooks or instructional materials
		 
	
	
	Teacher vacancy or misassignment:  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4682)
	 
	
		A semester begins and a teacher vacancy exists
		
		A teacher vacancy is a position to which a single designated certificated employee has not been assigned at the beginning of the school year for an entire year or, if the position is for a one-semester course, a position to which a single designated certificated employee has not been assigned at the beginning of a semester for an entire semester.  (5 CCR 4600)
		 
		A teacher who lacks credentials or training to teach English learners is assigned to teach a class with one or more English learners in the class
		
		This does not relieve the District from complying with state or federal law regarding teachers of English Learners.
		 
		A teacher is assigned to teach a class for which the teacher lacks subject matter competency
		 
	
	
	Facilities conditions:  (Education Code 17592.72, 35186, 35292.5, 35292.6; 5 CCR 4683)
	 
	
		A condition exists that poses an emergency or urgent threat to the health or safety of students or staff while at school including gas leaks; nonfunctioning heating, ventilation, fire sprinklers, or air-conditioning systems; electrical power failure; major sewer line stoppage; major pest or vermin infestation; broken windows or exterior doors or gates that will not lock and that pose a security risk; abatement of hazardous materials previously undiscovered that pose an immediate threat to students or staff; structural damage creating a hazardous or uninhabitable condition; and any other condition deemed appropriate by the District
		 
		A school restroom has not been cleaned or maintained regularly, is not fully operational, or has not been stocked at all times with toilet paper, soap, and paper towels or functional hand dryers
		 
		For a school serving students in any of grades 3-12, the school has not, at all times, stocked and made available and accessible free of cost, an adequate supply of menstrual products in every women's and all-gender restroom, and in at least one men's restroom
		 
		Starting July 1, 2026, for a school that has more than one female and more than one male restroom designated exclusively for student use, the school has not maintained at least one all-gender restroom for student use in accordance with Education Code 35292.5
		 
		The school has not kept all restrooms open during school hours when students are not in classes and has not kept a sufficient number of restrooms open during school hours when students are in classes
		
		This does not apply when temporary closing of the restroom is necessary for a documented student safety concern, an immediate threat to student safety, or to repair the facility.
	
	

 Please describe the issue of your complaint in detail. You may attach additional pages and include as much text as you wish to fully describe the situation. For complaints regarding facilities conditions, please describe the emergency or urgent facilities condition and how that condition poses a threat to the health or safety of students or staff.
