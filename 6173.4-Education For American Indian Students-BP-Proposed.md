## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that American Indian students may have unique cultural, language, and educational needs that may be addressed by increasing student knowledge about American Indian history, including the history and culture of local tribes, and by providing American Indian students with access to education and other services necessary for such students to meet the same challenging academic standards as other students.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide all students with culturally relevant curriculum related to local American Indian tribes and implement strategies necessary for the improvement of the academic achievement of American Indian students.

In order to discuss, gain a shared understanding of, and develop curriculum for use within the District, and to identify the extent and nature of any achievement gaps between American Indian students and other District students, and strategies to address any such gaps, the District may form a California Indian Education Task Force with tribes local to the region. Participants in the task force meetings may consider issues of mutual concern, which include:  (Education Code 33391)

	Developing a thorough, shared understanding of accurate, high-quality curricular materials about the history, culture, and government of local tribes, and developing such materials for use within the District that include tribal experiences and perspectives
	 
	Developing a shared understanding of proper or improper instructional materials when these materials use depictions of Native Americans
	 
	Encouraging the adoption of the curriculum developed by the California Indian Education Task Force
	 
	Identifying the extent and nature of any achievement gap between American Indian students and other students, and strategies necessary to close it

If formed, the California Indian Education Task Force shall, within one year and thereafter annually, submit a report to the California Department of Education on the findings, including progress of work on Items #1-4, above.  (Education Code 33391)

The Superintendent or designee shall identify American Indian students most at-risk of not meeting state academic standards and provide to such students the needed support(s), including making referrals, as appropriate, for special education services or services under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other school-based services such as counseling and health services, supplemental instruction, before- or after-school services, and summer learning programs.

Suspension, expulsion, assignment to a supervised suspension classroom, or involuntary transfer to a continuation school of an American Indian student shall be in accordance with law and as specified in Administrative Regulation 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process, 5144.2 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process (Students with Disabilities), and 6184 - Continuation Education.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide programs to facilitate the successful transition of American Indian students to post-secondary education and employment, which may include college and career fairs in accordance with Labor Code 3074.2, mentorship programs, and counseling services.

As needed, the Superintendent or designee shall provide professional development to teachers and other school staff to assist them in understanding and responding to the unique needs of American Indian students.

At least annually, the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board on the outcomes of American Indian students including, but not limited to, school attendance, student achievement test results, promotion and retention by grade level, graduation rates, and suspension/expulsion rates.

Title VI Indian Education Program

With the assistance of federal Title VI funding for the education of children from federally recognized tribes, the District shall offer programs and activities to meet the unique cultural, language, and educational needs of American Indian students, as defined in 20 USC 7491. Program objectives and outcomes shall be based on state academic standards.  (20 USC 7424)

In developing, implementing, and evaluating Title VI programs and activities, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with and involve parents/guardians and family members of American Indian students and other community representatives.  (20 USC 7424)

The District shall establish a committee that is composed of, and selected by, parents/guardians and family members of American Indian students, representatives of tribes on tribal lands located within 50 miles of any District school that serves any children of the tribes, teachers, and, if appropriate, American Indian students enrolled in secondary schools in the District. The majority of the committee shall be parents/guardians and family members of American Indian students. The committee shall participate in program development and provide written approval for the program. (20 USC 7424)

The District's Title VI program for American Indian education may include any of the following services and activities:  (20 USC 7425)

	Activities that support Native American language programs and Native American language restoration programs, which may be taught by traditional leaders
	 
	Culturally related activities that support the District's program
	 
	Early childhood and family programs that emphasize school readiness
	 
	Enrichment programs that focus on problem solving and cognitive skills development and directly support the attainment of state academic standards
	 
	Integrated educational services in combination with other programs that meet the needs of American Indian students and their families, including programs that promote parent/guardian involvement in school activities and increase student achievement
	 
	Career preparation activities that enable American Indian students to participate in career technical education programs, including programs for mentoring and apprenticeship
	 
	Activities to educate individuals so as to prevent violence, suicide, and substance abuse
	 
	The acquisition of equipment that is essential to achieve program goals
	 
	Activities that promote the incorporation of culturally responsive teaching and learning strategies into the District's educational program
	 
	Family literacy services
	 
	Activities that recognize and support the unique cultural and educational needs of American Indian students, and incorporate appropriately qualified tribal elders and seniors
	 
	Dropout prevention strategies for American Indian students
	 
	Strategies to meet the educational needs of American Indian students in correctional facilities, including such strategies that support American Indian students who are transitioning from such facilities to schools served by the District

Any federal funds received to support American Indian education programs shall be used to supplement, not supplant, state or local funds allocated for such purposes.  (20 USC 7424)

Program funds may be used to support a Title I schoolwide program pursuant to 20 USC 6314 if approved by the committee established pursuant to 20 USC 7424, provided that the schoolwide program is consistent with the purpose of American Indian education programs and the District's application identifies how the use of such funds in a schoolwide program will produce benefits to American Indian students that would not be achieved if not used in a schoolwide program.  (20 USC 7424)

As needed, professional development shall be provided to teachers and other school staff to assist them in working with American Indian students and carrying out Title VI programs.  (20 USC 7424)

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain a record of the information establishing the status of each student as an American Indian student eligible for assistance through the federal American Indian education program.  (20 USC 7427)

The Superintendent or designee shall periodically assess the progress of all American Indian students, including American Indian students who do not participate in programs funded through Title VI, in meeting program goals and objectives. Assessment results shall be provided to the Board, the committee established pursuant to 20 USC 7424, tribes whose children are served by the District, and the community.  (20 USC 7424)
