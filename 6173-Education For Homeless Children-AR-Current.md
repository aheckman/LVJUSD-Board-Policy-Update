## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation is mandated pursuant to Education Code 48851.3, as added by AB 408 (Ch. 914, Statutes of 2022) and 42 USC 11432, which require districts to establish homeless education program policies. Pursuant to Education Code 48851.3 districts are required to update these policies at least once every three years. See section on "Transportation" below for additional requirements.
Definitions

CSBA NOTE: The federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 USC 11434a) and Education Code 48859 define "homeless children and youths" as provided below. Foster youth who are living in emergency or transitional shelters are within the definition of homeless students but youth who are awaiting foster care placement are not. See BP/AR 6173.1 - Education for Foster Youth for state law regarding foster children.
Homeless students or students experiencing homelessness means students who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence and includes:  (Education Code 48859; 42 USC 11434a)


	Students who are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason; are living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations; are living in emergency or transitional shelters; or are abandoned in hospitals
	 
	Students who have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as regular sleeping accommodations for human beings
	 
	Students who are living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings
	 
	Migratory children who qualify as homeless because they are living in conditions described in items #1-3 above

Unaccompanied youth includes a homeless child or youth not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian.  (Education Code 48859; 42 USC 11434a)

CSBA NOTE: The following definition of "school of origin" generally reflects Education Code 48852.7, which exceeds the definition in 42 USC 11432 and is consistent with the state definition of "school of origin" that applies to foster youth. However, 42 USC 11432 includes preschools in the definition as provided below.
School of origin means the school that the student experiencing homelessness attended when permanently housed or the school in which the student was last enrolled, including a preschool. If the school the student experiencing homelessness attended when permanently housed is different from the school in which the student was last enrolled, or if there is some other school that the student attended within the preceding 15 months and with which the student is connected, the district liaison for homeless students, in consultation with and with the agreement of the student experiencing homelessness and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student, shall determine which school is, in the best interests of the student experiencing homelessness, deemed the school of origin.  (Education Code 48852.7; 42 USC 11432)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48850 expresses legislative intent that the "best interest" of a student experiencing homelessness or foster youth includes educational stability as well as placement in the least restrictive educational program, as provided below. Education Code 48853 further provides that the placement of a foster youth must consider the student's access to academic resources, services, and extracurricular and enrichment activities. For consistency with the definition of "best interest" applicable to foster youth see AR 6173.1 - Education for Foster Youth. The following definition also reflects Education Code 48853.
Best interest means that, in making educational and school placement decisions for a student experiencing homelessness, consideration is given to, among other factors, educational stability, the opportunity to be educated in the least restrictive educational setting necessary to achieve academic progress, and the student's access to academic resources, services, and extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to all district students.  (Education Code 48850, 48853; 42 USC 11432)

District Liaison

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 42 USC 11432, districts are required to designate an appropriate staff person, who may also be a coordinator for other federal programs, as a district liaison for homeless students. The district should fill in the blanks below with the title or position, address, email address, and phone number of the district liaison.
The Superintendent designates the following staff person as the district liaison for homeless students:  (42 USC 11432)

________________________________________________________
(title or position)
________________________________________________________
(address)
________________________________________________________
(email address)
________________________________________________________
(phone number)

CSBA NOTE: The duties of the district liaison for homeless students are listed in Education Code 48851.3, as added by AB 408, and 42 USC 11432 and are specified below. Also see the U.S. Department of Education's (USDOE), "Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program Non-Regulatory Guidance," and the "Homeless Liaison Toolkit," developed by the National Center for Homeless Education.
The district's liaison for homeless students shall:  (Education Code 48851.3, 48851.5, 48852.5; 42 USC 11432)

	Ensure that students experiencing homelessness are identified by school personnel through outreach and coordination activities with other entities and agencies
	 
	Ensure that students experiencing homelessness are enrolled in, and have a full and equal opportunity to succeed in, district schools
	 
	Ensure that families and students experiencing homelessness have access to and receive educational services for which they are eligible, including services through Head Start and Early Head Start programs, early intervention services under Part C of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and other preschool programs administered by the district
	 
	Ensure that families and students experiencing homelessness receive referrals to health care services, dental services, mental health and substance abuse services, housing services, and other appropriate services
	 
	Inform parents/guardians of the educational and related opportunities available to their children and ensure that they are provided with meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children
	 
	Disseminate public notice of the educational rights of students experiencing homelessness in locations frequented by parents/guardians of students experiencing homelessness and by unaccompanied youth, including schools, shelters, public libraries, and hunger relief agencies (soup kitchens). The rights shall be presented in a manner and form understandable to the parents/guardians of homeless students and unaccompanied youth.
	 
	Mediate enrollment disputes in accordance with law and the section "Resolving Enrollment Disputes" below
	 
	Fully inform parents/guardians of students experiencing homelessness and unaccompanied youth of all transportation services, including transportation to the school of origin, and assist them in accessing transportation to the school of choice
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48852.5, the California Department of Education (CDE) is required to provide training materials to district liaisons for homeless students for the purpose of providing required professional development and support to school personnel who provide services to homeless students.Pursuant to Education Code 48851.3, as added by AB 408, the district's liaison for homeless students is required to offer annual training to district employees who provide services to students experiencing homelessness and inform such employees of the availability of training and the services the liaison provides. While Education Code 48851.3 requires annual training for employees who work with students experiencing homelessness, the district's liaison for homeless students is encouraged to offer training to all district employees.The examples of school personnel listed below reflect CDE's 2022-23 Federal Program Monitoring Instrument.
	Offer annual training related to the district's homeless education program policies to school personnel who provide services to students experiencing homelessness, including principals and other school leaders, attendance officers, teachers, enrollment personnel, and specialized instructional support personnel, to ensure that such employees are informed of available training, professional development, and other support, and the services provided by the district liaison for homeless students
	 
	Ensure that unaccompanied youth are enrolled in school, have opportunities to meet the same challenging state academic standards established for other students, and are informed of their status as independent students under 20 USC 1087vv and that they may receive assistance from the district liaison to receive verification of their independent student status for purposes of applying for federal student aid pursuant to 20 USC 1090
	 
	Coordinate and collaborate with state coordinators and community and school personnel responsible for the provision of education and related services to students experiencing homelessness, including the collection and provision of comprehensive data to the state coordinator as required by law

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48918.1, the district liaison must be notified at least 10 calendar days before the date of the expulsion hearing for a student experiencing homelessness, when the student's alleged violation does not require a mandatory recommendation for expulsion, and may be notified for mandatory expulsions; see AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process. When so notified, the district liaison is expected to assist the student and, as necessary, advocate on the student's behalf.Furthermore, pursuant to Education Code 48915.5, if the student experiencing homelessness has also been identified as an individual with a disability and the district has proposed a change of placement due to an act for which the decision to recommend expulsion is discretionary, the district liaison must be invited to participate in the individualized education program (IEP) team meeting that makes a manifestation determination pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 USC 1415(k)).
In addition, when notified pursuant to Education Code 48918.1, the district liaison shall assist, facilitate, or represent a student experiencing homelessness who is undergoing a disciplinary proceeding that could result in the student's expulsion. When notified pursuant to Education Code 48915.5, the district liaison shall participate in an individualized education program (IEP) team meeting to make a manifestation determination regarding the behavior of a student with a disability.

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 11432 requires CDE to publish a list of district liaisons on its web site. CDE collects the name and contact information of district liaisons through the consolidated application process, along with information about district compliance with federal program requirements.
The Superintendent or designee shall inform students experiencing homelessness, their parents/guardians, school personnel, service providers, and advocates working with homeless families of the duties of the district's liaison. The Superintendent or designee shall also provide the name and contact information of the district's liaison to the California Department of Education (CDE) for publishing on CDE's web site.  (42 USC 11432)

Enrollment

The district shall make placement decisions for students experiencing homelessness based on the student's best interest.  (Education Code 48850; 42 USC 11432)

In determining a student's best interest, a student experiencing homelessness shall, to the extent feasible, be placed in the school of origin, unless the student's parent/guardian or the unaccompanied youth requests otherwise.  (Education Code 48852.7; 42 USC 11432)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48850 and 42 USC 11432 specify factors that must be considered in determining a student's best interest, as provided below.
When determining the best interest of any student experiencing homelessness, the district shall give priority to the request of the student's parent/guardian, or in the case of an unaccompanied youth, the request of the student. The student's educational stability and opportunity to be educated in the least restrictive educational setting necessary to achieve academic progress and other student-centered factors related to the student's best interest, including the impact of mobility on the student's achievement, education, health, and safety, shall also be considered.  (Education Code 48850; 42 USC 11432)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph presents examples of factors that may be considered in making placement decisions based on a student's "best interest," and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Such factors may include, but are not limited to, the age of the student, the distance of the commute and the impact it may have on the student's education, personal safety issues, the student's need for special instruction, the length of anticipated stay in the temporary shelter or other temporary location, likely area of future housing, school placement of siblings, and the time remaining in the school year.

However, placement decisions shall not be based on whether a student experiencing homelessness lives with the student's homeless parent/guardian or has been temporarily placed elsewhere.  (42 USC 11432)

In the case of an unaccompanied youth, the district liaison shall assist in placement or enrollment decisions, give priority to the views of the student, and provide notice to the student of the right to appeal.  (42 USC 11432)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48852.7 and 42 USC 11432 require schools to immediately enroll students experiencing homelessness as specified below. In USDOE's, "Non-Regulatory Guidance Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program," USDOE recommends that the district take steps to facilitate immediate enrollment such as accepting school records directly from families, establishing school-based immunization clinics, and training staff on the legal requirements for immediate enrollment. See AR 5111.1 - District Residency.
Once a placement decision has been made, the principal or designee shall immediately enroll the student in the school of choice. The student shall be enrolled even if the student:  (Education Code 48850, 48852.7; 42 USC 11432)

	Has outstanding fees, fines, textbooks, or other items or monies due to the school last attended
	 
	Does not have clothing normally required by the school, such as school uniforms
	 
	Is unable to produce records normally required for enrollment, such as previous academic records, proof of residency, and records of immunization and other required health records
	 
	Has missed application or enrollment deadlines during any period of homelessness

The principal or designee shall immediately contact the school last attended by the student to obtain the relevant records. If the student needs to obtain immunizations or does not possess immunization or other required health records, the principal or designee shall immediately refer the parent/guardian to the district liaison for homeless students. The district liaison shall assist the parent/guardian, or the student if the student is an unaccompanied youth, in obtaining the necessary immunizations, screenings, or records for the student.  (42 USC 11432)

If the student is placed at a school other than the school of origin or the school requested by the student's parent/guardian or the student, if an unaccompanied youth, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the parent/guardian or the unaccompanied youth with a written explanation of the reasons for the decision, including why placement in the student's school of origin or requested school is not in the student's best interest, along with a statement regarding the right to appeal the placement decision. The written explanation shall be in a manner and form understandable to such parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth.  (42 USC 11432)

At the point of any change or subsequent change in the residence of a student experiencing homelessness, the student may continue attending the student's school of origin for the duration of the homelessness.  (Education Code 48852.7; 42 USC 11432)

To ensure that the student experiencing homelessness has the benefit of matriculating with the student's peers in accordance with the established feeder patterns, the following shall apply:  (Education Code 48852.7; 42 USC 11432)

	If the student is transitioning between grade levels, the student shall be allowed to continue in the same attendance area
	 
	If the student is transitioning to a middle school or high school, and the school designated for matriculation is in another school district, the student shall be allowed to continue to the school designated for matriculation in that district

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48852.7 and 42 USC 11432 require that students who become permanently housed during the school year be allowed to remain in the school of origin for the remainder of the school year. Additionally, Education Code 48852.7 allows students to remain in the school of origin, or matriculate to a feeder school, even if the student is no longer experiencing homelessness. The district may revise the following list to reflect the grade levels and feeder school patterns in the district.
If the student's housing status changes before the end of the school year so that the student is no longer experiencing homelessness, the student shall be allowed to stay in the school of origin:  (Education Code 48852.7)

	Through the duration of the school year if the student is in grades K-8
	 
	Through graduation if the student is in high school

Resolving Enrollment Disputes

CSBA NOTE: In the event that a dispute arises over the district's decision related to student eligibility, school selection, or enrollment, the district must comply with the requirements of 42 USC 11432 and the dispute resolution process established by CDE. CDE's, "Homeless Education Dispute Resolution Process," available on CDE's web site, provides such guidance. CDE's guidance does not specify a hearing process or timelines for the district-level dispute resolution process. Thus, the district may revise the following section to reflect district practice, provided that the process is consistent with law.
If a dispute arises over student eligibility, school selection, or enrollment in a particular school, the matter shall be referred to the district liaison, who shall carry out the dispute resolution process as expeditiously as possible.  (42 USC 11432)

The parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth shall be provided with a written explanation of any decisions related to eligibility, school selection, or enrollment and of the right of the parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth to appeal such decisions.  (42 USC 11432)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional list should be modified to reflect district practice. In USDOE's, "Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program Non-Regulatory Guidance," USDOE recommends that the written explanation contain the elements specified below. See the accompanying exhibits for a sample explanation and appeal form.
The written explanation shall include:

	A description of the action proposed or refused by the district
	 
	An explanation of why the action is proposed or refused
	 
	A description of any other options the district considered and the reasons that any other options were rejected
	 
	A description of any other factors relevant to the district's decision and information related to the eligibility or best interest determination including the facts, witnesses, and evidence relied upon and their sources
	 
	Appropriate timelines to ensure any relevant deadlines are not missed
	 
	Contact information for the district liaison and state coordinator, and a brief description of those roles

The written explanation shall be complete, as brief as possible, simply stated, and provided in language that the parent/guardian or student can understand.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is recommended in USDOE's "Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program Non-Regulatory Guidance."
The district liaison may use an informal process as an alternative to formal dispute resolution procedures, provided that the parents/guardians or unaccompanied youth have access to the more formal process if informal resolution is not successful in resolving the matter.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is recommended in CDE's, "Homeless Education Dispute Resolution Process," guidance to districts. CDE recommends that if the parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth is an English Learner, the native language and/or an interpreter be used, and/or if additional supports are needed because of a disability, such services be made available without charge.
In working with a student's parents/guardians or unaccompanied youth to resolve an enrollment dispute, the district liaison shall:

	Inform the student's parents/guardians or unaccompanied youth that written and/or oral documentation to support their position may be provided
	 
	Inform the student's parents/guardians or unaccompanied youth that they may seek the assistance of social services, advocates, and/or service providers in having the dispute resolved
	 
	Provide a simple form that they may use and turn in to the school to initiate the dispute resolution process
	 
	Provide a copy of the dispute form they submit for their records
	 
	Provide the outcome of the dispute for their records

When a student's parent/guardian or an unaccompanied youth involved in the enrollment dispute is an English learner, Items #1-5 shall be provided either in the native language of the parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth or through an interpreter. Any additional support needed because of a disability of that parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth shall be made available without a charge.

If a parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth disagrees with the district liaison's enrollment decision, the decision may be appealed to the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall make a determination within five working days.

CSBA NOTE: In CDE's, "Homeless Education Dispute Resolution Process," CDE describes the process for appealing a district's enrollment decision to the county office of education (COE) and CDE. Upon receipt of materials describing the dispute from the district, the COE liaison will determine the school selection or enrollment decision within five working days. If the dispute remains unresolved or is appealed, the COE liaison will forward the documentation to CDE's Homeless Education Program. CDE will notify all parties of the final determination of eligibility, school selection, or enrollment within five working days of receipt of the appeal.
If the parent/guardian chooses to appeal the district's placement decision, the district liaison shall forward all written documentation and related paperwork to the liaison for homeless students at the county office of education.

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 11432 provides that, during any dispute over a student's enrollment, the student must be allowed to be enrolled in the school in which enrollment is sought during the period of all appeals. 42 USC 11434a defines "enrollment" as including attendance in classes and full participation in school activities.
Pending final resolution of the dispute, including all available appeals, the student shall be immediately enrolled in the school in which enrollment is sought and shall be allowed to attend classes and participate fully in school activities.  (42 USC 11432, 11434a)

Transportation

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 11432 mandates that districts adopt policies and practices to ensure that transportation is provided to students experiencing homelessness, at the request of the student's parent/guardian or of the district liaison in the case of an unaccompanied youth, to and from the school of origin as specified below.In USDOE's, "Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program Non-Regulatory Guidance," USDOE states that the law imposes an affirmative obligation to transport students experiencing homelessness, even if transportation is not provided to other students. The Guidance clarifies that, because the State of California receives funds under McKinney-Vento, all districts in California are subject to this requirement.
The district shall provide transportation for a student experiencing homelessness to and from the student's school of origin when the student is residing within the district and the parent/guardian, or the district liaison in the case of an unaccompanied youth, requests that such transportation be provided. If the student moves outside of district boundaries, but continues to attend the student's school of origin within this district, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the superintendent of the district in which the student is now residing to agree upon a method to apportion the responsibility and costs of the transportation.  (42 USC 11432)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 39807.5, as amended by AB 181 (Ch. 52, Statutes of 2022), the district is required to waive transportation fees for an unduplicated student, as defined in Education Code 42238.02, which includes a student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals, who is classified as an English learner, or who is a foster youth. Since it is likely that most students experiencing homelessness would be eligible to receive free meals, and would therefore qualify as an unduplicated student, such students would most likely be exempt from transportation costs. See BP 3540 Transportation and BP/AR 3250 - Transportation Fees.
Any fees that the district charges for home-to-school transportation and other transportation as expressly provided by law shall be waived for students experiencing homelessness.  (Education Code 39807.5)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48852.7 requires that the district provide transportation to a formerly homeless student with an IEP only if transportation is a necessary related service. Education Code 48852.7 does not supersede or exceed other laws governing special education services for eligible students experiencing homelessness.The following paragraph may be revised if the district chooses to provide transportation to other formerly homeless students attending their school of origin.
The district shall not be obligated to provide transportation to students who continue attending their school of origin after they secure permanent housing, unless the formerly homeless student has an IEP that includes transportation as a necessary related service for the student.  (Education Code 48852.7)

Transfer of Coursework and Credits

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts maintaining high schools. Education Code 51225.2, as amended by SB 532 (Ch. 918, Statutes of 2022), addresses the transferability of coursework and credits completed by a student experiencing homelessness, as provided below.Education Code 51225.2, as amended by SB 532, requires the transferring school to include in the student's educational record a determination of days of enrollment and/or seat time and an official transcript with full and partial credits earned, or any measure of full or partial coursework being satisfactorily completed.
When a student experiencing homelessness transfers into a district school, the district will receive an official transcript from the transferring school or district which reflects full and partial credits and grades earned by the student and includes:  (Education Code 51225.2)

	A determination of the days of enrollment and/or seat time, if applicable, for all full and partial credits earned based on any measure of full or partial coursework being satisfactorily completed
	
	Partial coursework satisfactorily completed includes any portion of an individual course, even if the student did not complete the entire course
	 
	Separate listings for credits and grades earned at each school and local educational agency so it is clear where credits and grades were earned
	 
	A complete record of the student's seat time, including both period attendance and days of enrollment

The district shall transfer the credits and grades from the transferring school's transcript onto an official district transcript in the same manner as described in Item #2, above.  (Education Code 51225.2)

If the Principal or designee has knowledge that the transcript from the transferring school may not include certain credits or grades, the Principal or designee shall contact the prior school within two business days to request that the full or partial credits be issued, which shall then be issued and provided by the prior school within two business days of the request.  (Education Code 51225.2)

The district shall accept and issue full credit for any coursework that the student has satisfactorily completed while attending another public school, a juvenile court school, a charter school, a school in a country other than the United States, or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school.  (Education Code 51225.2)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.2, districts may not require a student who has completed an entire course to retake the course.
If the entire course was completed, the district shall not require the student to retake the course.  (Education Code 51225.2)

If the entire course was not completed at the previous school, the student shall be issued partial credit for the coursework completed and shall be required to take the uncompleted portion of the course. However, the district may require the student to retake the portion of the course completed if, in consultation with the holder of educational rights for the student, the district finds that the student is reasonably able to complete the requirements in time to graduate from high school. Whenever partial credit is issued to a student in any particular course, the student shall be enrolled in the same or equivalent course, if applicable, so that the student may continue and complete the entire course.  (Education Code 51225.2)

CSBA NOTE: Although Education Code 51225.2 requires districts to award partial credits to students who transfer from school to school, there is no uniform system for calculating and awarding partial credits. A recommendation for how to award partial credit is available in the California Child Welfare Council's, "Partial Credit Model Policy and Practice Recommendations," and should be revised to reflect district practice.
Partial credits shall be awarded on the basis of 0.5 credits for every seven class periods attended per subject. If the school is on a block schedule, each block schedule class period attended shall be equal to two regular class periods per subject. Partial credits and grades earned by a student shall be included on the student's official transcript within two business days of the district's notification of the student's transfer, as required under Education Code 49069.5.

In no event shall the district prevent a student experiencing homelessness from taking or retaking a course to meet the eligibility requirements for admission to the California State University or the University of California.  (Education Code 51225.2)

Applicability of Graduation Requirements

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts maintaining high schools. Also see BP 6146.1 - High School Graduation Requirements.
To obtain a high school diploma, a student experiencing homelessness shall complete all courses required by Education Code 51225.3 and fulfill any additional graduation requirements established by the Governing Board.

However, when a student experiencing homelessness who has completed the second year of high school transfers into the district from another school district or transfers between high schools within the district, the student shall be exempted from all district-established coursework and other district-established graduation requirements, unless the district makes a finding that the student is reasonably able to complete the additional requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the fourth year of high school. Within 30 calendar days of the student's transfer, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the student, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student, and the district liaison for homeless students of the availability of the exemption and whether the student qualifies. If the Superintendent or designee fails to provide this notification, the student shall be eligible for the exemption once notified, even if the notification occurs after the student is no longer homeless.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, to determine whether a student with significant gaps in school attendance is in the third or fourth year of high school, the student's age as compared to the average age of students in the third or fourth year of high school may be used.
To determine whether a student is in the third or fourth year of high school, the district shall use either the number of credits the student has earned as of the date of the transfer, the length of school enrollment, or, for a student with significant gaps in school attendance, the student's age as compared to the average age of students in the third or fourth year of high school, whichever qualifies the student for the exemption.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, requires the district to exempt a student who qualifies for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements, under the circumstances described below.
If a student experiencing homelessness was not properly notified of an exemption, declined the exemption, or was not previously exempted, the student or the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student may request the exemption and the Superintendent or designee shall exempt the student within 30 days of the request. A student may request the exemption even if the student is no longer a student experiencing homelessness.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, the district is required to reevaluate a student's eligibility for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements, as described below.
When the Superintendent or designee determines that a student who transferred into a district school is reasonably able to complete district-established graduation requirements by the end of the student's fourth year of high school, the student shall not be exempted from those requirements. Within 30 calendar days of the following academic year, the student shall be reevaluated based on the student's course completion status at the time, to determine if the student continues to be reasonably able to complete the district-established graduation requirements in time to graduate by the end of the student's fourth year of high school. Written notice as to whether the student then qualifies for exemption shall be provided to the student, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student, and if applicable, to the student's social worker or probation officer.  (Education Code 51225.1)

If, upon reevaluation, it is determined that the student experiencing homelessness is not reasonably able to complete the district-established graduation requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the student's fourth year of high school, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the student with the option to receive an exemption from district-established graduation requirements or stay in school for a fifth year to complete the district-established graduation requirements upon agreement with the student, or if under 18 years of age, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student, and provide notifications in accordance with Education Code 51225.1.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, the district is required to consult with a student experiencing homelessness who is granted an exemption from district-established graduation requirements and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student, as described below.
When a student experiencing homelessness is exempted from district-established graduation requirements, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the student and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student about the following:  (Education Code 51225.1)

	Discussion of how any requirements that are waived may affect the student's postsecondary education or vocation plans, including the ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution
