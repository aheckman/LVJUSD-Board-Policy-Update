## Policy Content

In order to protect students while they are traveling to and from school, or attending school or a school-related activity, the Board of Education believes it is important that the District respond appropriately when a law enforcement agency notifies the District about registered sex offenders who may reside or work within District boundaries.

The Superintendent or designee shall establish an ongoing relationship with law enforcement officials to coordinate the receipt and dissemination of such information. To the extent authorized by law, the Superintendent or designee also shall establish procedures for notifying appropriate staff as necessary.

Any District employee to whom sex offender information is disclosed by a law enforcement entity shall disclose the information only when authorized by the law enforcement entity and in the manner authorized.

The Superintendent or designee may annually notify parents/guardians of the availability of information about registered sex offenders on the Department of Justice's Megan's Law website.
