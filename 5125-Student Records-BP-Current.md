## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following mandated policy and accompanying administrative regulation address  student records, which are governed by both federal and state law, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 USC 1232g, 34 CFR 99.1-99.8), the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) (20 USC 1232h), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) (15 USC 6501-6506, 16 CFR 312), Education Code 49069.7 and 49073.1, K-12 Pupil Online Personal Information Protection Act (Business and Professions Code 22584), Early Learning Personal Information Protection Act (Business and Professions Code 22586), and 5 CCR 430-438. For information regarding public access to certain records in accordance with the California Public Records Act (CPRA) (Government Code 7920.000 - 7930.215), see BP/AR 1340 - Access to District Records and BB 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications. For information regarding retention of records, see BP/AR 3580 - District Records and AR 4112.6/4212.6/4312.6 - Personnel Files.Pursuant to 5 CCR 431, districts are mandated to establish policies and procedures to implement state law and regulations regarding student records, including policies and procedures which (1) enumerate and describe the student records collected and maintained by the district, (2) ensure security of the records, and (3) guarantee access to authorized persons within five days of a request. Education Code 49069.7 mandates procedures related to parental review of student records. See the accompanying administrative regulation for additional language implementing these mandates.Pursuant to Education Code 234.7, districts were mandated to adopt policies with language that is equivalent to the model policy language developed by the California Attorney General in, "Promoting a Safe and Secure Learning Environment for All: Guidance and Model Policies to Assist California's K-12 Schools in Responding to Immigration Issues," first published in April 2018 ("2018 Guidance"), by June 1, 2018. The Attorney General updated the 2018 Guidance in December 2024 ("2024 Guidance") and has stated that districts "should" adopt or update their policies based on the 2024 Guidance by May 1, 2025. The 2024 Guidance is available on the Office of the Attorney General's website and includes model policy language regarding student records.
The Governing Board recognizes the importance of keeping accurate, comprehensive student records as required by law. The Superintendent or designee shall establish administrative regulations governing the identification, collection, retention, disclosure, and security of student records. These regulations shall ensure the rights of authorized persons to have timely access to student records while maintaining the confidentiality of student records in accordance with state and federal law.

The Superintendent or designee shall designate a certificated employee to serve as custodian of records with responsibility for student records at the district level. At each school, the principal or a certificated employee shall be designated as custodian of records for students enrolled at that school. The custodian of records shall be responsible for implementing Board policy and administrative regulation regarding student records.  (5 CCR 431)

CSBA NOTE: The privacy of online information of students in prekindergarten (preK) through grade 12 is addressed in Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World (Business and Professions Code 22580-22582), the K-12 Pupil Online Personal Information and Protection Act (Business and Professions Code 22584-22585), and the Early Learning Personal Information Protection Act (Business and Professions Code 22586-22587), which prohibit an operator of a website, online service or application, or mobile application from knowingly using, disclosing, or compiling the personal information of a minor for the purpose of marketing or advertising specified types of products or services; allowing a third party to use, disclose, or compile such information; or selling or disclosing specified student information or knowingly using such student information to engage in targeted advertising to students or parents/guardians or to amass a profile about a preK-12 student. Covered student information includes any personally identifiable information or materials created or provided by a student, parent/guardian, or district employee (e.g., name, contact information, educational record, discipline records, test results, health records, and socioeconomic information). Pursuant to Business and Professions Code 22584 and 22586, an operator is required to delete data under the control of the school or district upon the request of the school or district. However, Business and Professions Code 22584, as amended by AB 801 (Ch. 935, Statutes of 2024), does not require the deletion of student records held by a national assessment provider when the records only include standardized test results.Additionally, pursuant to Business and Professions Code 22584 and 22586, as amended by AB 801, an operator is required to delete a student's covered information that is not subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act which is under the operator's control, as specified below. Business and Professions Code 22584 and 22586, as amended by AB 801, do not require the deletion of mandatory permanent student records or any official records or files directly related to a student and maintained by the operator, school, or district.
If student records containing covered information which is not subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act are under the control of the operator of a website, online service or application, or mobile application, and the student's parent/guardian or the student, if 18 years of age or older, requests deletion of such records, the Superintendent or designee shall provide documentation to the operator that the student has not been enrolled in the district for at least 60 days.  (Business and Professions Code 22584)

All appropriate personnel shall receive training regarding district policies and procedures for gathering and handling sensitive student information, including which information should not be solicited.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49076.7, a district is prohibited from soliciting or collecting social security numbers or the last four digits of social security numbers of students or their parents/guardians, unless otherwise required to do so by state or federal law. One such exception is the collection of the last four digits of the social security number for the purpose of establishing eligibility for a federal benefit program.
The district shall not collect or solicit social security numbers or the last four digits of social security numbers of students or their parents/guardians, unless otherwise required to do so by state or federal law.  (Education Code 49076.7)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.7 prohibits the collection of information or documents regarding the citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members, as provided below. If the district becomes aware of the citizenship or immigration status of any student, it is prohibited from disclosing that information, as such disclosure is not among the limited exceptions specified in law for which student records may be released without parental consent or a lawful judicial order.The following two paragraphs are equivalent to model policy language from the 2024 Guidance.
No information or documents regarding the citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members shall be collected, except as required by state or federal law or as required to administer a state or federally supported educational program. In accordance with Board Policy 5145.13 - Response to Immigrant Enforcement, the Superintendent or designee shall not disclose student records to a person, agency, or organization for immigration enforcement purposes without parental consent, a court order, or a judicial subpoena/warrant. If a district employee receives such a request, the employee shall respond in accordance with Board Policy 5145.13 - Response to Immigrant Enforcement. The Superintendent shall report the request to the Board in a timely manner that ensures the confidentiality and privacy of any potentially identifying information.  (Education Code 234.7)

The district or any district employee shall not compile a list, registry, or database based on students' national origin, ethnicity, or religious belief, practice, or affiliation, or disclose student information to federal government authorities for the purpose of compiling such a list, registry, or database for purposes of immigration enforcement. This prohibition does not apply to information that is aggregated and is not personally identifiable.  (Government Code 8310.3)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Family Code 6323.5, districts are required to develop protocols to comply with a court's restraining order that prohibits a party from accessing records and information pertaining to the education, daycare, health care, recreational activities, or employment of a minor child of the parties, which may include prohibiting access to a parent/guardian who would otherwise be entitled to the records. The protocols must, at a minimum, (1) designate an appropriate employee(s) who is responsible for receiving protective order(s), (2) establish a means of ensuring that the restrained party is not able to access the prohibited records or information, and (3) implement a procedure for submitting a copy of the restraining order including confirmation of when and to whom it was submitted. It is recommended that districts with questions about complying with these procedures consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop protocols to comply with a court's restraining order that prohibits a party from accessing specified records and information pertaining to a student.  (Family Code 6323.5)

Student Records from Social Media

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 49073.6, any district considering a program to gather information from students' social media activity, as defined, must first notify students and parents/guardians and provide an opportunity for public comment. The notification may be provided as part of the annual parental notification required pursuant to Education Code 48980. If such a program is then adopted, the district must comply with program requirements reflected in the section "Student Records from Social Media" in the accompanying administrative regulation.It is recommended that the district consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel before gathering any other online information that does not meet the definition of social media in Education Code 49073.6.
The Superintendent or designee may gather and maintain information from the social media of any district student, provided that the district first notifies students and parents/guardians about the proposed program, offers an opportunity for public comment at a regularly scheduled Board meeting, and gathers only information that directly pertains to school safety or student safety.  (Education Code 49073.6)

Retention, Disclosure, and Security of Student Records

CSBA NOTE: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) may pose risks to keeping student records private and secure. CSBA's, "Understanding Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education: What Governance Teams Should Know," cautions districts to consider whether information about students shared with or stored in an AI-enabled system is subject to federal or state privacy laws and whether interactions between students and AI systems may create records that are required to be protected by law, such as when a chatbot or automated tutor generates written guidance to a student.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure the confidentiality of student records as required by law and shall establish processes and procedures to safeguard data against damage, loss, or theft, including damage, loss, or theft, which may be caused by the use of technology, including artificial intelligence and breaches to the district's digital infrastructure, in the retention or disclosure of student records. Additionally, in accordance with Board Policy 5145.13 - Response to Immigration Enforcement, all district staff shall avoid the disclosure of information that may indicate a student's or family's citizenship or immigration status if the disclosure is not authorized by law.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that employees receive information and training about cybersecurity, including ways to protect student records from breaches to the district's digital infrastructure.

If the district experiences a cyberattack that impacts more than 500 students or personnel, the Superintendent or designee shall report the cyberattack to the California Cybersecurity Integration Center.  (Education Code 35266)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49073.1 authorizes districts to enter into a contract with a third party for the digital storage, management, and retrieval of student records and/or for software designed for this purpose. A district that chooses to enter into such a contract is mandated to adopt policy allowing such contracts and must ensure that the contract includes all the provisions specified in Education Code 49073.1. Also see BP 3312 - Contracts.
The Superintendent or designee may enter into a contract with a third party for the digital storage, management, and retrieval of student records and/or to authorize a third party provider of digital software to access, store, and use student records, provided that the contract meets the requirements of Education Code 49073.1 and other applicable state and federal laws.
