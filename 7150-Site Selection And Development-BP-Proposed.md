## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that a school site should serve the District's educational needs in accordance with the District's master plan, as well as show potential for contributing to other community needs.

The Board recognizes the importance of community input in the site selection process.  To this end, the Board will solicit community input whenever a school site is to be selected and shall provide public notice and hold public hearings in accordance with law.

The Superintendent or designee shall establish a site selection process which complies with law and ensures that the best possible sites are acquired and developed in a cost-effective manner.

Before acquiring property for a new school or an addition to an existing school site, the Board, at a public hearing, shall either evaluate the property using state site selection standards specified in 5 CCR 14010 or, if a District advisory committee was appointed to evaluate the property, receive the committee's report of findings based on those standards.  (Education Code 17211, 17251)

Environmental Impact Investigation for the Site Selection Process

The Superintendent or designee shall determine whether any proposed development project is subject to the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and shall ensure compliance with this Act, including any web site posting requirements.  When evaluating District projects, the CEQA guidelines shall be used.

Environmental review documents, including a draft environmental impact report, environmental impact report, negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration, and public notice of the preparation and availability of such documents, shall be posted on the District's web site. (Public Resources Code 21082.1, 21092, 21092.2)

Agricultural Land

If the proposed site is in an area designated in a city, county, or city and county general plan for agricultural use and zoned for agricultural production, the Board shall determine all of the following:  (Education Code 17215.5)

	That the District has notified and consulted with the city, county, or city and county within which the prospective site is to be located
	 
	That the Board has evaluated the final site selection based on all factors affecting the public interest and not limited to selection on the basis of the cost of the land
	 
	That the District shall attempt to minimize any public health and safety issues resulting from the neighboring agricultural uses that may affect students and employees at the site
