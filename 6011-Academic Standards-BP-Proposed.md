## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that content and performance standards are necessary to clarify for students, parents/guardians and staff what students are expected to know and be able to do at each grade level and in each area of study. The Board shall adopt high standards for student achievement that meet statewide standards and challenge all students to reach their full potential. These standards shall reflect the knowledge and skills needed for students to be adequately prepared for postsecondary education, employment, and responsible citizenship.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board with recommended standards using a process that involves teachers, school site and District administrators, students, parents/guardians, representatives from business/industry and postsecondary institutions, and/or community members.  He/she shall ensure the proper articulation of standards between grade levels and the alignment of the standards with the District's vision and goals, graduation requirements, college entrance requirements, and other desired student outcomes. He/she also shall ensure that the standards are easily understandable and measurable.

District content standards for English language arts, English language development, mathematics, science, health education, history-social science, physical education, visual and performing arts, world languages, career technical education, and preschool education shall meet or exceed statewide model content standards adopted by the State Board of Education or the State Superintendent of Public Instruction as applicable.

District curriculum, instruction, student assessments, and evaluations of the instructional program shall be aligned with District content standards.  In accordance with Education Code 44662, standards of expected student achievement also shall be used in evaluating teacher performance.

Teachers and school administrators shall receive ongoing professional development to inform them of changes in the standards and to build their capacity to implement effective standards-based instructional methodologies.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually communicate the applicable standards to students and their parents/guardians to inform them of the expectations for student learning at their grade level.

Staff shall continually assess students' progress toward meeting the standards, report each student's progress to the student and his/her parents/guardians, and offer remedial assistance in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that District standards are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. At a minimum, District standards shall be reviewed whenever applicable statewide standards are revised and in response to changing student needs.
