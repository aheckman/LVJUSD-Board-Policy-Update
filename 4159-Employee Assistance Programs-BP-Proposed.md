The Board of Education recognizes that school district employees may have problems which can have detrimental effects upon job performance and student safety.  The Board encourages employees to seek help when such problems exist and to take advantage of the resources that are available to assist them.

Employees shall have confidential access to information about the District's employee assistance program.  This information shall be available to all employees and their spouses and dependents.

Management and supervisory staff shall be knowledgeable about the District's employee assistance program and may counsel employees about the program, as appropriate.

Participation in the assistance program shall not jeopardize an employee's employment or career advancement, nor will it protect the employee from disciplinary action for substandard job performance.
