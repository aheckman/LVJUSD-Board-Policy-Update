## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 5090, a Governing Board member who wishes to resign must file a written resignation with the County Superintendent of Schools having jurisdiction over the district. The resignation results in a vacancy on the Board which, pursuant to Government Code 1770 and Education Code 5091-5093, requires the Board to either order an election or make a provisional appointment as appropriate, unless the vacancy occurs within four months of the end of the Board member's term in which case the Board will take no action. See BB 9223 - Filling Vacancies for information about timelines, processes, and eligibility requirements for filling vacancies.
A member of the Governing Board who wishes to resign from the Board shall file a written resignation with the County Superintendent of Schools.  (Education Code 5090)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional.
The resigning Board member shall also notify the Board and give a copy of his/her written resignation to the Board secretary.

The resignation shall become effective when filed with the County Superintendent, except when a deferred effective date is specified in the resignation. A Board member may not defer the effective date of his/her resignation for more than 60 days after he/she files the resignation with the County Superintendent.  (Education Code 5090, 5091)

Once filed, a written resignation, whether specifying a deferred effective date or otherwise, shall be irrevocable.  (Education Code 5090)

A Board member who tenders his/her resignation with a deferred effective date shall, until the effective date of the resignation, continue to exercise all the powers of the office, except that he/she shall not have the right to vote for his/her successor in an action taken by the Board to make a provisional appointment.
