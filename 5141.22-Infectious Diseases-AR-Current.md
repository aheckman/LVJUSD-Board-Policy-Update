## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation may be modified to reflect district practice.
Prevention and Mitigation Plan

The Superintendent or designee shall work with state and local health officials to develop and regularly update a plan to prevent and mitigate the spread of infectious diseases.  Components of the plan may include, but are not necessarily limited to:  

	A communication strategy for informing students, parents/guardians, staff, and the community about the disease(s), including symptoms, complications, transmission, and current recommendations from state and local departments of public health 
	 
	Protocols for assessing when campus closures are necessary and when campus(es) may reopen 
	 
	Alternative means of instruction, schedules, and attendance, including the provision of instruction to students with disabilities, English learners, and foster or homeless youth, in the event of campus closures or partial closures 
	 
	Guidelines regarding preventative measures such as social distancing, personal protective equipment, temperature checks, and/or any other health screening allowed by law 
	 
	Protocols regarding the acquisition and provision of personal protective equipment and other supplies
	 
	Procedures for the cancellation or alteration of extracurricular activities and field trips
	 
	Protocols for transportation of students using district vehicles 
	 
	Information on effective hygiene practices 
	 
	Provisions for continuing free and reduced-price meal services 
	 
	Processes for protecting students who are at higher risk from the disease 
	 
	Programs that enhance a positive school climate and foster the emotional well-being of all students 
	 
	Guidelines for cleaning and sanitization of district facilities and equipment 
	 
	Protocols for visitors and outside groups that utilize district facilities
	 
	Staff training

The Superintendent or designee shall immediately report to the local health officer the presence or suspected presence of any communicable disease.  (17 CCR 2508)

Universal Precautions in the Classroom

CSBA NOTE: The following standards are based upon the universal precautions required for use by employees pursuant to 8 CCR 5193 and should be modified to reflect district practice.  See also the California Department of Education's (CDE) Science Safety Handbook for more information about laboratory safety and universal precautions.
Before students work with blood, blood products, or other body fluids, the teacher shall explain the potentially hazardous nature of blood and body fluids in the transmission of various agents from one person to another and the specific procedures and safety precautions to be used in the lesson.

The following precautions shall be used when students are working with blood or other body fluids:

	Before and after exposure to blood or other body fluids, students shall wash their hands with soap and water and cover any existing cut, wound, or open sore with a sterile dressing.
	 
	Students shall wear gloves or other personal protective equipment as appropriate.
	
	CSBA NOTE: CDE's Science Safety Handbook recommends that alternatives to fresh human blood, such as blood that is acquired from a local blood bank that has been tested and found to be free of hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus, be utilized for experiments that require blood samples. If the district permits fresh human blood samples from students to be utilized for such purposes, CDE's Science Safety Handbook states that human blood sampling may only occur on a voluntary basis, that the blood draw should be self-administered and performed in a manner consistent with the district's exposure control plan, and that goggles and gloves should be utilized. As students with specified known medical conditions are not permitted to participate, districts should have a process in place which ensures that students with such medical conditions need not share that information with their teacher(s) or other students.
	Blood typing or similar experiments may be conducted by teacher demonstrations. When being performed individually, students shall work with their own blood or use prepackaged ABO/Rh blood cell kits that have vials of blood previously tested for transmissible agents.
	 
	
		For finger punctures, students shall use individual sterile lancets that have engineered sharps injury protection and shall not reuse them.
		 
		Before the finger is punctured, it shall be wiped with a piece of cotton that has been immersed in alcohol.
		 
		If bleeding persists after the finger is punctured, the student shall apply a sterile bandage using moderate pressure.
		​​​​​​​
	
	
	Lancets and any other materials contaminated with blood or body fluids shall be discarded into a solution consisting of one part bleach to 10 parts water (1:10), made fresh daily.
	 
	At the end of the class, surfaces shall be wiped with alcohol or a solution of one part bleach to 10 parts water.
