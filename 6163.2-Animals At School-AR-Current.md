Use of Animals for Instructional Purposes

CSBA NOTE:  The following section is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice. 
Before any student or employee brings an animal to school for an instructional purpose, he/she shall receive written permission from the principal or designee.  The principal or designee shall give such permission only after he/she has provided written notification to all parents/guardians of students in the affected class, asking them to verify whether their child has any known allergies, asthma, or other health condition that may be aggravated by the animal's presence.  When a parent/guardian has provided notification that his/her child has an allergy, asthma, or other health condition that may be aggravated by the animal, the principal shall take appropriate measures to protect the student from exposure to the animal.

All animals brought to school must be in good physical condition and must be appropriately immunized.  The teacher shall ensure that the species of animal is appropriate for the instructional purpose and age and maturity of the students.

All animals brought to school shall be adequately fed, effectively controlled, humanely treated, and properly housed in cages or containers suitable for the species.  The teacher shall ensure that cages and containers are cleaned regularly and that waste materials are removed and disposed of in an appropriate manner.

The teacher shall ensure that students receive instructions regarding the proper handling of and personal hygiene around animals.

Except for service animals, as defined below, all animals are prohibited on school transportation services.  (Education Code 39839; 13 CCR 1216)

Use of Service Animals by Individuals with Disabilities

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 28 CFR 35.136, as amended by 75 Fed. Reg. 178, a district is mandated to modify its policies, practices, and procedures to permit an individual with a disability to use at school a service animal, as defined in the paragraph below, when the work or task performed by the service animal is directly related to the individual's disability. In Sullivan v. Vallejo USD, the court held that a disabled student had a right to use a service dog at school. According to the court, the district was required to incorporate the dog into the student's educational program and to accommodate the dog in a way that did not impinge on the legitimate rights of others. Thus, the student's placement might need to be changed because of the teacher's severe allergies; however, the district could not alter the student's placement to accommodate the purely personal feelings of students or faculty about dogs in the school environment. 
For an individual with a disability, service animal means any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks related to the individual's disability and for his/her benefit.  For example, for an individual who is blind or has low vision, a service animal would mean a dog that helps him/her with vision, navigation, and other tasks; for an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing, a service animal would mean a dog that alerts him/her to the presence of people or sounds; and for an individual with psychiatric or neurological disabilities, a service animal would mean a dog that assists him/her by preventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive behaviors.  (28 CFR 35.104)

Individuals with disabilities may be accompanied on school premises and on school transportation by service animals, including specially trained guide dogs, signal dogs, or service dogs.  (Education Code 39839; Civil Code 54.2; 28 CFR 35.136)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 28 CFR 35.136, a miniature horse may be permitted as a service animal if the conditions stated in the following paragraph are satisfied. 
The Superintendent or designee may permit the use of a miniature horse as a service animal when the horse has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, provided that:  (28 CFR 35.136)
 

	The district's facility can accommodate the type, size, and weight of the horse.
	 
	The individual has sufficient control of the horse.
	 
	The horse is housebroken.
	 
	The horse's presence in the specific facility does not compromise legitimate safety requirements of the facility.


The Superintendent or designee may ask any individual with a disability to remove his/her service animal from school premises or transportation if the animal is out of control and the individual does not take effective action to control it or the animal is not housebroken.  When an individual's service animal is excluded, he/she shall be given an opportunity to participate in the service, program, or activity without having the service animal present.  (Education Code 39839; Civil Code 54.2; 28 CFR 35.136)
