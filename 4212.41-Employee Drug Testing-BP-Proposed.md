## Policy Content

The Board of Education maintains a drug- and alcohol-free workplace.  In accordance with law, all employees shall render service without using, possessing, being impaired by, or being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Pre-Employment Drug/Alcohol Testing for Safety-Sensitive Positions

Because students and staff have the right to a safe and secure campus where they are free from physical and psychological harm, the Board authorizes the testing of prospective employees in safety-sensitive positions for drug and alcohol use.  In accordance with SB 88, any employee who transports students in a District vehicle and drives in excess of forty (40) hours in a school year is subject to the District's program.

Once a conditional offer of employment has been made, prospective employees in these identified positions shall undergo a pre-employment drug and alcohol screening for any substance which could impair their ability to safely and effectively perform their job functions.  This screening shall be part of the employee's pre-employment physical examination.

Final selection of a job applicant for a position shall not be made until the applicant has successfully completed the screening.

All testing and medical examinations shall be conducted in accordance with state and federal law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.
