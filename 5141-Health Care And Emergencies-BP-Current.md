## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes the importance of taking appropriate action whenever an emergency threatens the safety, health, or welfare of a student at school or during school-sponsored activities.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop procedures to ensure that first aid and/or medical attention is provided as quickly as possible when accidents and injuries to students occur and that parents/guardians are notified as appropriate.

The Superintendent or designee shall ask parents/guardians to provide emergency contact information in order to facilitate communication in the event of an accident or illness.

District staff shall appropriately report and document student accidents.

"Do Not Resuscitate" Orders

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that wish to preclude the acceptance of "do not resuscitate" orders except under very limited circumstances. Districts presented with a "do not resuscitate" order should consult legal counsel as appropriate.
The Board believes that staff members should not be placed in the position of determining whether or not to follow any parental or medical "do not resuscitate" orders.  Staff shall not accept or follow any such orders except under the specific written direction of the Superintendent or designee.  The Superintendent or designee may only direct a staff member to follow a "do not resuscitate" order if he/she has received a written parent/guardian authorization, with an authorized health care provider statement, and an order of an appropriate court.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that parents/guardians who have submitted a "do not resuscitate" order are informed of this policy.

Automated External Defibrillators

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that have or are considering purchasing or receiving a donation of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to be used to treat victims of sudden cardiac arrest. When an AED is placed in a school building, Health and Safety Code 1797.196, as amended by SB 658 (Ch. 264, Statutes of 2015), requires that the principal ensure that employees receive information annually that describes sudden cardiac arrest, the school's emergency response plan, and the proper use of an AED. See the accompanying administrative regulation. Health and Safety Code 1797.196 protects entities and individuals from civil liability resulting from the use of an AED in an emergency as long as certain conditions specified in the law are satisfied.Districts considering placing an AED on school grounds should work closely with medical professionals, the manufacturer of the device, local officials, nonprofit organizations, and the district's risk manager or insurance specialist to ensure that necessary precautions are taken, such as staff training, equipment maintenance and storage, proper placement of the devices, and record-keeping. Local chapters of the American Red Cross and American Heart Association may help provide training and facilitate the purchase of AEDs. District legal counsel should also be consulted.
The Board authorizes the Superintendent or designee to place automated external defibrillators (AEDs) at designated school sites for use by school employees in an emergency.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop guidelines for employees regarding these devices and shall ensure that employees receive information that describes sudden cardiac arrest, the school's emergency response plan, and the proper use of an AED. The guidelines shall also specify the placement, security, and maintenance of the AED.

The authorization of AEDs in district schools shall not be deemed to create a guarantee that an AED will be present or will be used in the case of an emergency, or that a trained employee will be present and/or able to use an AED in an emergency, or that the AED will operate properly.
