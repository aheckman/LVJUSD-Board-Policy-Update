## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The Governing Board may hold a closed session only for purposes expressly authorized by the Brown Act (Government Code 54950-54963), Government Code 3549.1, or by a provision of the Education Code. Prior to recessing to closed session, the Brown Act requires the Board to disclose the items to be discussed in closed session either verbally or by reference to the items as they are described in the posted agenda. Consistent with the Brown Act, Exhibit (1) provides specific language for most types of closed session items. Additionally, the Brown Act requires the Board to publicly report any action taken in closed session and the vote or abstention on that action of every member present. Consistent with the Brown Act, Exhibit (2) provides specific language for reporting out on closed session items following the closed session.
The Governing Board is committed to complying with state open meeting laws and modeling transparency in its conduct of district business. The Board shall hold a closed session during a regular, special, or emergency meeting only for purposes authorized by law.

Each agenda shall contain a general description of each closed session item to be discussed at the meeting as required by law and provided in the accompanying Exhibit (1).  (Education Code 35145, Government Code 54954.2, 54954.5, 54957)

In the open session preceding the closed session, the Board shall disclose the items to be discussed in closed session as specified in this bylaw. The Board may either state the information on the agenda or refer the public to the item(s) as listed by number or letter on the agenda. In the closed session, the Board may consider only those items covered in its statement.  (Government Code 54957, 54957.7)

After the closed session, the Board shall reconvene in open session before adjourning the meeting and, when applicable, shall publicly disclose any actions taken in the closed session, the votes or abstentions thereon, and other disclosures as specified in this bylaw. Such reports may be made in writing or orally at the location announced in the agenda for the closed session as required by law and provided in the accompanying Exhibit (2).  (Education Code 32281; Government Code 54957.1, 54957.7)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54957.1, a document approved or adopted in closed session must be provided to any person who has submitted a written request within 24 hours of the posting of the agenda or who has made a standing request for all documentation as part of a request for meeting notices pursuant to Government Code 54954.1 or 54956.
When an action taken during a closed session involves final approval or adoption of a document, such as a contract or settlement agreement, that becomes public upon such approval or adoption, the Superintendent or designee shall provide a copy of the document to any person present at the conclusion of the closed session who submitted a written request. If the action taken results in one or more substantive amendments, the Superintendent or designee shall make the document available the next business day or when the necessary changes to the document are completed. Whenever copies of an approved agreement will not be immediately released due to an amendment, the Board president shall orally summarize the substance of the amendment for those present at the end of the closed session.  (Government Code 54957.1)

Confidentiality

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54963, a Board member who discloses confidential information received in a closed session may be referred to the local grand jury or may be subject to action in a court of law. For a definition of confidential information and the actions that may be taken against a Board member if such information is disclosed, see BB 9011 - Disclosure of Confidential/Privileged Information.
A Board member shall not disclose confidential information received in closed session unless the Board authorizes the disclosure of that information or the information has been publicly reported by the District.  (Government Code 54963)

The Board shall not disclose any information that is protected by state or federal law. In addition, no victim or alleged victim of tortious sexual conduct or child abuse shall be identified in any Board agenda, notice, announcement, or report required by the Brown Act, unless the identity of the person has previously been publicly disclosed.  (Government Code 54957.7, 54961)

Personnel Matters: Appointment, Employment, Performance Evaluation, or Discipline/Dismissal/Release

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54957 authorizes the use of closed sessions to consider and, as applicable, vote on the appointment, employment, evaluation of performance, discipline, or dismissal of an employee. Consistent with Government Code 54957.1 and 54957.7, this provision may be interpreted to include a demotion or other change in employment status. For the purpose of these closed sessions, "employee" includes an officer or independent contractor who functions as an officer or employee but excludes Board members. The Attorney General has concluded in 59 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 532 (1976) that it is appropriate to use a closed session to discuss and evaluate Superintendent performance. However, the Board may not discuss or act upon any proposed change in compensation other than a reduction of compensation that results from the imposition of discipline under this exception, although such a discussion may occur under Government Code 54957.6.
The Board may hold a closed session under the "personnel exception" to consider the appointment, employment, performance evaluation, discipline, dismissal, or change in employment status of an employee. Such a closed session shall not include discussion or action on proposed compensation except for a reduction of compensation that results from the imposition of discipline.  (Government Code 54957, 54957.1)

Personnel Matters: Specific Complaints or Charges

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54957 authorizes the use of closed sessions to consider and, as applicable, vote on complaints or charges against an employee, so long as the district provides the employee with 24-hour notice in advance of the closed session. Failure to provide such notice will render any action taken by the Board in the closed session null and void. Determining whether a "specific complaint or charge" is involved is usually fact-specific and the Board should consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel as appropriate.In Furtado v. Sierra Community College District, the court held that the term "specific complaints or charges" as used in Government Code 54957 does not include negative comments in an employee's performance evaluation. In another decision, Bell v. Vista Unified School District, the court determined that a presentation to the Board by a district staff member regarding an employee's violation of a California Interscholastic Federation rule constituted a "complaint or charge" and thus the employee was entitled to 24-hour notice. Yet another ruling, Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, held that when a board rejects its hearing officer's findings of fact and conducts its own hearing, the employee must be given 24-hour notice.Furthermore, an Attorney General opinion (78 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 218 (1995)) has clarified that a probationary certificated employee does not have the right to an open session when the Board is discussing whether to reemploy the employee for a third consecutive school year. Education Code 44929.21 allows the Board to non-reelect a probationary certificated employee at the end of the first or second school year as long as written notice is given in accordance with law. For more information, see AR 4117.6 - Decision Not to Rehire.
The Board may hold a closed session to hear complaints or charges brought against an employee, unless the employee who is the subject of the complaint requests an open session. Before the Board holds a closed session on specific complaints or charges brought against an employee, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the employee receives written notice of the right to have the complaints or charges heard in open session. This notice shall be delivered personally or by mail at least 24 hours before the time of the closed session.  (Government Code 54957)

Personnel Matters: Application for Early Withdraw of Funds in Deferred Compensation Plan

The Board may hold a closed session to discuss an employee's application for early withdrawal of funds in a deferred compensation plan when the application is based on financial hardship arising from an unforeseeable emergency due to illness, accident, casualty, or other extraordinary event, as specified in the deferred compensation plan.  (Government Code 54957.10)

Negotiations/Collective Bargaining

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54957.6, the Board is authorized to hold a closed session with the district's designated representatives regarding the salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits to its represented and unrepresented employees, including the Superintendent. However, Government Code 54957.6 explicitly prohibits the Board from taking final action in closed session on the proposed compensation of one or more unrepresented employees. Additionally, the Attorney General has concluded in 98 Ops.Cal.Atty. Gen. 41 (2015) that this exception does not permit the Board to meet in closed session with its designated representative to discuss the negotiation of a project labor agreement because the contractors and laborers covered by such an agreement are not district employees.
The Board may meet in closed session to review the Board's position and/or instruct its designated representative(s) regarding salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits of its represented and unrepresented employees, and, for represented employees, any other matter within the statutorily provided scope of representation. A closed session regarding salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits may include discussions of the district's available funds and funding priorities, but only insofar as they relate to providing instructions to the Board's designated representative. Final action on the proposed compensation of one or more unrepresented employees shall not be taken in closed session.  (Government Code 54957.6)

The Board also may meet in closed session with a state conciliator who has intervened in proceedings regarding any of the purposes enumerated in Government Code 54957.6.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54957.1, the Board may vote on an agreement regarding labor negotiations in closed session and then publicly report after the agreement is final and has been accepted or ratified by the other party. For a new collective bargaining agreement, however, it is also common practice for Boards to vote in open session rather than closed session.
Pursuant to Government Code 54957.1, approval in closed session of an agreement regarding labor negotiations with represented employees pursuant to Government Code 54957.6 shall be reported after the agreement is final and has been accepted or ratified by the other party. However, the Board may, at its sole discretion, vote on such an agreement is open session.  (Government Code 54957.1)

CSBA NOTE: The Educational Employment Relations Act (EERA) (Government Code 3540-3549.3) lists certain exemptions from the Brown Act related to negotiations. The critical exemption for districts is that the Brown Act does not apply to a meeting of the Board if the meeting is exclusively for the purpose of discussing the Board's position regarding any matter within the scope of representation and determining how to instruct its designated representatives, regardless of whether its designated representatives attended. If it is combined with another closed session item and/or an open session item, then the Brown Act applies. It is recommended that the Board utilize this provision of the EERA sparingly and consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or legal counsel prior to meeting under this provision.
Pursuant to Government Code 3549.1, the Board may, without following the requirements of the Brown Act, meet in closed session exclusively for the purpose of discussing its position regarding any matter within the scope of representation or for the purpose of instructing its designated representatives. The Board shall not discuss any other item at any such closed session.  (Government Code 3549.1)

Matters Related to Students

CSBA NOTE: This following section should be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 35146, 48912, and 49070 permit a Board to consider in closed session any disciplinary action (except expulsion) against a student, any other action against a student, and a challenge to a student record. The district is required to provide the student and the student's parent/guardian with advance notice that the disciplinary action will be considered in closed session and that the parent/guardian may, within 48 hours from receipt of the notice, request the district to have the item heard in a public open session rather than in closed session. While Education Code 35146, 48912, and 49070 do not provide the days or hours prior to the meeting by which the notice to the student and the student's parent/guardian must be given, it is recommended that the district notify the student and the student's parent/guardian at least 72 hours before the meeting, including for special meetings.
If a public hearing would lead to the disclosure of confidential student information such as grades or discipline information, the Board shall meet in closed session to consider a suspension, disciplinary action, any other action against a student except expulsion, or a challenge to a student record. At least 72 hours prior to the start of the meeting of which the closed session is a part, the Superintendent or designee, on behalf of the Board, shall, in writing, by registered or certified mail or by personal service, notify the student and the student's parent/guardian of the intent of the Board to hear the item in closed session. If a written request for open session is received from the student or the student's parents/guardians within 48 hours of receiving the notice, the meeting shall be public, except that any discussion at that meeting which may be in conflict with the right to privacy of any other student shall remain in closed session.  (Education Code 35146, 48912, 49070)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48918 requires a hearing to determine whether a student should be expelled. The hearing may be held by the Board, a hearing officer, or an administrative panel. See BP/AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process.
If the Board conducts an expulsion hearing pursuant to Board Policy 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process, the Board shall do so in closed session unless the student submits a written request at least five days before the date of the hearing that the hearing be held in open session. Regardless of whether the expulsion hearing is conducted in open or closed session, the Board shall meet in closed session for the purpose of deliberating and determining whether the student should be expelled.  (Education Code 48918)

CSBA NOTE: Although Education Code 48918 states that student expulsion records are "nonprivileged, disclosable public records" and the Attorney General in 80 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 85 (1997) has opined that districts must disclose the student's name, the court in Rim of the World Unified School District v. San Bernardino County Superior Court held that the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 USC 1232g) preempts state law and prohibits the disclosure of student expulsion records to the public. Failure to comply with FERPA may lead to loss of federal funding. Because of the potential conflict between state and federal law, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or legal counsel prior to adopting the following paragraph.
In order to protect student privacy rights provided in 20 USC 1232g or other applicable laws, the identity of a student shall not be listed in the agenda and, unless the item is heard in open session, shall not be included in any report after closed session. Additionally, a student matter shall be listed in the open session portion of the agenda with the same description and numbering system as it was on the closed session portion of the agenda.

Security Matters

The Board may meet in closed session with the Governor, Attorney General, District Attorney, district legal counsel, sheriff or chief of police, or their respective deputies, or a security consultant or a security operations manager, on matters posing a threat to the security of public buildings; to the security of essential public services, including water, drinking water, wastewater treatment, natural gas service, and electric service; or to the public's right of access to public services or public facilities. Such discussions may be held in closed session during an emergency meeting called pursuant to Board Bylaw 9320 - Meetings and Notices and Board Bylaw/Exhibit (1) 9323.2 - Actions By The Board.

The Board may also meet in closed session to consult with law enforcement officials on the development of a plan for tactical responses to criminal incidents and to approve the plan.  (Education Code 32281)

Real Property Negotiations

CSBA NOTE: The Attorney General opined in 94 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 82 (2011) that only three subjects related to real property negotiations may be considered in closed session: (1) the amount of consideration the local agency is willing to pay or accept in exchange for the real property rights to be acquired or transferred, (2) the form, manner, and timing of how that consideration will be paid, and (3) items that are essential to arriving at the authorized price and payment terms.
The Board may meet in closed session with its real property negotiator prior to the purchase, sale, exchange, or lease of real property by or for the district in order to grant its negotiator authority regarding the price and terms of payment for the property.  (Government Code 54956.8)

Anticipated Litigation/Initiation of Litigation

Based on the advice of its legal counsel, the Board may hold a closed session to confer with or receive advice from its legal counsel regarding anticipated litigation or whether to initiate litigation when discussion of either matter in open session would prejudice the district's position with respect to such litigation. For this purpose, "litigation" means any adjudicatory proceeding, including eminent domain, before a court, administrative body exercising its adjudicatory authority, hearing officer, or arbitrator.  (Government Code 54956.9)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54956.9, the district is considered to be a "party," or to have "significant exposure," to litigation if any of its officers or employees is a party or has significant exposure to the litigation under circumstances specified below.
Litigation is considered to be "anticipated" when, in the Board's opinion based on the advice of its legal counsel regarding the existing facts and circumstances, there is a significant exposure to litigation against the district or against a district officer or employee based on prior or prospective activities or alleged activities during and potentially during the course and scope of that office or employment.  (Government Code 54956.9)

Existing facts and circumstances are limited to the following:  (Government Code 54956.9)

	Facts and circumstances that might result in litigation against the district but which the district believes are not yet known to potential plaintiff(s)
	 
	Facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, an accident, disaster, incident, or transactional occurrence which might result in litigation against the district, which are already known to potential plaintiff(s)
	 
	The receipt of a claim pursuant to the Government Claims Act or a written threat of litigation from a potential plaintiff
	 
	A threat of litigation made by a person in an open meeting on a specific matter within the responsibility of the Board
	 
	A threat of litigation made by a person outside of an open meeting on a specific matter within the responsibility of the Board, provided that the district official or employee receiving knowledge of the threat made a record of the statement before the meeting

CSBA NOTE: Under certain circumstances, Government Code 54954.5 enables multiple anticipated litigation items to be grouped together into one closed session agenda item so long as the number of items is listed in the agenda. However, given the complexity and nuance of the different disclosure requirements for anticipated litigation items, it is recommended that each anticipated litigation item be listed as a separate agenda item.In Fowler v. City of Lafayette, the appellate court clarified that when an item is agendized in closed session based on Item #5 above, then Government Code 54956.9 requires that the statement be made available to the public. Upon receiving a threat of litigation in such a manner, the Board should consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel as appropriate. The following paragraph should be revised to reflect district practice.
Each agenda item related to anticipated litigation shall only contain one such matter. For an anticipated litigation item that is anticipated based on Items #2, #3, or #5 above, the agenda item shall also include the facts or circumstances that might result in litigation, the claim or written threat of litigation, or the record of the threat. However, the agenda item shall not identify the alleged victim of unlawful or tortious sexual conduct or anyone making the threat on the alleged victim's behalf, or identify a public employee who is the alleged perpetrator of any unlawful or tortious conduct upon which a threat of litigation is based, unless the identity of the person has been publicly disclosed.  (Government Code 54956.9)

Existing Litigation

Based on the advice of its legal counsel, the Board may hold a closed session to confer with or receive advice from its legal counsel regarding existing litigation when discussion of the matter in open session would prejudice the district's position with respect to such litigation. Litigation is considered to be "existing" when the district has been named a party to the litigation or a district officer or employee has been named a party to the litigation based on prior or prospective activities or alleged activities during the course and scope of that office or employment, including litigation in which involves whether an activity is outside the course and scope of the office or employment. For this purpose, "litigation" means any adjudicatory proceeding, including eminent domain, before a court, administrative body exercising its adjudicatory authority, hearing officer, or arbitrator.  (Government Code 54956.9)

Tort, Public, or Workers' Compensation Liability

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts participating in a joint powers agency (JPA) for insurance pooling or in a self-insurance authority.
The Board may meet in closed session to discuss a claim for the payment of tort liability losses, public liability losses, or workers' compensation liability incurred by a joint powers agency (JPA) formed for the purpose of insurance pooling or self-insurance authority of which the district is a member.  (Government Code 54956.95)

Joint Powers Agency Issues

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54956.96, a JPA may adopt a provision, either through a policy or through the joint powers agreement, authorizing a school district Board member serving on the JPA board to disclose confidential information received during the JPA board's closed session under the circumstances specified below. Government Code 54954.5 provides an agenda description for the purpose of this closed session. The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that participate in a JPA that has adopted such a provision.
When the board of the JPA has so authorized and upon advice of district legal counsel, the Board may meet in closed session in order to receive, discuss, and take action concerning information that has direct financial or liability implications for the district and that was obtained in a closed session of a JPA of which the district is a member. During the Board's closed session, a Board member serving on the JPA board may disclose confidential information acquired during a closed session of the JPA to fellow Board members.  (Government Code 54956.96))

Review of Audit Report from California State Auditor's Office

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54956.75 authorizes the Board to meet in closed session to discuss a confidential final draft audit report from the California State Auditor's Office. This authority relates to situations in which a member of the legislature has requested the California State Auditor's Office to audit a school district. This audit is separate from the annual audit that districts must conduct pursuant to Education Code 41020. The law does not authorize the Board to meet in closed session to discuss the district's annual audit.
Upon receipt of a confidential final draft audit report from the California State Auditor's Office and before the report has been made public, the Board may meet in closed session to discuss its response to that report. After public release of the report from the California State Auditor's Office, any Board meeting to discuss the report shall be conducted in open session, unless exempted from that requirement by some other provision of law.  (Government Code 54956.75)

Review of Assessment Instruments

The Board may meet in closed session to review the contents of any student assessment instrument approved or adopted for the statewide testing system. Before any such meeting, the Board shall agree by resolution to accept any terms or conditions established by the State Board of Education for this review. (Education Code 60617)

<strong>Personnel Matters: Appointment, Employment, Performance Evaluation, or Discipline/Dismissal/Release</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='gMw877' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54957 authorizes the use of closed sessions to consider and, as applicable, vote on the appointment, employment, evaluation of performance, discipline, or dismissal of an employee. Consistent with Government Code 54957.1 and 54957.7, this provision may be interpreted to include a demotion or other change in employment status. For the purpose of these closed sessions, "employee" includes an officer or independent contractor who functions as an officer or employee but excludes Board members. The Attorney General has concluded in 59 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 532 (1976) that it is appropriate to use a closed session to discuss and evaluate Superintendent performance. However, the Board may not discuss or act upon any proposed change in compensation other than a reduction of compensation that results from the imposition of discipline under this exception, although such a discussion may occur under Government Code 54957.6.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="ODQyNQ3" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22ODQyNQ3%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22gMw877%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1702496899%2C%22text%22%3A%22Government%20Code%2054957%20authorizes%20the%20use%20of%20closed%20sessions%20to%20consider%20and%2C%20as%20applicable%2C%20vote%20on%20the%20appointment%2C%20employment%2C%20evaluation%20of%20performance%2C%20discipline%2C%20or%20dismissal%20of%20an%20employee.%20Consistent%20with%20Government%20Code%2054957.1%20and%2054957.7%2C%20this%20provision%20may%20be%20interpreted%20to%20include%20a%20demotion%20or%20other%20change%20in%20employment%20status.%20For%20the%20purpose%20of%20these%20closed%20sessions%2C%20%5C%22employee%5C%22%20includes%20an%20officer%20or%20independent%20contractor%20who%20functions%20as%20an%20officer%20or%20employee%20but%20excludes%20Board%20members.%20The%20Attorney%20General%20has%20concluded%20in%2059%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%20532%20%281976%29%20that%20it%20is%20appropriate%20to%20use%20a%20closed%20session%20to%20discuss%20and%20evaluate%20Superintendent%20performance.%20However%2C%20the%20Board%20may%20not%20discuss%20or%20act%20upon%20any%20proposed%20change%20in%20compensation%20other%20than%20a%20reduction%20of%20compensation%20that%20results%20from%20the%20imposition%20of%20discipline%20under%20this%20exception%2C%20although%20such%20a%20discussion%20may%20occur%20under%20Government%20Code%2054957.6.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-ODQyNQ3" title="CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54957 authorizes the us..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
The Board may hold a closed session under the &quot;personnel exception&quot; to consider the appointment, employment, performance evaluation, discipline, dismissal, or change in employment status of an employee.

<strong>Personnel Matters: Specific Complaints or Charges</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='MMw878' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54957 authorizes the use of closed sessions to consider and, as applicable, vote on complaints or charges against an employee, so long as the district provides the employee with 24-hour notice in advance of the closed session. Failure to provide such notice will render any action taken by the Board in the closed session null and void. Determining whether a "specific complaint or charge" is involved is usually fact-specific and the Board should consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel as appropriate.<br><br>In Furtado v. Sierra Community College District, the court held that the term "specific complaints or charges" as used in Government Code 54957 does not include negative comments in an employee's performance evaluation. In another decision, Bell v. Vista Unified School District, the court determined that a presentation to the Board by a district staff member regarding an employee's violation of a California Interscholastic Federation rule constituted a "complaint or charge" and thus the employee was entitled to 24-hour notice. Yet another ruling, Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, held that when a board rejects its hearing officer's findings of fact and conducts its own hearing, the employee must be given 24-hour notice.<br><br>Furthermore, an Attorney General opinion (78 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 218 (1995)) has clarified that a probationary certificated employee does not have the right to an open session when the Board is discussing whether to reemploy the employee for a third consecutive school year. Education Code 44929.21 allows the Board to non-reelect a probationary certificated employee at the end of the first or second school year as long as written notice is given in accordance with law.

Additionally, the Attorney General has concluded in 98 Ops.Cal.Atty.

<div id='zNg881' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The Educational Employment Relations Act (EERA) (Government Code 3540-3549.3) lists certain exemptions from the Brown Act related to negotiations. The critical exemption for districts is that the Brown Act does not apply to a meeting of the Board if the meeting is exclusively for the purpose of discussing the Board's position regarding any matter within the scope of representation and determining how to instruct its designated representatives, regardless of whether its designated representatives attended. If it is combined with another closed session item and/or an open session item, then the Brown Act applies. It is recommended that the Board utilize this provision of the EERA sparingly and consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or legal counsel prior to meeting under this provision.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="ODQyNQ7" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22ODQyNQ7%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22zNg881%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1702496985%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20Educational%20Employment%20Relations%20Act%20%28EERA%29%20%28Government%20Code%203540-3549.3%29%20lists%20certain%20exemptions%20from%20the%20Brown%20Act%20related%20to%20negotiations.%20The%20critical%20exemption%20for%20districts%20is%20that%20the%20Brown%20Act%20does%20not%20apply%20to%20a%20meeting%20of%20the%20Board%20if%20the%20meeting%20is%20exclusively%20for%20the%20purpose%20of%20discussing%20the%20Board%27s%20position%20regarding%20any%20matter%20within%20the%20scope%20of%20representation%20and%20determining%20how%20to%20instruct%20its%20designated%20representatives%2C%20regardless%20of%20whether%20its%20designated%20representatives%20attended.%20If%20it%20is%20combined%20with%20another%20closed%20session%20item%20and/or%20an%20open%20session%20item%2C%20then%20the%20Brown%20Act%20applies.%20It%20is%20recommended%20that%20the%20Board%20utilize%20this%20provision%20of%20the%20EERA%20sparingly%20and%20consult%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20legal%20counsel%20prior%20to%20meeting%20under%20this%20provision.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-ODQyNQ7" title="CSBA NOTE: The Educational Employment Relations Ac..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
