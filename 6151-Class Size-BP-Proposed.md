## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that smaller classes may contribute to student learning by allowing teachers to better identify and respond to individual student needs.  In accordance with negotiated employee agreements and state law, the Board shall establish class size limits appropriate for each grade level or subject taught and conducive to the effective use of teaching staff.

The highest priority for maintaining small class sizes shall be in the primary grades in order to support young students as they acquire the basic skills that serve as the foundation for subsequent learning. Other priorities shall be established in accordance with the goals and strategies identified in the District's local control and accountability plan (LCAP).

For grades K-3, the District shall annually make progress toward maintaining an average class of not more than 24 students, unless an alternative annual average class size for each school site is collectively bargained.  (Education Code 42238.02; 5 CCR 15498-15498.3)

Transitional kindergarten classes established pursuant to Education Code 48000 shall be included in the calculation of average class enrollment for kindergarten.

At the secondary level, District priorities for class size reduction shall focus on English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and other courses that are necessary for completion of graduation requirements and shall be aligned with student needs as identified in the District's LCAP.

For students who require special education and related services, the ratio of instructional adults to students in group services shall be dependent on the needs of the students. However, for children ages 3-5 years who are placed in group services, the teacher-child ratio shall be less than 1:8 and the adult-child ratio shall be less than 1:24. For children ages 3-5 years who are identified as severely disabled, the ratio of instructional adults to children shall not exceed 1:5.  (Education Code 8264.8, 56441.5)

The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board with an analysis of staffing and school facilities needs and other costs related to class size reduction proposals.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board regarding the impact of the class size reduction program on student achievement and other outcomes such as changes in school climate and student engagement.
