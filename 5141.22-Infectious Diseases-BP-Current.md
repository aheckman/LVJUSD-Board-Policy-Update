## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be modified to reflect district practice.In order to help protect the safety of students and staff, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that districts develop plans for dealing with infectious disease outbreaks, including influenza or coronavirus pandemics.  These contingency plans should be incorporated into the district's emergency and disaster preparedness plan.  See AR 3516 - Emergencies and Disaster Preparedness Plan. Also see the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' School District (K-12) Pandemic Influenza Planning Checklist for components districts may want to consider when developing and updating emergency and disaster preparedness plans.
The Governing Board desires to protect students from risks posed by exposure to infectious diseases while providing a high-quality education for all students. The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with local and state health officials to develop and regularly update a comprehensive plan for disease prevention that promotes preventative measures, mitigation, education, communication, and training of students and staff. All measures to limit the spread of infectious diseases shall be nondiscriminatory and ensure that equity is promoted. 

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly review resources available from health experts to ensure that district programs and operations are based on the most up-to-date information.

The district's comprehensive health education program shall provide age-appropriate information about the nature and symptoms of communicable diseases, their transmission, and how to help prevent the spread of contagious diseases.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Health and Safety Code 120175.5, as added by AB 262 (Ch. 798, Statutes of 2019), local health officers are required to promptly notify and update districts during an outbreak of a communicable disease, or upon the imminent and proximate threat of a communicable disease outbreak or epidemic that threatens the public's health, if, in the opinion of the local health officer, action or inaction on the part of the district might affect the outbreak response efforts. Local health officers are also required to make any relevant information available to districts, including, but not limited to, the locations of concentrations of cases, the number of residents affected, and the measures that districts should take to assist with outbreak response efforts. The local health officers may issue orders to districts to take any action that the health officers deem necessary to control the spread of the communicable disease. 
If the local health officer notifies the district of an outbreak of a communicable disease, or the imminent and proximate threat of a communicable disease outbreak or epidemic that threatens the public's health, the district shall take any action that the health officer deems necessary to control the spread of the disease. The district shall comply with all applicable state and federal privacy laws in regard to any such information received from the local health officer.  (Health and Safety Code 120175.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 8 CCR 5193, employers with one or more employees having occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens must enforce universal precautions to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials; see BP/AR 4119.42/4219.42/4319.42 - Exposure Control Plan for Bloodborne Pathogens for a detailed exposure control plan and BP/AR 4119.43/4219.43/4319.43 - Universal Precautions.  The following optional paragraph addresses the need for students to follow similar procedures.
Students and staff shall observe universal precautions in order to prevent exposure to bloodborne pathogens and to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

The Superintendent or designee shall inform students of the precautions to be used in cases of exposure to blood or other body fluids through injury, accident, or classroom instruction.

Students with Infectious Diseases

CSBA NOTE: In Thomas v. Atascadero Unified School District, a federal court held that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disability under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 USC 794) and that a student with AIDS cannot be excluded from school without evidence that the student poses a risk of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to classmates or teachers.  The following paragraph extends this protection to students with any bloodborne pathogen infection.  8 CCR 5193 defines bloodborne pathogens to include the hepatitis C virus in addition to hepatitis B virus and HIV.See AR 5112.2 - Exclusion from Attendance for information regarding exclusions, including notification of parents/guardians.
The Superintendent or designee shall exclude students from on-campus instruction only in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.  Because bloodborne pathogens such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not casually transmitted, the presence of infectious conditions of this type is not, by itself, sufficient reason to exclude students from attending school.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph encourages parents/guardians to notify the school if their child has an infectious disease so that staff can assist in maintaining the child's health. However, the law does not require parents/guardians to inform school officials of a student's medical condition; thus, a student cannot be penalized because the parent/guardian did not provide such notification.Both state and federal law (Education Code 49060-49069.7; 20 USC 1232g) require that student health information remain confidential. In the event that a parent/guardian authorizes the district to disclose the fact that the student has an infectious disease, it is recommended that any decision to inform staff should be made by the Superintendent or designee, the student, and the student's parent/guardian, in consultation with district legal counsel.
Parents/guardians are encouraged to inform the Superintendent or designee if their child has an infectious disease so that school staff may work cooperatively with the student's parents/guardians to minimize exposure to other diseases in the school setting. If necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall inform the local health official of any potential outbreak.  The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that student confidentiality and privacy rights are strictly observed in accordance with law.
