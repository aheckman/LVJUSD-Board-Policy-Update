## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes its responsibility to ensure accountability to the public for the performance of the District and each District school. The Board shall regularly review the effectiveness of District programs, personnel, and fiscal operations, with a focus on the capacity to improve student achievement. The Board shall establish appropriate processes and measures to monitor results and to evaluate progress toward accomplishing the District's vision and goals set forth in the local control and accountability plan (LCAP).

District and school performance shall be annually evaluated based on multiple measures specified in the California Accountability and Continuous Improvement System as reported on the California School Dashboard.

The District and each District school shall demonstrate comparable improvement in academic achievement for all numerically significant student subgroups. Numerically significant subgroups include ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, long-term English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and students experiencing homelessness, when the subgroup consists of at least 30 students with a valid test score or 15 foster youth, long-term English learners, or students experiencing homelessness.  (Education Code 52052)

The Superintendent shall provide regular reports to the Board and the public regarding District and school performance. Opportunities for feedback from students, parents/guardians, staff, and community members shall be made available as part of any review and evaluation of District programs and operations and as part of the development or annual update of the LCAP.

Evaluation results may be used as a basis for revising District or school goals, updating the LCAP or other comprehensive plans, identifying and developing strategies to address disparities in achievement among student subgroups, implementing programmatic changes, determining the need for additional support and assistance, awarding incentives or rewards, and establishing other performance-based consequences.

The District shall accept technical assistance or other intervention that may be required pursuant to Education Code 52071 or 52072. If the County Superintendent of Schools is required to provide technical assistance to the District, the District shall accept the technical assistance by providing timely documentation to, and maintaining regular communication with, the County Superintendent.  (Education Code 52071)
