## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to promote effective communication from the District and/or school to families to keep families informed regarding educational programs, school operations, and the legal rights of students and parents/guardians. The Superintendent or designee shall send parents/guardians all notifications required by law and any other notifications the Superintendent or designee believes will promote familial understanding and involvement.

Notice of the rights and responsibilities of parents/guardians as specified in Education Code 48980 shall be sent at the beginning of each academic year and may be provided by regular mail, in electronic form when so requested by the parent/guardian, or by any other method normally used by the District for written communication with parents/guardians.  (Education Code 48981)

No activity specified in Education Code 48980 shall be undertaken with respect to any particular student unless the student's parent/guardian has been informed of such action through the annual notification or other separate special notification. Such notice shall state the activity that will be undertaken and the approximate date on which the activity will occur.  (Education Code 48983-48984)

The annual notification shall include a request that the parent/guardian sign the notice and return it to the school or, if the notice is provided in electronic format, that the parent/guardian submit a signed acknowledgment of receipt of the notice to the school. The parent/guardian's signature is not required. Any signature is an acknowledgment of receipt of the information but does not indicate that consent to participate in any particular program has been given or withheld.  (Education Code 48982)

Whenever a student enrolls in a District school during the school year, the student's parents/guardians shall be given all required parental notifications at that time.

Notifications shall be presented in an understandable and uniform format.

When necessary, the District shall provide notifications to qualified individuals with disabilities in alternative formats, such as braille, large font, or audio recordings, to enable such individuals to effectively participate in any program, service, or activity, as required by law.

Whenever 15 percent or more of the students enrolled in a District school speak a single primary language other than English, as determined from the California Department of Education census data collected pursuant to Education Code 52164, all notices sent to the parent/guardian of any such student shall, in addition to being written in English, be written in the primary language, and may be responded to either in English or the primary language.  (Education Code 48981, 48985)

Whenever an employee learns that a student's parent/guardian is unable to understand the District's printed notifications for any reason, the employee shall inform the principal or designee, who shall work with the parent/guardian to establish other appropriate means of communication.
