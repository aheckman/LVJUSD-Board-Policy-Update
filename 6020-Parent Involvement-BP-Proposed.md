## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that parents/guardians are their children's first and most influential teachers and that sustained parent/guardian involvement in the education of their children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive school environment. The Superintendent or designee shall work with parents/guardians and family members to jointly develop and agree upon policy and strategies to meaningfully involve parents/guardians and family members in District and school activities at all grade levels; advisory, decision-making, and advocacy roles; and activities to support learning at home.

Parents/guardians shall be notified of their rights to be informed about and to participate in their children's education and of the opportunities available to them to do so.

The District's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) shall include goals and strategies for parent/guardian involvement and family engagement, including District efforts to seek parent/guardian input in District and school site decision making and to promote parent/guardian participation in programs for English learners, foster youth, students eligible for free and reduced-price meals, and students with disabilities. (Education Code 42238.02, 52060)

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly evaluate and report to the Board on the effectiveness of the District's parent/guardian and family engagement efforts, including, but not limited to, input from parents/guardians, family members, and school staff on the adequacy of involvement opportunities and on barriers that may inhibit participation.

Title I Schools

The Superintendent or designee shall involve parents/guardians and family members in establishing District expectations and objectives for meaningful parent/guardian and family engagement in schools supported by Title I funding, developing strategies that describe how the District will carry out each activity listed in 20 USC 6318, as contained in the accompanying administrative regulation, and implementing and evaluating such programs, activities, and procedures. As appropriate, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct outreach to all parents/guardians and family members. (Education Code 11503; 20 USC 6318)

When the District's Title I, Part A allocation exceeds the amount specified in 20 USC 6318, the Board shall reserve at least one percent of the funding to implement parent/guardian and family engagement activities and shall distribute at least 90 percent of those reserved funds to eligible schools, with priority given to high-need schools as defined in 20 USC 6631. The Superintendent or designee shall involve parents/guardians and family members of participating students in decisions regarding how the District's Title I funds will be allotted for parent/guardian and family engagement activities. (20 USC 6318)

Expenditures of such funds shall be consistent with the activities specified in this policy and shall include at least one of the following: (20 USC 6318)

	Support for schools and nonprofit organizations in providing professional development for District and school staff regarding parent/guardian and family engagement strategies, which may be provided jointly to teachers, principals, other school leaders, specialized instructional support personnel, paraprofessionals, early childhood educators, and parents/guardians and family members
	 
	Support for programs that reach parents/guardians and family members at home, in the community, and at school
	 
	Dissemination of information on best practices focused on parent/guardian and family engagement, especially best practices for increasing the engagement of economically disadvantaged parents/guardians and family members
	 
	Collaboration, or the provision of subgrants to schools to enable collaboration, with community-based or other organizations or employers with a record of success in improving and increasing parent/guardian and family engagement
	 
	Any other activities and strategies that the District determines are appropriate and consistent with this policy

If the District also receives funds under federal Title IV, Part E, to coordinate and enhance family engagement programs, the Superintendent or designee shall inform parents/guardians and organizations of the existence of Title IV. (20 USC 6318)

The District's Board policy and administrative regulation containing parent/guardian and family engagement strategies shall be incorporated into the District's LCAP in accordance with 20 USC 6312. (20 USC 6318)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each school receiving Title I funds develops a school-level parent/guardian and family engagement policy in accordance with 20 USC 6318.

District and school-level parent/guardian and family engagement policies and administrative regulations shall be distributed to parents/guardians of students participating in Title I programs and shall be available to the local community. Parents/guardians shall be notified of the policy in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, provided in a language the parents/guardians can understand. (20 USC 6318)

Non-Title I Schools

The Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement strategies applicable to each school that does not receive federal Title I funds to encourage the involvement and support of parents/guardians in the education of their children, including, but not limited to, strategies describing how the District and schools will address the purposes and goals described in Education Code 11502. (Education Code 11504)
