A digital signature is defined as an electronic identifier, created by computer, intended by the party using it to have the same force and effect as the use of a manual signature. (Government Code 16.5)

	That, if a certificate is a required component of the electronic signature, the certificate format used by the signer is sufficient for the security and interoperability needs of the District.  

If a notarized signature is required with respect to an electronic signature, the electronic signature of the notary public together with all of the other information required by law to be included in a notarization shall accompany the electronic signature.  (Civil Code 1633.11)

If a statement is required to be signed under penalty of perjury, the electronic signature shall include all of the information to which the declaration pertains together with a declaration under penalty of perjury by the person who submits the electronic signature that the information is true and correct.  (Civil Code 1633.11)
