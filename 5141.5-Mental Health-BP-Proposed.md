Additionally, space that affords privacy and confidentiality of telehealth sessions shall be provided for students and an emergency response plan shall be put in place that lays out all legally-mandated steps to take when a student suddenly begins to exhibit suicidal ideation or other potentially dangerous behavior during a telehealth session.

If a student has an emotional or mental illness that limits a major life activity, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such impairment, or may need special education and related services, the student shall be referred for an evaluation for purposes of determining whether any educational or related services are required in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act or the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, as applicable.  (Education Code 56301-56302; 29 USC 794; 28 CFR 35.108)

Funding Resources

The Superintendent or designee shall explore potential funding sources for District programs and services that support student's mental health.
