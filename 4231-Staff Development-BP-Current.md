## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Staff development is not one of the enumerated items within the scope of collective bargaining pursuant to Government Code 3543.2. However, the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) has found that some aspects of staff development may be negotiable if they are related to an enumerated subject of bargaining, such as working hours, wages, or other enumerated terms or conditions of employment (United Faculty of Contra Costa Community College District v. Contra Costa Community College District). Because the terms "staff development" and "training" are not always clear, their negotiability, in the absence of an agreement, may be determined by PERB on a case-by-case basis.Pursuant to Education Code 45391, a district that expends funds for professional development for any school site staff must consider the needs of its classified school employees to update their skills and learn best practices.Pursuant to Education Code 45387, the Governing Board may authorize a permanent classified employee to attend job-related inservice training with pay during working hours for one or more school days each year.
The Governing Board recognizes that classified staff does essential work that supports a healthy school environment and the educational program. Classified staff shall have opportunities to participate in staff development activities in order to improve job skills, learn best practices, retrain as appropriate in order to meet changing conditions in the district, and/or enhance personal growth.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060-52077 require districts to develop a local control and accountability plan (LCAP) which includes goals aligned with state and local priorities, specific actions aligned to meet those goals, and a budget aligned to fund those specific actions; see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.  The district's staff development program should be aligned with its priorities and goals as outlined in the LCAP and other applicable district and school plans.
The Superintendent or designee shall involve classified staff, site and district administrators, and others, as appropriate, in the development of the district's staff development program.  He/she shall ensure that the district's staff development program is aligned with district goals, school improvement objectives, the local control and accountability plan, and other district and school plans.

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-10 below reflect optional topics for professional development of classified staff specified in Education Code 45391 and may be revised to reflect district practice.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 44277, as amended by SB 1060 (Ch. 199, Statutes of 2014), the district is required to evaluate any program of professional growth it offers to its teachers and classified employees who are involved in direct instruction of students based on specified criteria. For details of the requirement related to teachers, see BP 4131 - Staff Development.
For classroom instructional aides or other classified staff involved in direct instruction of students, staff development activities may also include academic content of the core curriculum, teaching strategies, classroom management, or other training designed to improve student performance, conflict resolution, and relationships among students. Such professional learning opportunities shall be evaluated based on criteria specified in Education Code 44277 and BP 4131 - Staff Development.

The district's staff evaluation process may be used to recommend additional individualized staff development for individual employees.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide a means for continual evaluation of the benefit of staff development activities to staff and students and shall regularly report to the Board regarding the effectiveness of the staff development program.
