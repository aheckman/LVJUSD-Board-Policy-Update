## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide opportunities for eligible District students to enroll concurrently in courses offered at postsecondary institutions in order to foster individual student achievement, increase opportunities for students to complete college preparatory course requirements and/or participate in career technical education (CTE), and prepare students for a smooth transition into college by providing exposure to the collegiate environment.

When it is determined that the postsecondary course in which the student intends to enroll is substantially equivalent to a course provided by the District, the student may receive credit toward high school graduation requirements in addition to credit received from the college.

Approval of Concurrent Enrollment

The Board may approve a limited number of students of any age or grade level to apply for part-time or full-time concurrent enrollment in a community college or four-year college when it is determined to be in the student's best interest and the student is adequately prepared for such coursework.

Upon recommendation of the principal and with parent/guardian consent, the Board may authorize a student to attend a community college during any session or term as a special part-time or full-time student and to undertake one or more courses of instruction offered at the community college level. (Education Code 48800)

Within the enrollment limits and exceptions allowed by law, the principal may recommend a student for community college summer session if that student demonstrates adequate preparation in the discipline to be studied and exhausts all opportunities to enroll in an equivalent course, if any, at the school of attendance. (Education Code 48800)

A student's parent/guardian, regardless of the student's age or grade level, may petition the Board to authorize special full-time attendance at a community college on the ground that the student would benefit from advanced scholastic or career technical work that would be available. If the petition is denied, an appeal may be filed with the County Board of Education. (Education Code 48800.5)

If the Board denies a request for special part-time or full-time enrollment at a community college for a student who is identified as highly gifted and talented, the Board shall issue its written recommendation and the reasons for the denial at its next regularly scheduled Board meeting that falls at least 30 days, but within 60 days, after the request has been submitted. (Education Code 48800, 48800.5)

The Board may authorize a student who is pursuing a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate through an adult education program, upon recommendation of the administrator of the student's adult school, to attend a community college during any session or term as a special part-time student. (Education Code 52620)

College and Career Access Pathways Partnerships

The Board may enter into a College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) partnership agreement with the board of a community college district for the purpose of offering or expanding dual enrollment opportunities for students. The agreement shall be approved at an open public Board meeting, with an opportunity for public input provided prior to the Board taking action. If the CCAP agreement provides for CTE pathways, the Board shall consult with and consider input from appropriate local workforce board(s) to determine the extent to which the pathways are aligned with regional and statewide employment needs. (Education Code 76004)

Program Evaluation

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board regarding the number and demographics of District students participating in the concurrent enrollment option, their success in completing college preparatory courses ("a-g" courses) and postsecondary courses, and any impact on their achievement in District courses and graduation rates.
