## Policy Content

Definition

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49073 and 20 USC 1232g, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), mandate that school districts adopt a policy identifying those categories of student records considered to be "directory information," which may generally be released unless the parent/guardian notifies the district of his/her refusal. "Directory information" is defined in Education Code 49061 and 34 CFR 99.3 and listed in the following section. The district may not expand the list, but may modify it to remove any items the district does not intend to release as directory information. Also see AR 5125 - Student Records.Education Code 49061 does not include three types of information defined as directory information in 34 CFR 99.3: the student's place of birth, grade level, and photograph. Thus, these types of information are not reflected in the following list. Districts that receive any request for such information about student(s) based on federal law should consult legal counsel prior to releasing the information.
Directory information means information contained in a student record that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Such student information includes:  (Education Code 49061; 20 USC 1232g; 34 CFR 99.3)

	Name
	 
	Address
	 
	Telephone number
	 
	Email address
	 
	Date of birth
	 
	Major field of study
	 
	Participation record in officially recognized activities and sports
	 
	Weight and height of athletic team members
	 
	Dates of attendance
	 
	Degrees and awards received
	 
	Most recent previous school attended

Directory information does not include a student's social security number or student identification number. However, for purposes of accessing or communicating in electronic systems, directory information may include a student identification number, user identification, or other personal identifier used by the student provided that the identifier cannot be used to gain access to education records except when used in conjunction with a personal identification number, password, or other factor known or possessed only by the authorized user.  (34 CFR 99.3)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph reflects a model policy developed by the California Attorney General pursuant to Education Code 234.7, as added by AB 699 (Ch. 493, Statutes of 2017). See the Office of the Attorney General's Promoting a Safe and Secure Learning Environment for All: Guidance and Model Policies to Assist California's K-12 Schools in Responding to Immigration Issues. Also see the section "Notification to Parents/Guardians" below.
Directory information also does not include a student's citizenship status, immigration status, place of birth, or any other information indicating national origin.

Notification to Parents/Guardians

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49063 and 20 USC 1232g, the district must annually notify parents/guardians and students who are age 18 or older, in writing, of the categories of records considered to be "directory information." The Attorney General's model policy developed pursuant to Education Code 234.7 requires that this notification also describe the manner in which parents/guardians may refuse the release of directory information. See the accompanying Exhibit for a sample parent/guardian notification.
At the beginning of each school year, all parents/guardians shall be notified as to the categories of directory information the district plans to release and the recipients of the information. The notification shall also inform parents/guardians of their right to refuse to let the district designate any or all types of information as directory information, how to refuse release, and the period of time within which a parent/guardian must notify the district in writing that he/she does not want a certain category of information designated as directory information.  (Education Code 49063, 49073; 20 USC 1232g; 34 CFR 99.37)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 234.7, districts are mandated to adopt the following paragraph consistent with the Attorney General's model policy.
In addition, the annual parental notification shall include a statement that directory information does not include citizenship status, immigration status, place of birth, or any other information indicating national origin and that the district will not release such information without parental consent or a court order.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph applies to districts that maintain secondary schools and receive funds under the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). 20 USC 7908 requires those districts to notify parents/guardians that they may request that the district not release their child's name, address, and telephone number to military recruiters, employers, or colleges without their prior written consent. According to Guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) (Access to High School Students and Information on Students by Military Recruiters), a single notice provided through a mailing, student handbook, or other method that is reasonably calculated to inform parents/guardians of the above information is sufficient. The law does not specify whether parents/guardians may request that the district not release their child's information to certain third parties, such as military recruiters, but authorize the release to other parties, such as private employers. Districts should consult legal counsel as appropriate.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians that they may request that the district not release the name, address, and telephone number of their child to military recruiters, employers, or institutions of higher education without prior written consent.  (20 USC 7908)

Parent/Guardian Consent

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49073 specifies that parents/guardians may request that their child's directory information not be released (an "opt-out" process). Similarly, 20 USC 7908 requires an "opt-out" process by which parents/guardians may request that their child's information not be released to military recruiters, employers, or institutions of higher education. However, in the case of a homeless student as defined in 42 USC 11434a, directory information may only be released if the parent/guardian or student age 18 or older has provided written consent for its release ("opt-in process").
No directory information of a student identified as a homeless child or youth as defined in 42 USC 11434a shall be released, unless the parent/guardian, or the student if he/she is 18 years or older, has provided written consent that directory information may be released. For any other student, directory information shall not be released if his/her parent/guardian notifies the district in writing that such information not be disclosed without the parent/guardian's prior consent.  (Education Code 49073; 20 USC 1232g, 7908)

For a former student, the district shall continue to honor any valid request to opt out of the disclosure of directory information made while the student was in attendance at the district, unless the opt-out request has been rescinded.  (34 CFR 99.37)

However, in the case of a homeless student as defined in 42 USC 11434a, directory information may only be released if the parent/guardian or student age 18 or older has provided written consent for its release ("opt-in process").</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MOTYNg5" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MOTYNg5%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22YNA677%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1573242611%2C%22text%22%3A%22Education%20Code%2049073%20specifies%20that%20parents/guardians%20may%20request%20that%20their%20child%27s%20directory%20information%20not%20be%20released%20%28an%20%5C%22opt-out%5C%22%20process%29.%20Similarly%2C%2020%20USC%207908%20requires%20an%20%5C%22opt-out%5C%22%20process%20by%20which%20parents/guardians%20may%20request%20that%20their%20child%27s%20information%20not%20be%20released%20to%20military%20recruiters%2C%20employers%2C%20or%20institutions%20of%20higher%20education.%20However%2C%20in%20the%20case%20of%20a%20homeless%20student%20as%20defined%20in%2042%20USC%2011434a%2C%20directory%20information%20may%20only%20be%20released%20if%20the%20parent/guardian%20or%20student%20age%2018%20or%20older%20has%20provided%20written%20consent%20for%20its%20release%20%28%5C%22opt-in%20process%5C%22%29.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MOTYNg5" title="CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49073 specifies that par..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
