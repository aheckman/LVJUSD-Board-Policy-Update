## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the impact that civility has on the effective operation of the District, including its role in creating a safe and positive school climate and enabling a focus on student well-being, learning, and achievement.

The Board believes that each person should be treated with dignity and respect in their interactions within the school community. The Board understands that the First Amendment provides strong protection for speech. The Board expects that all speech and expression will comport with norms of civil behavior on District grounds, in District facilities, during District activities or events, and in the use of District electronic/digital systems and platforms.

Civil behavior is polite, courteous, and reasonable behavior which is respectful to others and includes integrity, honesty, acceptance, timeliness, dependability, observance of laws and rules, and effective communication.

The Board and District staff shall model civil behavior as an example of behavior that is expected throughout the District. Practices that promote civil behavior include actively listening, giving full attention to the speaker, and refraining from interruptions; welcoming and encouraging participation, input, and feedback through stakeholder engagement; promptly responding to concerns; and embracing varying and diverse viewpoints. Such practices may be incorporated into governance standards adopted by the Board or Superintendent and/or professional standards or codes of conduct for employees as specified in District policies and regulations.

Students, staff, parents/guardians, and community members should be educated in the recognition, development, and demonstration of civil behavior. The Superintendent or designee may incorporate related concepts in the curriculum, provide staff development activities, and/or communicate this policy to the school community.

Students, staff, parents/guardians, and community members shall not communicate or behave in a manner that causes disruption; hinders the orderly conduct of District operations, the educational program, or any other District program or activity; or creates an unsafe learning or working environment. The Superintendent or designee may respond to disruptive, violent, or threatening behavior in accordance with law and as specified in BP/AR 3515.2 - Disruptions.

Behavior by students or staff that is discriminatory, harassing, or intimidating, including sexual harassment, bullying, and/or hate violence, or behavior that is in any other way unlawful, is prohibited and is subject to discipline in accordance with law and as specified in District policy and regulations.
