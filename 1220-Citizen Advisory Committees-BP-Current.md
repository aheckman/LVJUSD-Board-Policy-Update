## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Government Code 54952 and Education Code 35147, certain committees may be subject to open meeting law requirements. See the accompanying administrative regulation and BB 9130 - Board Committees. 
The Governing Board recognizes that citizen advisory committees enable the Board to better understand the interests and concerns of the community. 

The Board shall establish citizen advisory committees when required by law, to strengthen the effectiveness of district and school operations, or to enhance student learning. The purpose of any such committees shall be clearly defined and aligned to the district's vision, mission, and goals.  The Board may dissolve any advisory committee not required by law when the committee has fulfilled its duties or at any time the Board deems it necessary.

The Superintendent or designee may establish advisory committees which shall report to him/her in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.

Citizen advisory committees shall serve in an advisory capacity; they may make recommendations, but their actions shall not be binding on the Board or Superintendent.

The membership of citizen advisory committees should reflect the diversity of the community and represent a diversity of viewpoints.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training and information, as necessary, to enable committee members to understand the goals of the committee and to fulfill their role as committee members.

Within budget allocations, the Superintendent or designee may approve requests for committee travel and may reimburse committee members for expenses at the same rates and under the same conditions as those provided for district employees.
