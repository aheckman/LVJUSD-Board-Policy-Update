## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy and administrative regulation address the sale and disposal of district-owned personal property, such as instructional materials, equipment, and supplies. For policy on the sale or lease of surplus real property, see BP 3280 - Sale or Lease of District-Owned Real Property.
The Governing Board recognizes its fiscal responsibility to maximize the use of district equipment, supplies, instructional materials, and other personal property while providing up-to-date resources that facilitate student learning and effective district operations. When the Board, upon recommendation of the Superintendent or designee, declares any district-owned personal property unusable, obsolete, or no longer needed, the Board shall determine the estimated value of the property and shall decide whether the property will be donated, sold, or otherwise disposed of as prescribed by law and administrative regulation.

The Board shall approve the price and terms of any sale or lease of personal property of the district.

If the Board members who are in attendance at a meeting unanimously agree that the property, whether one or more items, does not exceed $2,500 in value, the property may be sold without advertising for bids.  (Education Code 17546)

If the Board members who are in attendance at a meeting unanimously find that the value of the property is insufficient to defray the costs of arranging a sale, the property may be donated to a charitable organization deemed appropriate by the Board or may be disposed of in the local public dump.  (Education Code 17546)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 60510-60530 establish conditions for the sale or disposal of obsolete instructional materials depending on whether such materials are usable or unusable for educational purposes; see the section "Instructional Materials" in the accompanying administrative regulation. The following optional paragraph prescribes criteria for determining when instructional materials are obsolete or unusable, and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Instructional materials shall be considered obsolete or unusable by the district if they have been replaced by more recent editions or new materials selected by the Board, are not aligned with the district's academic standards or course of study, and have no foreseeable value in other instructional areas. Such materials may be sold or donated if they continue to serve educational purposes that would benefit others outside the district. Instructional materials are not appropriate for sale or donation if they meet any of the following criteria:

	Contain information rendered inaccurate or incomplete by new research or technologies
	 
	Contain demeaning, stereotyping, or patronizing references to any group of persons protected against discrimination by law or Board policy
	 
	Are damaged beyond use or repair

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.313, equipment or supplies acquired under a federal grant or subgrant may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of, with no further obligation to the awarding federal agency, when they are no longer needed for the original project or program or for other federally supported activities. However, when the current per-unit fair market value of the equipment or the residual inventory of the unused supplies is $5,000 or more, the federal agency that provided the grant or subgrant shall be entitled to a share of the current market value of the equipment, if retained, or the proceeds from its sale, and to compensation for its share of the unused supplies. See the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures to be used whenever the district sells equipment or supplies originally acquired under a federal grant or subgrant. Such procedures shall be designed to ensure the highest possible return.  (2 CFR 200.313)
