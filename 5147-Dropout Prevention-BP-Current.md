## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be modified to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board expects all students to remain in school until graduation in order to acquire critical knowledge and skills and be prepared for postsecondary education and/or employment. The Superintendent or designee shall identify factors that impede student success in school and shall implement integrated, systemic support and strategies that address dropout prevention and promote timely intervention and recovery.

CSBA NOTE: The California Department of Education (CDE) has identified strategies that have a positive effect in encouraging students to regularly attend school, which can be found on CDE's webpage, "School Attendance Improvement Strategies." Some of these practices include identifying and responding to grade level and student subgroup patterns of chronic absence and truancy; improving communication with parents/guardians, including using bilingual aides and sending out attendance emails in the language used by parents/guardians; positive reinforcement for improved attendance such as prizes for individuals or classes with the most improved attendance; and personalizing relationships between students and school support staff and/or teachers, including establishing homeroom classes for secondary students for all years of high school.
The Superintendent or designee, in collaboration with parents/guardians, school staff, and community agencies and organizations as appropriate, shall develop districtwide and schoolwide strategies that support regular school attendance for all students. Dropout prevention strategies shall include efforts to provide a safe and positive learning environment that engages and motivates students, encourages students' connectedness to the schools, offers meaningful educational opportunities, and promotes student health and well-being.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46211, as added by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), a district may, beginning July 1, 2025, implement attendance recovery programs for students in grades TK-12 to make up lost instructional time and offset absences, including chronic absenteeism for up to 10 days of attendance in a school year or the number of absences a student accrued in that school year, whichever is less. A student's participation in an attendance recovery program is optional and may not be punitive. Attendance recovery programs may be operated before or after school, on weekends, or during intersessional periods. A district that operates attendance recovery programs must offer access to the programs throughout the school year, including at least once during each term, such as a trimester or quarter.Students participating in an attendance recovery program may generate average daily attendance (ADA) for the school year in which the program is operated, and that otherwise meets the requirements of Education Code 46211. Districts are required to report ADA accrued through participation in an attendance recovery program to CDE separately from ADA generated during the school day in classroom-based programs. It is recommended that districts with questions about attendance recovery programs consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district counsel.
In order to make up lost instructional time and offset absences, the district may implement attendance recovery programs. Any attendance recovery program shall be provided as a voluntary, limited-term option for a classroom-based, regular education program for students in grades TK-12 in accordance with Education Code 46211.

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies to provide targeted support to individual students who are at risk of dropping out of school. Students may be identified based on indicators such as chronic absenteeism, truancy, or tardiness; below-grade-level academic achievement as evidenced by student assessment results and/or teacher evaluations; and personal, social, health, or economic circumstances that may affect student performance and behavior in school.

Strategies to support students at risk of dropping out of school may include, but are not limited to:

	Meetings and/or home visits with the student and parent/guardian to identify and address barriers to the student's success and inform them of the state's compulsory education law
	 
	Individualized instruction that responds to the needs and unique learning styles of students
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46211, as added by SB 153, a district may implement attendance recovery programs for students to make up lost instructional time and offset absences, including chronic absenteeism.
	Supplemental instruction during or outside the school day that is designed to help students overcome academic deficiencies, including attendance recovery programs
	 
	Enrollment in alternative or specialized educational programs
	 
	Assistance locating employment or work-based learning opportunities which link classroom learning with real-world experiences
	 
	Academic guidance and personal counseling services
	 
	Referral to a student success team, school attendance review board, or other team that addresses persistent attendance problems
	
	CSBA NOTE: A student assistance program (SAP) is an integrated effort to intervene with students for non-academic barriers to learning by connecting education, programs, and school and community services to create a network of supports for students through referral and facilitation of appropriate services. Non-academic barriers to learning include substance abuse; mental health issues including depression or suicidal thoughts or behavior, self-injury, stress and anxiety, or grief; emotional or social issues; school adjustment problems; trauma generated at school or home; attendance and dropout problems; physical and sexual abuse, or violence; gender issues; teen pregnancy and parenting; family issues, including dissolution, homelessness or displacement, family member mental health and substance use disorders, and relationship difficulties; parent or other family member incarceration; military deployment; or delinquency and involvement with the juvenile justice system. CDE's publication, "SAP Bulletin 11: Nine Components of SAPs," provides for recommended minimum requirements needed to reduce barriers to learning and ensure student success, including a board policy defining the school's role in creating a safe, disciplined, and drug-free learning community; staff development; program awareness; an internal referral process; a problem solving team and case management; SAP evaluation; educational student support groups; cooperation and collaboration with community agencies and resources; and integration with other school-based programs.For resources related to the implementation of SAPs, see CDE's, "Student Assistance Programs" and "School Attendance Improvement Strategies" webpages.
	Referral to school and/or community support services, such as a student assistance program; substance abuse program; health services or school nurse; school social worker or social services; school counselor, school psychologist or other student support personnel for case management and counseling; and other resources
	 
	Continued monitoring of student attendance, including tracking student attendance and identifying students with attendance problems as early as possible, so the school may provide appropriate support services and interventions
	 
	Employment of qualified outreach consultants to perform duties related to dropout identification, prevention, intervention, and recovery as assigned
	
	CSBA NOTE: Items #11-12 reflect recommendations from the Institute of Education Sciences' publication, "Preventing Dropout in Secondary Schools," to create small communities to facilitate monitoring and support, and to engage students by offering programs that connect schoolwork with college and career success and that improve students' capacity to manage challenges in and out of school.
	Creating small, personalized learning communities to facilitate monitoring and support
	 
	Offering courses or programs that connect schoolwork with college and career success, including career technical education

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060 requires districts to develop a local control and accountability plan (LCAP) which includes goals and actions aligned with specified state priorities, including student engagement; see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control And Accountability Plan. Pursuant to Education Code 52060, student engagement should be measured by school attendance rates, chronic absenteeism rates, middle school dropout rates, high school dropout rates, high school graduation rates, as applicable, and any additional metrics developed and selected by the district. Actions identified to address other state priorities, such as school climate and student achievement, may also contribute to dropout prevention.
The strategies may be incorporated into the district's local control and accountability plan and linked to district goals for student engagement, school climate, and student achievement.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that employees are trained to support at-risk students and are prepared to implement intervention strategies or to make appropriate referrals to support services.

When a student leaves school prior to the end of a school year, or when a student successfully completed the prior school year but did not begin attending the next grade or school that the student was expected to attend or had pre-registered to attend, the Superintendent or designee shall make efforts to determine whether the student has dropped out or has transferred to another educational setting. The Superintendent or designee may contact the student's parents/guardians to verify school enrollment and, if necessary, shall implement intervention and recovery efforts.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6311, a district that receives Title I Funds is required to include high school graduation rates, including a four-year adjusted cohort graduate rate, on its annual report card. CDE monitors district programs and operations for compliance with these requirements through its Federal Program Monitoring (FPM) process. The FPM process includes a review of a district's written policies and procedures to maintain required documentation for students who transfer or withdraw from a district school, including the exit reasons and documentation to support the exit reasons. The following paragraph reflects the Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate 2024-25 FPM instrument.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain required documentation for students who transfer from or otherwise withdraw from a school in the district.  (20 USC 6311)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph reflects indicators specified in Education Code 52060, as measures of student engagement for purposes of the LCAP, and may be revised to reflect district practice and the grade levels offered by the district.Using data submitted by districts through the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CalPADS), CDE calculates four-year graduation and dropout rates for districts, schools, and counties.Pursuant to Education Code 60900.2, as added by AB 1340 (Ch. 576, Statutes of 2023), and contingent upon an appropriation, CDE is required to post a report on its website that allows the public to view statewide-level four- and five-year cohort graduation rates for students with disabilities, disaggregated by disability.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board on measures of student engagement, including school attendance rates, chronic absenteeism rates, middle school and high school dropout rates, and high school graduation rates. The Board shall monitor district progress in increasing student retention in school and may require revisions in district plans and strategies as needed.

CDE's publication, "SAP Bulletin 11: Nine Components of SAPs," provides for recommended minimum requirements needed to reduce barriers to learning and ensure student success, including a board policy defining the school's role in creating a safe, disciplined, and drug-free learning community; staff development; program awareness; an internal referral process; a problem solving team and case management; SAP evaluation; educational student support groups; cooperation and collaboration with community agencies and resources; and integration with other school-based programs.<br><br>For resources related to the implementation of SAPs, see CDE's, "Student Assistance Programs" and "School Attendance Improvement Strategies" webpages.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="NTExMQ4" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22NTExMQ4%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22yNQ231%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1726003330%2C%22text%22%3A%22A%20student%20assistance%20program%20%28SAP%29%20is%20an%20integrated%20effort%20to%20intervene%20with%20students%20for%20non-academic%20barriers%20to%20learning%20by%20connecting%20education%2C%20programs%2C%20and%20school%20and%20community%20services%20to%20create%20a%20network%20of%20supports%20for%20students%20through%20referral%20and%20facilitation%20of%20appropriate%20services.%20Non-academic%20barriers%20to%20learning%20include%20substance%20abuse%3B%20mental%20health%20issues%20including%20depression%20or%20suicidal%20thoughts%20or%20behavior%2C%20self-injury%2C%20stress%20and%20anxiety%2C%20or%20grief%3B%20emotional%20or%20social%20issues%3B%20school%20adjustment%20problems%3B%20trauma%20generated%20at%20school%20or%20home%3B%20attendance%20and%20dropout%20problems%3B%20physical%20and%20sexual%20abuse%2C%20or%20violence%3B%20gender%20issues%3B%20teen%20pregnancy%20and%20parenting%3B%20family%20issues%2C%20including%20dissolution%2C%20homelessness%20or%20displacement%2C%20family%20member%20mental%20health%20and%20substance%20use%20disorders%2C%20and%20relationship%20difficulties%3B%20parent%20or%20other%20family%20member%20incarceration%3B%20military%20deployment%3B%20or%20delinquency%20and%20involvement%20with%20the%20juvenile%20justice%20system.%20CDE%27s%20publication%2C%20%5C%22SAP%20Bulletin%2011%3A%20Nine%20Components%20of%20SAPs%2C%5C%22%20provides%20for%20recommended%20minimum%20requirements%20needed%20to%20reduce%20barriers%20to%20learning%20and%20ensure%20student%20success%2C%20including%20a%20board%20policy%20defining%20the%20school%27s%20role%20in%20creating%20a%20safe%2C%20disciplined%2C%20and%20drug-free%20learning%20community%3B%20staff%20development%3B%20program%20awareness%3B%20an%20internal%20referral%20process%3B%20a%20problem%20solving%20team%20and%20case%20management%3B%20SAP%20evaluation%3B%20educational%20student%20support%20groups%3B%20cooperation%20and%20collaboration%20with%20community%20agencies%20and%20resources%3B%20and%20integration%20with%20other%20school-based%20programs.%5Cn%5CnFor%20resources%20related%20to%20the%20implementation%20of%20SAPs%2C%20see%20CDE%27s%2C%20%5C%22Student%20Assistance%20Programs%5C%22%20and%20%5C%22School%20Attendance%20Improvement%20Strategies%5C%22%20webpages.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-NTExMQ4" title="CSBA NOTE: A student assistance program (SAP) is a..."></annotation></li>
