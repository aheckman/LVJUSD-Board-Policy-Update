## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy may be revised to reflect district practice. State and federal law establish requirements for the identification, placement, and education of English learners.Pursuant to Education Code 42238.02 and 42238.03, the local control funding formula provides additional funding based on the number and concentration of unduplicated counts of students who are English learners, foster youth, and/or eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Such funds must be used to increase or improve services for unduplicated students at least in proportion to the increase in funds apportioned on the basis of the number or concentration of unduplicated students; see BP 3100 - Budget.In addition, 20 USC 6801-7014 (Title III) provide grant funds that may be used to supplement, but not supplant, funding from other sources for the purpose of ensuring that English learners attain English proficiency and meet the same challenging academic standards that are applicable to all students. During the Federal Program Monitoring (FPM) process, California Department of Education (CDE) staff will expect to see evidence that the district has complied with state and federal requirements. See CDE's website for FPM compliance monitoring instruments.For further information regarding English learners, programs, and services, see CDE's, "The California English Learner Roadmap: Strengthening Comprehensive Educational Policies, Programs and Practices for English Learners," (Roadmap) available on its website.Pursuant to Education Code 361, as added by AB 2074 (Ch. 946, Statutes of 2024), CDE is required to develop a statewide implementation plan for the, "EL Roadmap Policy," which includes clear and measurable statewide goals of implementation, alignment with other state initiatives, guidance for districts, and a system for monitoring implementation of the plan.
The Governing Board intends to provide English learners with challenging curriculum and instruction that maximize the attainment of high levels of proficiency in English, advance multilingual capabilities, and facilitate student achievement in the district's regular course of study.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 60811, the State Board of Education (SBE) adopted state academic content standards for English language development (ELD), and the English Language Arts/English Language Development Framework aligned with the California Common Core State Standards for English language arts, for students whose primary language is a language other than English. A supplementary resource, "Integrating the CA ELD Standards into K-12 Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning," specifies the correspondence of the state ELD standards to the California Common Core State Standards for mathematics and the Next Generation Science Standards.CDE's, "California Digital Learning Integration and Standards Guidance," available on its website, provides distance learning curriculum and instructional guidance for mathematics, English language arts, and English language development.Additionally, CDE's, "Roadmap" encourages differentiated instruction and curriculum which are integrated across all subject areas and emphasizes inquiry-based learning and critical thinking skills.
English learners shall be provided differentiated English language development instruction which is targeted to their English proficiency level. Such instruction shall be based on sound instructional theory, be aligned with state content standards, emphasize inquiry-based learning and critical thinking skills, and be integrated across all subject areas.

CSBA NOTE: The following items are for use by districts that maintain middle and/or high schools and may be revised to reflect the grade levels offered by the district. Education Code 60811.8 prohibits districts from denying any student who is an English learner the opportunity to enroll in core curriculum courses, courses required for middle school promotion or high school graduation, courses required for college admission, or advanced courses, with specified exceptions for recently arrived immigrant children and youth as defined in 20 USC 7011. Pursuant to Education Code 60811.8, as amended by AB 714 (Ch. 342, Statutes of 2023), "newcomer student" has the same meaning as "immigrant children and youth." However, Education Code 60811.8 does not require districts to create supplemental courses in languages other than English.
No middle or high school student who is an English learner shall be denied enrollment in any of the following:  (Education Code 60811.8)


	Courses in the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science, and history/social science, courses required to meet state and local high school graduation requirements, or courses required for middle school grade promotion
	
	However, a middle or high school student who is a newcomer student or an immigrant child or youth, as defined in 20 USC 7011, or is a student participating in a program designed to meet the academic and transitional needs of newcomer students and that has as its primary objective the development of English language proficiency, may be denied enrollment in any of the courses stated above if the course of study provided to the student is designed to remedy academic deficits incurred during participation and is reasonably calculated to enable the student to attain parity of participation in the standard instructional program within a reasonable length of time after the student enters the school system.
	 
	A full course load of courses specified in Item #1 above
	 
	Other courses that meet the "A-G" course requirements for college admission or are advanced courses such as honors or Advanced Placement courses, on the sole basis of the student's classification as an English learner

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060 requires the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) to include annual goals and specific actions, aligned to state and local priorities, for all students and for each "numerically significant" student subgroup as defined in Education Code 52052, including English learners; see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan. CDE's, "Roadmap" provides an alignment between principles outlined for English learners and the eight state priority areas required in the district's LCAP.Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), has been expanded to include long-term English learners as a numerically significant subgroup, separate from English learners. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), a "long-term English learner" is defined as a student who has not attained English language proficiency within seven years of initial classification as an English learner.
The district shall identify in its local control and accountability plan (LCAP) goals and specific actions and services to enhance student engagement, academic achievement, and other outcomes for English learners and long-term English learners, in accordance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district strategies for parent/guardian and community involvement. Education Code 305 requires the district to solicit input on language acquisition programs as part of the parent/guardian and community engagement process during the development of the LCAP; see "Language Acquisition Programs" below. In addition, if district enrollment includes at least 15 percent English learners, with at least 50 students who are English learners, Education Code 52063 requires the establishment of an English Learner Parent Advisory Committee to review and comment on the district's LCAP; see the accompanying administrative regulation and BP 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.
The Superintendent or designee shall encourage parent/guardian and community involvement in the development and evaluation of programs for English learners. The Superintendent or designee may also provide an English development literacy training program for parents/guardians and community members so that they may better support students' English language development.

Staff Qualifications and Training

CSBA NOTE: Commission on Teacher Credentialing's (CTC) leaflet CL-622, "Serving English Learners," and "Bilingual Authorization Educator Preparation Preconditions, Program Standards, and Bilingual Teaching Performance Expectations," describe requirements pertaining to the qualifications of teachers of English learners. A teacher who is assigned to provide English language development, specially designed academic instruction in English, and/or primary language instruction to English learners must hold an appropriate authorization from CTC; see AR 4112.22 - Staff Teaching English Learners.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all staff employed to teach English learners possess the appropriate authorization from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph reflects a requirement for districts that receive federal Title III funds to improve the education of English learners and is recommended for use by all districts. 20 USC 6825 lists the required uses of such funds, including the provision of professional development of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on teachers' performance in the classroom. Pursuant to 20 USC 6825, such professional development must not include one-day or short-term workshops and conferences.
The district shall provide effective professional development to teachers (including teachers in classroom settings that are not the settings of language instruction educational programs), administrators, and other school or community-based organization personnel to improve the instruction and assessment of English learners and enhance staff's ability to understand and use curricula, assessment, and instructional strategies for English learners. Such professional development shall be of sufficient intensity and duration to produce a positive and lasting impact on teachers' performance in the classroom.  (20 USC 6825)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. CDE's, "Roadmap," indicates the importance of a supportive and collaborative environment in order for teachers to effectively address the complex needs of English learners.
Staff development shall also address the sociocultural needs of English learners and provide opportunities for teachers to engage in supportive, collaborative learning communities.

Identification and Assessment

CSBA NOTE: CDE's, "Roadmap," emphasizes the importance of early identification of English learners, as early childhood is a crucial period of time for language development. Education Code 313 requires any district that has one or more students who are English learners to assess the English language proficiency of those students using the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC).However, pursuant to Education Code 313, as amended by AB 2268 (Ch. 15, Statutes of 2024), students in transitional kindergarten (TK) are exempted from this assessment requirement. CDE's, "Interim Guidance on Transitional Kindergarten Students and English Language Proficiency Testing," provides that districts should continue to conduct the Home Language Survey during TK enrollment to identify whether the primary or native language of a student is a language other than English. Since there may be implications with other state and federal laws, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel, as necessary.The ELPAC includes an initial test for identifying students who may be English learners and an annual summative assessment for determining English learners' level of English proficiency and progress in acquiring the skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English. CDE also provides a home language survey to be used to identify students who should be tested for English proficiency. See the accompanying administrative regulation for further information about test administration, identification of English learners, and reclassification criteria.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain procedures for the early identification and assessment of the proficiency of English learners at all grade levels, except transitional kindergarten, using the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC). To oversee test administration, the Superintendent or designee shall annually designate a district ELPAC coordinator and a site coordinator for each test site in accordance with 5 CCR 11518.40-11518.45.

Once identified as an English learner, a student shall be annually assessed for language proficiency until the student is reclassified based on criteria specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.

CSBA NOTE: In addition to testing the level of English proficiency of English learners, districts are required, pursuant to Education Code 60640, to administer the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) to English learners; see BP/AR 6162.51 - State Academic Achievement Tests. As needed, English learners may be provided with testing resources, such as universal tools, designated supports, and accommodations, specified in 5 CCR 853 during test administration.CAASPP also includes the optional California Spanish Assessment for students in grades 3-8 and high school, which measures a student's competency in reading, writing, and listening in Spanish.Pursuant to Education Code 60900.1, CDE is required to annually post on its website CAASPP test results by English language acquisition status and to report enrollment data by English language acquisition status and disability.
In addition, English learners' academic achievement in English language arts, mathematics, science, and any additional subject required by law shall be assessed using the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress. As necessary, the test shall be administered with testing variations in accordance with 5 CCR 853. English learners who are in their first 12 months of attending a school in the United States shall be exempted from taking the English language arts assessment to the extent allowed by federal law.  (Education Code 60603, 60640; 5 CCR 853)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. CDE's, "Roadmap," highlights the importance of formative assessments in order to continually adapt methodologies and instruction to meet the needs of English learners.
Formative assessments may be utilized to analyze student performance and appropriately adapt teaching methodologies and instructions.

Language Acquisition Programs

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 305-310 authorizes parents/guardians to select a language acquisition program that best suits their child. At a minimum, the district must offer a structured English immersion program. It also may offer a dual-language immersion program, transitional and developmental program for English learners, or other language acquisition program as defined in Education Code 306. Pursuant to 20 USC 6312 and 34 CFR 100.3, parents/guardians have a right to decline or opt their child out of a language acquisition program. The following section may be revised to reflect programs offered by the district. Also see the accompanying administrative regulation.
The district shall offer research-based language acquisition programs that are designed to ensure English acquisition as rapidly and as effectively as possible and that provide instruction to students on the state-adopted academic content standards, including the English language development standards.  (Education Code 306; 5 CCR 11300)

At a minimum, the district shall offer a structured English immersion program which includes designated and integrated English language development. In the structured English immersion program, nearly all of the classroom instruction shall be provided in English, but with the curriculum and presentation designed for students who are learning English.  (Education Code 305-306; 5 CCR 11309)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. The Education Code does not define the term "nearly all" for purposes of ensuring that nearly all instruction in the structured English immersion program is provided in English pursuant to Education Code 306. The following paragraph defines "nearly all" as to provide that all classroom instruction be conducted in English except for clarification, explanation, and support as needed. The district could instead establish a minimum percentage of classroom instructional time to be conducted in English or specify the types of courses to be conducted in English and the courses (e.g., science, algebra) to be taught in the student's primary language.
For the purpose of determining the amount of instruction to be conducted in English in the structured English immersion program, "nearly all" means that all classroom instruction shall be conducted in English except for clarification, explanation, and support as needed.

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-2 below are optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
In addition, language acquisition programs offered by the district may include, but are not limited to, the following:  (Education Code 305-306)

	A dual-language immersion program that provides integrated language learning and academic instruction for native speakers of English and native speakers of another language, with the goals of high academic achievement, first and second language proficiency, and cross-cultural understanding
	 
	A transitional or developmental program for English learners that provides literacy and academic instruction in English and a student's native language and that enables an English learner to achieve English proficiency and academic mastery of subject matter content and higher order thinking skills, including critical thinking, in order to meet state academic content standards

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that maintain any of grades K-3.
The district's language acquisition programs for grades K-3 shall comply with class size requirements specified in Education Code 42238.02.  (Education Code 310)

In establishing the district's language acquisition programs, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with parents/guardians and the community during the LCAP development process. The Superintendent or designee shall also consult with administrators, teachers, and other personnel with appropriate authorizations and experience in establishing a language acquisition program. (Education Code 305)

At the beginning of each school year or upon a student's enrollment, parents/guardians shall be provided information on the types of language acquisition programs available to students enrolled in the district, including, but not limited to, a description of each program, the process to be followed in making a program selection, identification of any language to be taught in addition to English when the program includes instruction in another language, and the process to request establishment of a language acquisition program.  (Education Code 310; 5 CCR 11310)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 11311, districts are required to establish a process with specified components for schools to receive and respond to requests from parents/guardians of enrolled students, and those enrolled for attendance in the next school year, to establish a language acquisition program other than, or in addition to, those already available at the school.See "Language Acquisition Programs" in the accompanying administrative regulation.
Whenever a student is identified as an English learner based on the results of the ELPAC, the student's parents/guardians may choose a language acquisition program that best suits their child. To the extent possible, any language acquisition program requested by the parents/guardians of 30 or more students at the school or by the parents/guardians of 20 or more students at any grade level shall be offered by the school.  (Education Code 310; 5 CCR 11311)

Reclassification/Redesignation

When an English learner has acquired a reasonable level of English proficiency, as determined based on state and district reclassification criteria pursuant to Education Code 52164.6, or upon the request of the parent/guardian of an English learner, the student shall be transferred from a language acquisition program into an English language mainstream classroom.

English learners shall be reclassified as fluent English proficient when they are able to comprehend, speak, read, and write English well enough to receive instruction in an English language mainstream classroom and make academic progress at a level substantially equivalent to that of students of the same age or grade whose primary language is English and who are in the regular course of study.  (Education Code 52164.6)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 313 and 52164.6, and 5 CCR 11303, require that the district's reclassification process include, at a minimum, the criteria specified in Items #1-4 below.Additionally, during the FPM process CDE will review, as mandatory evidence of program implementation and compliance, if the district has a current adopted Board policy and/or administrative regulation(s) that describes the reclassification process.SBE has approved the use of the Summative ELPAC Overall Performance Level (PL) 4 as the statewide standardized English language proficiency (ELP) criterion for reclassification. According to CDE's, "English Language Proficiency Assessments for California Information Guide," districts are required to use Overall PL 4 to determine whether a student has met the ELP assessment criterion, as reflected in Item #1 below. All other reclassification criteria, as provided in Items #2-4 below, remain locally determined.Additional guidance and resources regarding reclassification criteria are available on CDE's website. The district may expand the following list to reflect any additional criteria it has established.
The criteria for determining whether an English learner shall be reclassified as fluent English proficient shall include, but not be limited to:  (Education Code 313, 52164.6; 5 CCR 11303)

	Assessment of English language proficiency using an objective assessment instrument, including, but not limited to, the ELPAC
	
	CSBA NOTE: CDE's "Observation Protocol for Teachers of English Learners (OPTEL)," is a resource to support educators in monitoring and evaluating language use of English learner.
	Evaluation by the student's classroom teacher and any other certificated staff with direct responsibility for teaching or placement decisions related to the student, including, but not limited to, a review of the student's curriculum mastery and academic performance
	 
	Parent/guardian involvement, including:
	 
	
		Notice to parents/guardians of language reclassification and placement, including a description of the reclassification process and the parent/guardian's opportunity to participate
		 
		Encouragement of parent/guardian participation in the district's reclassification procedure, including seeking parent/guardian opinion and consultation during the reclassification process
		 
		Provision of an interpreter for the parent/guardian, when necessary
		
		CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to Education Code 313, Item #4 requires comparison of student performance on an objective assessment of basic skills that provides an empirically established range of performance of English proficient students of the same age. A letter from CDE to district superintendents, "Updated Reclassification Guidance for 2018-19," dated January 18, 2019, clarifies that the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment may be used as a local measure of the fourth criterion for grades 3-8 and 11, or districts may select another local assessment for all grade levels. CDE correspondence and resources, available on its website, provide examples of appropriate measures.
	
	
	Comparison of student performance on an objective assessment of basic skills in English against an empirically established range of performance in basic skills, based on the performance of English proficient students of the same age, which demonstrates whether the student is sufficiently proficient in English to participate effectively in a curriculum designed for students of the same age whose native language is English


The student's language proficiency assessments, the participants in the reclassification process, and any decisions regarding reclassification shall be retained in the student's permanent record.  (5 CCR 11305)

The Superintendent or designee shall monitor the progress of reclassified students to ensure their correct classification and placement.  (5 CCR 11304)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6841, districts receiving federal Title III funding are required to report to CDE the number and percentage of English learners, including English learners with a disability, meeting state academic standards for each of four years after they are no longer receiving services under Title III. During the FPM process, CDE will review whether the district monitors the progress of reclassified students for a minimum of four years to ensure correct classification and placement of reclassified students and the provision of additional academic support as needed. A letter from CDE to district superintendents, "Monitoring Reclassified Students," dated December 20, 2019, describes the areas in which districts should monitor students to ensure academic progress of former English learner students.Districts that do not receive Title III funding may revise the following paragraph to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall monitor students for at least four years following their reclassification to ensure the students have not prematurely exited, any academic deficit incurred through participation in the English learner program has been remedied, and the students are meaningfully participating in the standard instructional program compared to students who had never participated in an English learner program.  (5 CCR 11304; 20 USC 6841)

Program Evaluation

CSBA NOTE: The following section may be revised to reflect indicators agreed upon by the Governing Board and Superintendent or designee for measuring the effectiveness of the district's educational program for English learners. Education Code 52061 requires that the annual update of the LCAP include a review of progress toward the goals included in the LCAP, an assessment of the effectiveness of the specific actions described in the LCAP toward achieving the goals, and a description of changes the district will make as a result of this review and assessment.Pursuant to Education Code 313.2, CDE is required to annually determine the number of students in each district and school who are, or are at risk of becoming, long-term English learners and to report that information to districts and schools. Definitions of "long-term English learner" and "English learner at risk of becoming a long-term English learner" are contained in Education Code 313.1.The definition of "long-term English learner" in Education Code 313.1 is an English learner who is  enrolled in any of grades 6 to 12; has been enrolled in schools in the United States for six years or more; has remained at the same English language proficiency level for two or more consecutive prior years, or has regressed to a lower English language proficiency level; and a student in any of grades 6 to 9 who has scored far below basic or below basic on the prior year's English language arts standards-based achievement test administered pursuant to Education Code 60640, or a score determined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction on any successor test. This definition differs from the definition of long-term English learner pursuant to Education Code 52052 for purposes of state and local priorities set forth in the LCAP.20 USC 6311 requires the inclusion of a performance indicator on English language proficiency within the state accountability system under Title I.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the district's educational program for English learners, the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board, at least annually, regarding:

	Progress of English learners towards proficiency in English
	 
	The number and percentage of English learners reclassified as fluent English proficient
	 
	The number and percentage of English learners who are or are at risk of being classified as long-term English learners as defined in Education Code 313.1
	 
	The achievement of English learners on standards-based tests in core curricular areas
	 
	For any language acquisition program that includes instruction in a language other than English, student achievement in the non-English language in accordance with 5 CCR 11309
	 
	Progress toward any other goals identified in the district's LCAP for English learners and long-term English learners as defined in Education Code 52052
	 
	A comparison of current data with data from at least the previous year in regard to Items #1-6 above
	 
	A comparison of data between the different language acquisition programs offered by the district


The Superintendent or designee shall also provide the Board with regular reports from any district or schoolwide English learner advisory committees.

<strong>Identification and Assessment</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='wMw411' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: CDE's, "Roadmap," emphasizes the importance of early identification of English learners, as early childhood is a crucial period of time for language development. Education Code 313 requires any district that has one or more students who are English learners to assess the English language proficiency of those students using the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC).<br><br>However, pursuant to Education Code 313, as amended by AB 2268 (Ch. 15, Statutes of 2024), students in transitional kindergarten (TK) are exempted from this assessment requirement. CDE's, "Interim Guidance on Transitional Kindergarten Students and English Language Proficiency Testing," provides that districts should continue to conduct the Home Language Survey during TK enrollment to identify whether the primary or native language of a student is a language other than English. Since there may be implications with other state and federal laws, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel, as necessary.<br><br>The ELPAC includes an initial test for identifying students who may be English learners and an annual summative assessment for determining English learners' level of English proficiency and progress in acquiring the skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English. CDE also provides a home language survey to be used to identify students who should be tested for English proficiency. See the accompanying administrative regulation for further information about test administration, identification of English learners, and reclassification criteria.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="ENzANA9" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22ENzANA9%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22wMw411%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1733351066%2C%22text%22%3A%22CDE%27s%2C%20%5C%22Roadmap%2C%5C%22%20emphasizes%20the%20importance%20of%20early%20identification%20of%20English%20learners%2C%20as%20early%20childhood%20is%20a%20crucial%20period%20of%20time%20for%20language%20development.%20Education%20Code%20313%20requires%20any%20district%20that%20has%20one%20or%20more%20students%20who%20are%20English%20learners%20to%20assess%20the%20English%20language%20proficiency%20of%20those%20students%20using%20the%20English%20Language%20Proficiency%20Assessments%20for%20California%20%28ELPAC%29.%5Cn%5CnHowever%2C%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%20313%2C%20as%20amended%20by%20AB%202268%20%28Ch.%2015%2C%20Statutes%20of%202024%29%2C%20students%20in%20transitional%20kindergarten%20%28TK%29%20are%20exempted%20from%20this%20assessment%20requirement.%20CDE%27s%2C%20%5C%22Interim%20Guidance%20on%20Transitional%20Kindergarten%20Students%20and%20English%20Language%20Proficiency%20Testing%2C%5C%22%20provides%20that%20districts%20should%20continue%20to%20conduct%20the%20Home%20Language%20Survey%20during%20TK%20enrollment%20to%20identify%20whether%20the%20primary%20or%20native%20language%20of%20a%20student%20is%20a%20language%20other%20than%20English.%20Since%20there%20may%20be%20implications%20with%20other%20state%20and%20federal%20laws%2C%20it%20is%20recommended%20that%20districts%20consult%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel%2C%20as%20necessary.%5Cn%5CnThe%20ELPAC%20includes%20an%20initial%20test%20for%20identifying%20students%20who%20may%20be%20English%20learners%20and%20an%20annual%20summative%20assessment%20for%20determining%20English%20learners%27%20level%20of%20English%20proficiency%20and%20progress%20in%20acquiring%20the%20skills%20of%20listening%2C%20speaking%2C%20reading%2C%20and%20writing%20in%20English.%20CDE%20also%20provides%20a%20home%20language%20survey%20to%20be%20used%20to%20identify%20students%20who%20should%20be%20tested%20for%20English%20proficiency.%20See%20the%20accompanying%20administrative%20regulation%20for%20further%20information%20about%20test%20administration%2C%20identification%20of%20English%20learners%2C%20and%20reclassification%20criteria.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-ENzANA9" title="CSBA NOTE: CDE's, &quot;Roadmap,&quot; emphasizes the import..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
