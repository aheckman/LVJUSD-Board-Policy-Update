The Governing Board is committed to providing a safe school environment and setting expectations for appropriate student conduct. The Superintendent or designee may involve parents/guardians in student discipline as necessary to improve a student's behavior and encourage personal responsibility.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48900(k), as amended by AB 420 (Ch. 660, Statutes of 2014), prohibits a district from suspending grades K-3 students for disruption or willful defiance; see BP/AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process. However, an exception exists in Education Code 48910 allowing teachers to remove students, including a K-3 student, from class for the day of the removal and the following day for any act listed in Education Code 48900.
When removing a student from class pursuant to Education Code 48910 for committing an act of obscenity, habitual profanity or vulgarity, disruption of school activities, or willful defiance, the teacher of the class may require any parent/guardian who lives with the student to accompany the student for a portion of a school day in the class from which the student has been removed.  (Education Code 48900.1)

Any teacher requiring parental attendance pursuant to this policy shall apply the policy uniformly to all students within the classroom.  (Education Code 48900.1)

District and school-site rules for student discipline shall include procedures for implementing parental attendance requirements.   (Education Code 48900.1)
