## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48200 requires the district to provide an education to any student who resides within the district's attendance area. Education Code 48204 specifies additional circumstances under which students will be deemed to meet the residency requirements for school attendance, including, but not limited to, parent/guardian employment within district boundaries under certain conditions and interdistrict transfers; see the accompanying administrative regulation.If the Governing Board elects to authorize investigations to verify students' residency, it is mandated to adopt policy with specified components pursuant to Education Code 48204.2. See sections "Investigation of Residency" and "Appeal of Enrollment Denial" below.
The Governing Board desires to admit all students who reside within district boundaries or who fulfill the district residency requirements through other means as allowed by law. The Superintendent or designee shall develop procedures to facilitate the receipt and verification of students' proof of residency.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually notify parents/guardians of all existing attendance options available in the district, including, but not limited to, all options for meeting residency requirements for school attendance.  (Education Code 48980)

The Superintendent or designee shall require parents/guardians to provide documentation of the student's residency upon admission to a district school. A copy of the document or written statement offered as verification of residency shall be maintained in the student's mandatory permanent record.  (5 CCR 432)

CSBA NOTE: In Plyler v. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, students cannot be denied a free public education on the basis of their citizenship or immigration status, including their status as undocumented children. As discussed in a Dear Colleague Letter and fact sheet, Information on the Rights of All Children to Enroll in School, jointly issued by the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, it may be a violation of federal law for districts to adopt a policy or procedure that prohibits or discourages children from enrolling in school because they or their parents/guardians are not United States citizens or are undocumented.Consistent with this guidance, Education Code 234.7, as added by AB 699 (Ch. 493, Statutes of 2017), prohibits districts from collecting information or documents regarding citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members. See the accompanying administrative regulation and guidance provided by the California Office of the Attorney General, Promoting a Safe and Secure Learning Environment for All: Guidance and Model Policies to Assist California's K-12 Schools in Responding to Immigration Issues, available on its web site.
When establishing students' residency for enrollment purposes, the Superintendent or designee shall not inquire into the citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members.

CSBA NOTE: When a district authorizes residency status on the basis of a parent/guardian's employment within district boundaries for at least 10 hours per school week (see section "Residency Based on Parent/Guardian Employment (Allen Bill Transfers)" in the accompanying administrative regulation), Education Code 48204 encourages the district to notify the parent/guardian in writing when admission is denied and to provide reasons for the denial. The following optional paragraph provides that written notice will be provided to parents/guardians whenever enrollment is denied on any basis related to residency and may be revised to reflect district practice.
A student's enrollment may be denied when the submitted documentation is insufficient to establish district residency. In any such case, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the parent/guardian in writing, including specific reasons for the denial.

Investigation of Residency

CSBA NOTE: The following section should be revised to reflect district practice. To conduct an investigation into the residency claim of a student as authorized by Education Code 48204.1, a district is mandated pursuant to Education Code 48204.2 to adopt a policy with specified components. The policy must (1) identify the circumstances under which the district may initiate an investigation, including, at a minimum, a requirement that the district is able to identify specific, articulable facts supporting the belief that the parent/guardian has provided false or unreliable evidence of residency; (2) describe the investigatory methods that may be used, including whether the district may employ the services of a private investigator; (3) require staff to make reasonable efforts to determine whether the student resides in the district before hiring a private investigator (if allowed at all); (4) prohibit surreptitious photographing or video-recording of students who are being investigated; and (5) provide for an appeals process. The district should consult legal counsel if questions arise regarding the appropriateness of efforts to verify residency.
When the Superintendent or designee reasonably believes that a student's parent/guardian has provided false or unreliable evidence of residency, he/she may make reasonable efforts to determine that the student meets district residency requirements. An investigation may be initiated when the Superintendent or designee is able to identify specific, articulable facts supporting the belief that the parent/guardian has provided false or unreliable evidence of residency.  (Education Code 48204.1, 48204.2)

The Superintendent or designee may assign a trained district employee to conduct the investigation. The investigation may include the examination of records, including public records, and/or interviews of persons who may have knowledge of the student's residency.

If necessary, the Superintendent or designee may employ the services of a private investigator to conduct the investigation. Before hiring a private investigator, the Superintendent or designee shall make other reasonable efforts to determine whether the student resides in the district.  (Education Code 48204.2)

The investigation shall not include the surreptitious collection of photographic or videographic images of persons or places subject to the investigation. However, the use of technology is not prohibited if done in open and public view.  (Education Code 48204.2)

Any employee or contractor engaged in the investigation shall truthfully identify himself/herself as an investigator to individuals contacted or interviewed during the course of the investigation.  (Education Code 48204.2)

Appeal of Enrollment Denial

CSBA NOTE: If the district chooses to authorize investigations into the residency claim of a student as described in the section "Investigation of Residency" above, it is mandated pursuant to Education Code 48204.2 to adopt a policy which provides for an appeals process. The timelines specified in the following section may be revised to reflect district practice.
If the Superintendent or designee, upon investigation, determines that a student does not meet district residency requirements and denies the student's enrollment in the district, he/she shall provide the student's parent/guardian an opportunity to appeal that determination.  (Education Code 48204.2)

The Superintendent or designee shall send the student's parent/guardian written notice specifying the basis for the district's determination. This notice shall also inform the parent/guardian that he/she may, within 10 school days, appeal the decision and provide new evidence of residency.

The burden shall be on the parent/guardian to show why the district's determination to deny enrollment should be overruled.  (Education Code 48204.2)

A student who is currently enrolled in the district shall be allowed to remain in attendance at his/her school pending the results of the appeal. A student who is not currently enrolled in the district shall not be permitted to attend any district school unless his/her appeal is successful.

CSBA NOTE: The district may select and/or revise either of the following options to indicate who will be responsible for making the final decision regarding the student's residency claim. Option 1 is for use by districts that assign a district employee other than the Superintendent to make the initial residency determination, and provides that the Superintendent will make the final decision following the appeals process. Option 2 is for use by districts in which the Superintendent is responsible for the initial residency determination, and provides that the decision may be appealed to the Board.
OPTION 1:  In an appeal to the Superintendent of a determination that district residency requirements were not met, the Superintendent shall review any evidence provided by the parent/guardian or obtained during the district's investigation and shall make a decision within 10 school days of receipt of the parent/guardian's request for the appeal. The Superintendent's decision shall be final.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  In an appeal of the Superintendent's determination that district residency requirements were not met, the Board shall review any evidence provided by the parent/guardian or obtained during the district's investigation and shall make a decision at its next regularly scheduled meeting following the parent/guardian's request for the appeal. The Board's decision shall be final.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

Enrollment Not Requiring District Residency

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by any district maintaining grades 9-12 that (1) has petitioned for certification from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Student and Exchange Visitor Program to enroll a nonimmigrant foreign student who is in the United States on an F-1 visa and/or (2) admits high school students from other countries through an international exchange program under the sponsorship of a government-approved agency. For further information about enrollment of nonresident foreign students, see AR 5111.2 - Nonresident Foreign Students, BP/AR 6145.6 - International Exchange, and CSBA's Legal Guidance Regarding International Student Exchange Placement Organizations.
When approved by the Board and the appropriate agency, the district may enroll students from other countries who are in the United States on an F-1 visa or are participating in an international exchange program under the sponsorship of a government-approved agency.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by any district adjacent to another state or foreign country from which students may commute to the district and should be revised to reflect district circumstances. Pursuant to Education Code 48050 and 48052, any district that admits such students must be reimbursed by the parents/guardians of the students or by the district of residence for the total cost of educating the student and may not include such students in computing average daily attendance for the purpose of obtaining apportionment of state funds.
The district may enroll a nonresident student living in an adjoining state or foreign country in accordance with Education Code 48050-48052.

District residency is not required for enrollment in a regional occupational center or program if there are openings in the program or class.  (Education Code 52317)
