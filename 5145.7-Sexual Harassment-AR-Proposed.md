Definitions

Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and means sexual harassment and other harassment on the basis of one, or a combination of two or more protected characteristics, which include, but may not be limited to, sex; gender; gender identity; gender expression; sexual orientation; sex stereotypes; pregnancy, false pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or related conditions or recovery; and parental, marital, and family status.  (Education Code 200, 210.2, 220, 221.51, 230, 260; Government Code 11135; 20 USC 1681-1688)

Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, unwanted requests for sexual favors, or other unwanted verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature made against another person of the same or opposite sex in the educational setting, under any of the following conditions:  (Education Code 212.5; 5 CCR 4916)

	Submission to the conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of a student's academic status or progress
	 
	Submission to or rejection of the conduct by a student is used as the basis for academic decisions affecting the student
	 
	The conduct has the purpose or effect of having a negative impact on the student's academic performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational environment
	 
	Submission to or rejection of the conduct by the student is used as the basis for any decision affecting the student regarding benefits and services, honors, programs, or activities available at or through any District program or activity

Any prohibited conduct that occurs off campus or outside of District-related or District-sponsored programs or activities will be regarded as sexual harassment in violation of District policy if it has a continuing effect on or creates a hostile school environment for the complainant or victim of the conduct.

For purposes of applying the complaint procedures specified in Title IX, sexual harassment is defined as any of the following forms of conduct that occurs in an education program or activity in which a District school exercises substantial control over the context and respondent:  (34 CFR 106.30, 106.44)

	A District employee conditioning the provision of a District aid, benefit, or service on the student's participation in unwelcome sexual conduct
	 
	Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a student equal access to the District's education program or activity
	 
	Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking as defined in 20 USC 1092 or 34 USC 12291
