Involuntary Transfer

A decision to transfer a student involuntarily into continuation education classes shall be based on a finding that the student:  (Education Code 48432.5)

	Committed an act enumerated in Education Code 48900
	 
	Has been habitually truant or irregular in attendance from instruction the student is lawfully required to attend.

Involuntary transfer to a continuation school shall be made only when other means fail to bring about student improvement. However, a student may be involuntarily transferred the first time an act enumerated in Education Code 48900 is committed if the principal determines that the student's presence causes a danger to persons or property or threatens to disrupt the instructional process.  (Education Code 48432.5)

Prior to an involuntary transfer, the student and the student's parent/guardian, or a foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney and social worker, or an Indian child's tribal social worker, and if applicable, county social worker, shall be given written notice that a meeting may be requested with the Superintendent or designee.  (Education Code 48432.5)

At the meeting, the student and the student's parent/guardian, or, if the student is a foster youth, the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or, if the student is an Indian child, the Indian child's tribal social worker, or, if applicable, county social worker, shall be informed of the specific facts and reasons for the proposed transfer, and have the opportunity to inspect all documents relied upon, question any evidence and witnesses presented, and present evidence on the student's behalf. The student may designate one or more representatives and witnesses to be present with the student at the meeting.  (Education Code 48432.5)

A written decision to transfer, stating the facts and reasons for the decision, shall be sent to the student and the student's parent/guardian or, if the student is a foster youth, the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or, if the student is an Indian child, the Indian child's tribal social worker, or, if applicable, county social worker. It shall indicate whether the decision is subject to periodic review and the procedure for such review.  (Education Code 48432.5)

The persons making the final decision for involuntary transfer shall not be members of the staff of the school in which the student is enrolled at the time.  (Education Code 48432.5)

No involuntary transfer to a continuation school shall extend beyond the end of the semester following the semester when the acts leading to the involuntary transfer occurred.  (Education Code 48432.5)

Voluntary Enrollment

As space permits, students who meet the eligibility criteria specified in Board policy may voluntarily enroll in a continuation school. A student may be considered for placement in the continuation school whenever the student's parent/guardian submits a written request to the Superintendent or designee or the student is referred by a counselor or school administrator.

Approval of a student's voluntary transfer shall be based on a finding that the placement will promote the educational interests of the student.  (Education Code 48432.3)

Voluntary enrollment shall be subject to the following conditions:  (Education Code 48432.3, 48432.5)

	A student's voluntary placement in continuation education shall not be used as an alternative to expulsion unless alternative means of correction have been attempted pursuant to Education Code 48900.5.
	 
	The District shall strive to ensure that no specific group of students, including a group based on race, ethnicity, language status, or special needs, is disproportionately enrolled in continuation education within the District.
	 
	The Superintendent or designee shall annually review disaggregated student enrollment data and report such data to the Board of Education. If it is determined that one or more student groups are enrolled in continuation education at a significantly higher level than their proportional enrollment in the District, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct a review of enrollment criteria and procedures to determine the reason for the disproportionate enrollment.
	 
	A copy of this administrative regulation and accompanying Board policy shall be provided to a student whose voluntary transfer to a continuation school is under consideration and to the student's parent/guardian.
	 
	Before a student is transferred and upon request by the student's parent/guardian, the parent/guardian may meet with a counselor, principal, or administrator from both the school that the student is currently attending and the continuation school to determine if transferring is the best option for the student.
	 
	To the extent possible, voluntary transfer to a continuation school shall occur within the first four weeks of each semester.
	 
	The transfer is voluntary, and the student has a right to return to the student's previous school.
	 
	A student who is voluntarily enrolled in continuation education may return to the regular high school at the beginning of the following school year, or at any other time with the consent of the Superintendent or designee.

Intake and Orientation

Upon voluntary or involuntary transfer to a continuation education program, an intake meeting shall be conducted with each student and the student's parent/guardian. At this meeting, the principal or counselor shall provide information about each course and the number of credits that the student needs to complete in order to graduate and shall develop an individualized academic plan for the student. The student, and the student's parent/guardian as appropriate, shall sign a contract indicating their commitment to these objectives.

In addition, at the beginning of each school year, the District coordinator for continuation education, school counselor(s), or other designee(s) shall provide an orientation session for all incoming students and their parents/guardians in order to explain the credit recovery process and establish expectations for student conduct and participation. As appropriate, extended orientation sessions may be provided to assist students in developing academic, social, communication, anger management, or other skills necessary to success in school.

Minimum Attendance Requirement

In continuation high schools and classes, a day of attendance shall be at least 180 minutes. (Education Code 46170)

Each student shall attend classes for not less than 15 hours per week.  However, if a student gives satisfactory proof of regular employment, the student may attend classes for not less than four hours per week for the regular school term.  These requirements may be met by any combination of attendance in a continuation education class and/or regional occupational center or program.  (Education Code 46170, 48402, 48400)

Leaves of Absence

A student enrolled in compulsory continuation education classes may take a leave of absence for up to two semesters for the purpose of supervised travel, study, training, or work in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.  (Education Code 48416)

Reenrollment

Any person age 16 or 17 years who terminated enrollment in continuation school after obtaining a certificate of proficiency may reenroll in the District once without prejudice.  If the student leaves a second time, the Superintendent or designee may deny reenrollment until the beginning of the next semester.  (Education Code 48414)
