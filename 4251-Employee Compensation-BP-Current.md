## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Districts that include provisions related to employee compensation in their collective bargaining agreements should modify or delete the following optional policy accordingly.
In order to recruit and retain employees committed to the district's goals for student learning, the Governing Board recognizes the importance of offering a competitive compensation package that includes salaries and health and welfare benefits.

CSBA NOTE:  Education Code 45023 and 45162 require the Governing Board to adopt salary schedules for certificated and classified employees, respectively. For districts operating under a merit system, Education Code 45268 specifies that the personnel commission will recommend a salary schedule for classified employees to the Board for approval and that the Board may not amend the schedule without first giving the commission a reasonable opportunity to respond to the amendments.
The Board shall adopt separate salary schedules for certificated, classified, and supervisory and administrative personnel that comply with law and applicable collective bargaining agreements.  (Education Code 45022, 45160, 45162, 45268)

Each certificated employee, except an employee in an administrative or supervisory position, shall be classified on the salary schedule on the basis of uniform allowance for education level and years of experience, unless the Board and employee organization negotiate and mutually agree to a salary schedule based on different criteria. Certificated employees shall not be placed in different classifications on the schedule, nor paid different salaries, solely on the basis of the grade levels at which they teach.  (Education Code 45028)

Salary schedules for staff who are not a part of a bargaining unit shall be determined by the Board at the recommendation of the Superintendent or designee.

The salary schedules adopted by the Board shall be printed and made available for review at the district office.  (Education Code 45023)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 42238.016, as added by AB 938 (Ch. 345, Statutes of 2024), districts are required, beginning January 31, 2026, to annually complete the Salary and Benefit Schedule for Bargaining Units (Form J-90), for classified and certificated staff assigned to a district school site and report the Form J-90 to the California Department of Education.
Additionally, by January 31, 2026, and annually thereafter, the Superintendent or designee shall complete the Salary and Benefit Schedule for Bargaining Units (Form J-90) for classified and certificated staff assigned to a district school site and report the Form J-90 to the California Department of Education.  (Education Code 42238.016)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45038, certificated employees may be paid once every two weeks, twice a month, or once every four weeks. Additionally, the Board may choose to pay certificated employees, or one or more individual employees, in 10, 11, or 12 equal payments over the year instead of by the school month. Education Code 45039 provides that, if the Board arranges to pay certificated employees in 12 equal payments for the year, it may pay each monthly installment at the end of each calendar month, regardless of whether the employees are actually engaged in teaching during the month. Education Code 45165 addresses salary payments for classified employees who are employed 9-11 months per year.In addition, pursuant to Education Code 45500, districts may participate in the Classified School Employee Summer Assistance Program whereby eligible classified employees may elect to have up to 10 percent of the employee's monthly salary withheld and paid out during the summer recess in either one or two payments.Education Code 45048 and 45165 provide specific timelines for issuing salary payments depending on the frequency of payments. If payments are not made in a timely manner, the district is required to pay the employee interest on the unpaid amount.The following paragraph may be revised to reflect the payroll schedule determined by the Board or as provided for in any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
Unless otherwise provided for in any applicable collective bargaining agreement, district employees shall be paid (insert frequency) and in ______equal payments over the year. However, if the district participates in the Classified School Employee Summer Assistance Program, eligible classified employees may elect to have up to 10 percent of the employee's monthly salary withheld and paid out during the summer recess in either one or two payments.  (Education Code 45038, 45039, 45048, 45165, 45500)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 29 CFR 516.4, districts are required to post a notice of the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 USC 201-219) in a conspicuous place at all work sites. The poster that must be used by state and local governments is available on the website of the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division.
The Superintendent or designee shall post a notice explaining the Fair Labor Standards Act's wage and hour provisions in a conspicuous place at each work site.  (29 CFR 516.4)

Overtime Compensation

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to the FLSA (29 CFR 553.20) and Education Code 45128, districts are required to pay employees who are not specifically exempted by law, including classified employees in both merit and non-merit system districts, overtime pay or compensatory time off at a rate not less than one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of eight hours in any one day and/or in excess of 40 hours per calendar week. However, if the Board has established a work day of less than eight hours but at least seven hours, and a work week of less than 40 hours but at least 35 hours, all time worked in excess of the established work schedule must be deemed overtime.Pursuant to Education Code 45130, districts are not required to pay overtime for any classified positions established by the Board, or by the personnel commission in a merit system district, as supervisory, administrative, or executive. In approving positions for exclusion from the overtime provisions, the Board or personnel commission must certify in writing that the duties, flexibility of hours, salary, benefit structure, and authority of the positions are of such a nature that they should be set apart from those positions which are subject to the overtime provisions; see BP/AR 4300 - Administrative and Supervisory Personnel. However, Education Code 45130 provides that, if a classified employee in an exempt position is required to work on a holiday designated in law or by the Board, the employee is required to be paid the regular pay for that day plus compensation or compensatory time off at a rate not less than the employee's normal rate of pay; see BP/AR 6115 - Ceremonies and Observances for more information regarding holidays designated in law or by the Board.Additionally, overtime pay requirements are not applicable to school administrators or teachers in elementary or secondary schools under specific exemptions in 29 USC 213 and 29 CFR 541.303. Pursuant to 29 CFR 541.303 and 541.600, teachers do not need to meet the salary level requirement to be exempt from overtime rules. 29 CFR 541.204 provides that, to be exempt from overtime rules, administrators must either meet the salary level requirement or be compensated on a salary basis that is at least equal to the entrance salary for teachers in the administrator's school.Labor Code provisions are not applicable to school districts unless specifically provided for in law. For example, in Johnson v. Arvin-Edison Water Storage District, the appellate court held in part that Labor Code 510, which provides for overtime compensation including that an employee who works in excess of 12 hours in one day or eight hours on the seventh consecutive day of a workweek is entitled to twice the regular rate of pay, does not apply to public agencies, including school districts.Due to the complex interactions between federal law and state law, as well as between different state law provisions and classes of employees, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel regarding employee overtime compensation, as necessary.
District employees shall be paid an overtime rate of not less than one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for any hours worked in excess of eight hours in one day and/or 40 hours in one work week. However, teachers, school administrators, and other employees in positions established by the Board as executive, administrative, or professional shall be exempt from overtime rules.  (Education Code 45128, 45130; 29 USC 213; 29 CFR 541.204, 541.303, 541.600 , 553.27, 553.32)

If the district requires a classified employee in an exempt position to work on a holiday designated in law or by the Board, the employee shall be paid the regular pay for that day plus compensation or compensatory time off at a rate not less than the employee's normal rate of pay.  (Education Code 45130)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that allow employees to take compensatory time off in lieu of overtime compensation as authorized by 29 USC 207 and 29 CFR 553.20-553.25. Time off in lieu of overtime compensation is allowed only if provided for in a collective bargaining agreement or other agreement and must be provided at the rate of at least one and one-half hours for each hour of overtime work.Pursuant to 29 CFR 553.21, an employee must be allowed to use earned compensatory time within a "reasonable period" after making the request. 29 CFR 553.25 provides that a "reasonable period" is determined on a case-by-case basis by considering customary work practices such as the normal work schedule, anticipated peak workloads based on past experience, emergency requirements for staff and services, and the availability of qualified substitute staff. Education Code 45129 provides that the compensatory time off must be used within 12 calendar months.
When authorized in a collective bargaining agreement or other agreement between the district and employees, an employee may take compensatory time off in lieu of overtime compensation, provided the employee has not accrued compensatory time in excess of the limits specified in 29 USC 207. An employee who has requested the use of compensatory time shall be allowed to use such time within 12 calendar months following the month the overtime was worked if the use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt district operations.  (Education Code 45129; 29 USC 207; 29 CFR 553.20-553.25)

For each nonexempt employee, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain records on the employee's wages, hours, and other information specified in 29 CFR 516.5-516.6.

Wage Overpayment

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44042.5 requires districts to follow the process specified below when a wage overpayment is made to a district employee. If the provisions of this section are in conflict with a collective bargaining agreement or a memorandum of understanding that was in effect on July 31, 2022, such agreements shall be controlling until the expiration or renewal of such agreements. It is recommended that the district consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel when questions arise about legal requirements for specific wage overpayments.If, following the determination of an overpayment, the employee disputes the existence or amount of the overpayment, the district is required to first initiate legal action and obtain a court order or binding arbitration decision validating the overpayment amount. Binding arbitration may only apply to such overpayment disputes if a memorandum of understanding between the district and exclusive representative sets forth procedures for adjudicating such wage overpayment disputes that meet the minimum requirements set forth in Education Code 44042.5.
If the district determines an employee has been overpaid, the district shall notify the employee in writing of the overpayment, afford the employee an opportunity to respond before commencing any recoupment actions, and inform the employee of the employee's rights to dispute the existence or amount of the claimed overpayment. If the employee agrees there was an overpayment in the claimed amount, reimbursement shall be made to the district through one of the methods described in Education Code 44042.5, as mutually agreed upon by the employee and the district.  (Education Code 44042.5)

If a mutual agreement on a method of reimbursement is not reached, within 30 days of the employee verifying the overpayment amount, the district shall recoup the overpayment through payroll deductions in accordance with Education Code 44042.5.

If the employee does not respond or disputes the existence or amount of the district's claimed overpayment, the district may only recover the overpayment after pursuing appropriate legal action.  (Education Code 44042.5)

If the employee separates from the district before the overpayment is fully repaid, the district shall withhold the remaining balance due from any money owed to the employee upon separation, provided that the state minimum wage is still paid to the employee as required by Education Code 44042.5. The Superintendent or designee may consult with legal counsel to calculate the amount to withhold.

If an outstanding overpayment balance still remains, the district may exercise any legal means to recover the remaining amount owed by the employee.  (Education Code 44042.5)

Legal action to recover any overpayment under this policy shall be initiated within three years from the date of the overpayment, which for leave credits is the date that the employee receives compensation in exchange for leave erroneously credited to the employee.  (Education Code 44042.5)

<strong>Overtime Compensation</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='xOA591' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to the FLSA (29 CFR 553.20) and Education Code 45128, districts are required to pay employees who are not specifically exempted by law, including classified employees in both merit and non-merit system districts, overtime pay or compensatory time off at a rate not less than one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of eight hours in any one day and/or in excess of 40 hours per calendar week. However, if the Board has established a work day of less than eight hours but at least seven hours, and a work week of less than 40 hours but at least 35 hours, all time worked in excess of the established work schedule must be deemed overtime.<br><br>Pursuant to Education Code 45130, districts are not required to pay overtime for any classified positions established by the Board, or by the personnel commission in a merit system district, as supervisory, administrative, or executive. In approving positions for exclusion from the overtime provisions, the Board or personnel commission must certify in writing that the duties, flexibility of hours, salary, benefit structure, and authority of the positions are of such a nature that they should be set apart from those positions which are subject to the overtime provisions; see BP/AR 4300 - Administrative and Supervisory Personnel. However, Education Code 45130 provides that, if a classified employee in an exempt position is required to work on a holiday designated in law or by the Board, the employee is required to be paid the regular pay for that day plus compensation or compensatory time off at a rate not less than the employee's normal rate of pay; see BP/AR 6115 - Ceremonies and Observances for more information regarding holidays designated in law or by the Board.<br><br>Additionally, overtime pay requirements are not applicable to school administrators or teachers in elementary or secondary schools under specific exemptions in 29 USC 213 and 29 CFR 541.303. Pursuant to 29 CFR 541.303 and 541.600, teachers do not need to meet the salary level requirement to be exempt from overtime rules. 29 CFR 541.204 provides that, to be exempt from overtime rules, administrators must either meet the salary level requirement or be compensated on a salary basis that is at least equal to the entrance salary for teachers in the administrator's school.<br><br>Labor Code provisions are not applicable to school districts unless specifically provided for in law. For example, in Johnson v. Arvin-Edison Water Storage District, the appellate court held in part that Labor Code 510, which provides for overtime compensation including that an employee who works in excess of 12 hours in one day or eight hours on the seventh consecutive day of a workweek is entitled to twice the regular rate of pay, does not apply to public agencies, including school districts.<br><br>Due to the complex interactions between federal law and state law, as well as between different state law provisions and classes of employees, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel regarding employee overtime compensation, as necessary.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="yNDQOA5"
