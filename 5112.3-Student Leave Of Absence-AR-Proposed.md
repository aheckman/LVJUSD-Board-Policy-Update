## Policy Content

Upon request, the Superintendent or designee may grant a student a leave of absence from school for the purpose of supervised travel, study, training, or work. To be eligible for such leave, the student shall, at the time the leave of absence is to begin, be at least 15 years of age or, if he/she is enrolled in continuation education classes or exempted from continuation education classes pursuant to Education Code 48410, be 16-18 years of age. (Education Code 48232, 48416)
	 
	A written agreement shall be made and signed by the student, the parents/guardians, the principal or designee of the school the student would otherwise attend, a classroom teacher familiar with the student's academic progress and chosen by the student, and the District supervisor of Child Welfare and Attendance. This agreement shall provide for:
	 
	
		The purpose of the leave
		 
		The length of the leave
		 
		Provision for a meeting or contact between the student and a designated school official at least once a month while the student is on the leave
		 
		A statement that the leave is for the purpose of supervised travel, study, training, or work not available to the student under another educational option
		
		The parents/guardians signature and approval shall not be required for an emancipated minor.
		 
	
	
	The length of the leave may be up to two trimesters. The leave may be extended for an additional trimester upon approval of all parties to the written agreement and the local school attendance review board. No leave of absence may be taken that would continue past the end of the school year in which the leave is taken. (Education Code 48232, 48416)
	 
	The student shall be permitted to return to school at any time and shall not be prevented from completing his/her academic requirements within a time period equal to that of classmates who did not take leave, plus the length of time spent on leave. If the student reenrolls at a time other than the beginning of a trimester, the school shall not be required to provide make-up sessions for classes missed. (Education Code 48232, 48416)
	 
	If the student does not contact the designated school official as required by the agreement, the leave shall be nullified. Any party to the agreement may nullify the agreement for cause at any time. (Education Code 48232, 48416)
