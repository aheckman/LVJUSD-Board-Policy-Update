## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that state achievement test results provide an indication of student progress in achieving state academic standards and may be used to promote high-quality teaching and learning. The Superintendent or designee shall administer mandatory student assessments within the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) as required by law and in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation.

The Board strongly encourages all students at the applicable grade levels to participate in the state assessments in order to maximize the usefulness of the data and enable the District to meet participation levels required for state and federal accountability systems. The Superintendent or designee shall notify students and parents/guardians about the importance of these assessments and shall develop strategies to encourage student participation.  Students shall be exempted from participation only in accordance with law and administrative regulation.

The Board shall annually examine state assessment results by school, grade level, and student subgroup as one measure of the District's progress in attaining its student achievement goals and shall revise the local control and accountability plan and other District or school plans as necessary to improve student achievement for underperforming student groups.
