## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following Board policy is for use by districts that grant permanent status to certificated employees following successful completion of a probationary period, and should be modified for consistency with the district's collective bargaining agreement if applicable.Pursuant to Education Code 44929.23, districts with an average daily attendance (ADA) of less than 250 may adopt a policy of annually reelecting certificated employees instead of granting them permanent status. Such districts may replace the following policy with a policy statement reflecting the decision to not grant permanent status in accordance with the authority granted pursuant to Education Code 44929.23. Probationary employees should not be confused with temporary employees, as there are significant differences in terms of the layoff procedures and reemployment rights applicable to them; see BP 4117.3 - Personnel Reduction.  According to the courts in Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School District and California Teachers Association v. Vallejo City Unified School District, employees who have not attained permanent status but who cannot properly be classified as temporary or substitute employees (see BP 4121 - Temporary/Substitute Personnel) must be classified as probationary employees. An employee should not be classified as temporary rather than probationary solely on the basis of not holding a clear credential (e.g., a holder of a preliminary credential, internship certificate, provisional internship permit, short-term staff permit, emergency permit, or credential waiver). In addition, in Stockton Teachers Association CTA/NEA v. Stockton Unified School District, the court held that employees hired for the term of a categorically funded project pursuant to Education Code 44909 may only be considered temporary employees if they are terminated at the expiration of the categorically funded project and, if not terminated, must be considered probationary employees.
The Governing Board desires to employ and retain highly qualified certificated personnel to implement the district's educational program.  Newly hired certificated personnel shall serve a probationary period during which the Board shall determine their suitability for long-term district employment.

Certificated employees who satisfactorily complete the probationary period shall be granted permanent status.

CSBA NOTE: The district should select the option below that reflects the ADA of the district.Pursuant to Education Code 44929.21, a district with ADA of 250 or more must grant permanent status in accordance with Option 1.Pursuant to Education Code 44949.23, if the Governing Board of a district with ADA of less than 250 elects to dismiss probationary employees during the school year in accordance with Education Code 44948.2 and 44948.3, the district must grant permanent status after two years (Option 1).  Other districts with less than 250 ADA may choose to grant permanent status after three years (Option 2).
OPTION 1:  (Districts of 250 ADA or more, and districts with less than 250 ADA whose Board has elected to dismiss probationary employees during the school year pursuant to Education Code 44948.2 and 44948.3)

A probationary employee who has been employed by the district in position(s) requiring certification for two complete consecutive school years and is then reelected for the next succeeding school year shall become a permanent employee at the beginning of the third year.  (Education Code 44929.21, 44929.23)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Districts with less than 250 ADA that grant permanent status after three years)

A probationary employee who has been employed by the district in a position(s) requiring certification for three complete consecutive school years and is then reelected for the next succeeding school year shall become a permanent employee at the beginning of the fourth year.    (Education Code 44929.23)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraphs apply to all districts.
During the probationary period, employees shall receive professional development and assistance which may consist of inservice training and/or meetings with the employee's evaluator to discuss areas of strength and areas requiring improvement.  Inservice training may be provided during school hours as part of a comprehensive staff development program.

The performance of each probationary employee shall be evaluated and assessed at least once every school year.

Dismissal/Nonreelection of Probationary Employees

During the school year, a probationary employee may be suspended or dismissed only for cause and in accordance with district procedures.  (Education Code 44948.3)

With proper notice, the Board may, without cause, elect not to reemploy a probationary employee for the subsequent year.    (Education Code 44929.21, 44929.23)

The Superintendent or designee shall annually provide the Board with recommendations regarding the reelection or nonreelection of probationary certificated personnel for the ensuing school year.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that grant permanent status to certificated employees after completion of two consecutive years of service (Option 1 above). Districts with less than 250 ADA that grant permanent status upon completion of three consecutive years of service (Option 2 above) should revise the following paragraph to indicate that a nonreelection notice may be provided during the employee's first or second year of employment if the probationary employee will not be reelected for the following year.
At any time during a probationary employee's first year of employment in the district, the Board may give written notice to the employee of the Board's decision not to reelect the employee for a second school year.  If the Board does not give written notice, the employee shall be deemed reelected for the next succeeding school year.

CSBA NOTE: For districts that select Option 1 above, Education Code 44929.21 requires the district to give written notice, as provided below, if the probationary employee will not be reelected for the third year. Districts with less than 250 ADA must also provide notice by March 15 pursuant to Education Code 44948.5.
During the final year of the probationary period, the Board may decide not to reelect the employee for the following year, and shall so notify the employee in writing on or before March 15.  If the Board does not give written notice on or before March 15, the employee shall be deemed reelected for the next succeeding school year.  (Education Code 44929.21, 44948.5)

CSBA NOTE: State law does not specify a method that must be used to provide the above notice to a probationary employee who is not reelected for the subsequent school year.  The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.In Grace v. Beaumont Unified School District, the court ruled that acceptable methods of notification include email, certified mail if a return receipt shows that the letter was received before March 15, oral notification, and/or adoption and publication of termination decision(s) by employee number at a board meeting when the employee is present.In Hoschler v. Sacramento City Unified School District, the court held that, when providing notice of nonreelection pursuant to Education Code 44929.21, the district must ensure that the employee receives notice on or before March 15 either through personal service or through another method equivalent to imparting actual notice.  Because the district provided notice via certified mail but did not have evidence that the employee received the certified letter on or before March 15, the notice was not timely and the employee was deemed to have been reelected for the subsequent school year.In Sullivan v. Centinela Valley Union High School District, the court held that a probationary teacher who avoided service of the notice may not assert failure of notice since it reasonably can be inferred that the teacher did so with knowledge of the nonreelection decision.
Such notices shall be delivered through personal service upon the employee, certified mail with return receipt, email, or another method which documents actual receipt of the notice by the employee.

Beaumont Unified School District, the court ruled that acceptable methods of notification include email, certified mail if a return receipt shows that the letter was received before March 15, oral notification, and/or adoption and publication of termination decision(s) by employee number at a board meeting when the employee is present.<br><br>In Hoschler v. Sacramento City Unified School District, the court held that, when providing notice of nonreelection pursuant to Education Code 44929.21, the district must ensure that the employee receives notice on or before March 15 either through personal service or through another method equivalent to imparting actual notice.  Because the district provided notice via certified mail but did not have evidence that the employee received the certified letter on or before March 15, the notice was not timely and the employee was deemed to have been reelected for the subsequent school year.<br><br>In Sullivan v. Centinela Valley Union High School District, the court held that a probationary teacher who avoided service of the notice may not assert failure of notice since it reasonably can be inferred that the teacher did so with knowledge of the nonreelection decision.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="IOTcNg5" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22IOTcNg5%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22zOA978%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1573581490%2C%22text%22%3A%22State%20law%20does%20not%20specify%20a%20method%20that%20must%20be%20used%20to%20provide%20the%20above%20notice%20to%20a%20probationary%20employee%20who%20is%20not%20reelected%20for%20the%20subsequent%20school%20year.%20%20The%20following%20paragraph%20may%20be%20revised%20to%20reflect%20district%20practice.%5Cn%5CnIn%20Grace%20v.%20Beaumont%20Unified%20School%20District%2C%20the%20court%20ruled%20that%20acceptable%20methods%20of%20notification%20include%20email%2C%20certified%20mail%20if%20a%20return%20receipt%20shows%20that%20the%20letter%20was%20received%20before%20March%2015%2C%20oral%20notification%2C%20and/or%20adoption%20and%20publication%20of%20termination%20decision%28s%29%20by%20employee%20number%20at%20a%20board%20meeting%20when%20the%20employee%20is%20present.%5Cn%5CnIn%20Hoschler%20v.%20Sacramento%20City%20Unified%20School%20District%2C%20the%20court%20held%20that%2C%20when%20providing%20notice%20of%20nonreelection%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2044929.21%2C%20the%20district%20must%20ensure%20that%20the%20employee%20receives%20notice%20on%20or%20before%20March%2015%20either%20through%20personal%20service%20or%20through%20another%20method%20equivalent%20to%20imparting%20actual%20notice.%20%20Because%20the%20district%20provided%20notice%20via%20certified%20mail%20but%20did%20not%20have%20evidence%20that%20the%20employee%20received%20the%20certified%20letter%20on%20or%20before%20March%2015%2C%20the%20notice%20was%20not%20timely%20and%20the%20employee%20was%20deemed%20to%20have%20been%20reelected%20for%20the%20subsequent%20school%20year.%5Cn%5CnIn%20Sullivan%20v.%20Centinela%20Valley%20Union%20High%20School%20District%2C%20the%20court%20held%20that%20a%20probationary%20teacher%20who%20avoided%20service%20of%20the%20notice%20may%20not%20assert%20failure%20of%20notice%20since%20it%20reasonably%20can%20be%20inferred%20that%20the%20teacher%20did%20so%20with%20knowledge%20of%20the%20nonreelection%20decision.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-IOTcNg5" title="CSBA NOTE: State law does not specify a method tha..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
