## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 32280-32289.5, districts are responsible for ensuring that a comprehensive safety plan with specified components is in place for each district school. As required by Education Code 32282 and 32288, the California Department of Education (CDE) has posted on its website a compliance checklist for developing comprehensive safety plans and best practices for reviewing and approving the plans. Comprehensive safety plans are reviewed through the annual audits required by Education Code 41020 to ensure that they are updated and approved by March 1 of each year.
The Governing Board recognizes that students and staff have the right to a safe and secure campus where they are free from physical and psychological harm. The Board is fully committed to maximizing school safety and to creating a positive learning environment that includes strategies for violence prevention and high expectations for student conduct, responsible behavior, and respect for others.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 32281 and 32286, each school is required to adopt a comprehensive safety plan (Option 1 below). However, districts with an average daily attendance (ADA) of 2,500 or less are authorized by Education Code 32281 to develop a districtwide comprehensive safety plan in lieu of developing school plans; thus, those districts may select either Option 1 or 2 to reflect district practice. Any district may choose to develop both district and school plans.
OPTION 1:  (Districts with more than 2,500 ADA, and districts with 2,500 or less ADA that choose to develop school site plans)

The school site council at each district school shall develop a comprehensive school safety plan relevant to the needs and resources of that particular school. New school campuses shall develop a comprehensive safety plan within one year of initiating operations.  (Education Code 32281, 32286)

The comprehensive school safety plan shall take into account the school's staffing, available resources, and building design, as well as other factors unique to the site.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Districts with 2,500 or less ADA that choose to develop a districtwide plan)

The Superintendent or designee shall oversee the development of a districtwide comprehensive safety plan that is applicable to each school site.  (Education Code 32281)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following two paragraphs apply to all districts. Education Code 32286 requires that the school site council review and update the comprehensive safety plan by March 1 of each year. In districts with ADA of 2,500 or less that choose to develop a districtwide plan in accordance with Option 2 above, the Superintendent or designee may conduct the annual review.Pursuant to Education Code 32288, the updated plan(s) must be submitted to the Governing Board for approval. The Board may choose to delegate to the Superintendent or designee the responsibility to review and approve the updated plans, but the Board remains responsible for ensuring compliance with the law.
The comprehensive safety plan(s) shall be reviewed and updated by March 1 of each year and forwarded to the Board for approval.  (Education Code 32286, 32288)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 32282, as amended by SB 323 (Ch. 599, Statutes of 2023), the annual evaluation of the comprehensive safety plan is required to include ensuring that the plan provides appropriate adaptations for students with disabilities.
The Board shall review the comprehensive safety plan(s) in order to ensure compliance with state law, Board policy, and administrative regulation and shall approve the plan(s) at a regularly scheduled meeting.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 32288 requires that districts notify CDE if a school has not complied with the comprehensive safety plan requirements. In the event that the Superintendent of Public Instruction determines that there has been a willful failure by a district to make any report required by Education Code 32280-32289, Education Code 32287 provides that the district may be fined up to $2,000.
By October 15 of each year, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the California Department of Education (CDE) of any schools that have not complied with the requirements of Education Code 32281.  (Education Code 32288)

Tactical Response Plan

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional. Pursuant to Education Code 32281, the Board may, after consulting with law enforcement officials, elect to have the district, rather than the school site council, develop those portions of the comprehensive safety plan that include tactical responses to criminal incidents that may result in death or serious bodily injury.
Notwithstanding the process described above, any portion of a comprehensive safety plan that addresses tactical responses to criminal incidents that may result in death or serious bodily injury at the school site, including steps to safeguard students and staff, secure affected school premises, and apprehend criminal perpetrator(s), shall be developed by the Superintendent or designee in accordance with Education Code 32281. In developing such strategies, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with law enforcement officials and with representative(s) of employee bargaining unit(s), if they choose to participate.

When reviewing the tactical response plan, the Board may meet in closed session to confer with law enforcement officials and approve the tactical response plan, provided that any vote to approve the tactical response plan is announced in open session following the closed session.  (Education Code 32281)

Safety Plan(s) Access and Reporting

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that an updated file of all safety-related plans and materials is readily available for inspection by the public.  (Education Code 32282)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Pursuant to Education Code 32281, the Board may choose to prohibit disclosure of those portions of the comprehensive safety plan that include tactical responses to criminal incidents.
However, those portions of the comprehensive safety plan that include tactical responses to criminal incidents need not be publicly disclosed.

The Superintendent or designee shall share the comprehensive safety plans and any updates to the plans with local law enforcement, the local fire department, and other first responder entities.  (Education Code 32281)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 32289.5, the district is required to provide data to CDE pertaining to lockdown or multi-option response drills conducted at district schools, as specified.
The Superintendent or designee shall also provide data to CDE pertaining to lockdown or multi-option response drills conducted at district schools in accordance with Education Code 32289.5.  (Education Code 32289.5)
