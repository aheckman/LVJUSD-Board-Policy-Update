## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The district should select Option 1 and/or Option 2 below in accordance with the accompanying board policy. For guidance see the accompanying board policy.
OPTION 1:  Interdistrict Attendance Agreements and Permits

CSBA NOTE: The following option is for use by districts that have entered into an agreement with one or more other school districts to accept transfers through the "interdistrict attendance permit" or "reciprocal agreement" process pursuant to Education Code 46600-46610.  (See Option 1 in the accompanying Board policy.)  In 87 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 132 (2004), the Attorney General opined that districts could not charge students a fee for processing applications for interdistrict attendance.
In accordance with an agreement between the Governing Board and the board of another district, a permit authorizing a student of either district to enroll in the other district may be issued upon approval of both districts.

The district shall post on its website the procedures and timelines for requesting an interdistrict transfer permit, including a link to BP 5117 - Interdistrict Attendance. The posted information shall include, but is not limited to:  (Education Code 46600.1, 46600.2)

	The date upon which the district will begin accepting and processing interdistrict transfer requests for the following school year
	 
	The reasons for which the district may approve or deny a request, and any information or documents that must be submitted as supporting evidence
	 
	If applicable, the process and timelines by which a denial of a request may be appealed within the district before the district renders a final decision
	 
	A statement that failure of a parent/guardian to meet any timelines established by the district shall be deemed an abandonment of the request
	 
	Applicable timelines for processing a request, including the following statements:
	 
	
		For an interdistrict transfer request received by the district 15 or fewer calendar days before the commencement of instruction in the school year for which the transfer is sought, the district will notify the parent/guardian of its final decision within 30 calendar days from the date the request was received.
		 
		For an interdistrict transfer request received by the district more than 15 days before the commencement of instruction in the school year for which the interdistrict transfer is sought, the district will notify the parent/guardian of its final decision as soon as possible, but no later than 14 calendar days after the commencement of instruction in the school year for which transfer is sought.
		 
	
	
	The conditions under which an existing interdistrict transfer permit may be revoked or rescinded


CSBA NOTE: Education Code 46600 requires districts to give priority for interdistrict attendance permits to a student who is a victim of an act of bullying, as provided below.  For this purpose, Education Code 48900(r) defines bullying to include, but not be limited to, bullying committed by means of an electronic act directed specifically toward the student; see AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process.
Priority for interdistrict attendance shall be given to a student who has been determined, through an investigation by either the district of residence or district of proposed enrollment, to be a victim of an act of bullying, as defined in Education Code 48900(r), committed by a student of the district of residence.  (Education Code 46600)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 46600 requires districts to ensure that students who are victims of bullying or are children of active duty military parents/guardians be selected through an unbiased process that prohibits consideration of specified characteristics. 
Until the district is at maximum capacity, the district shall accept any student whose interdistrict transfer application is based on being the victim of an act of bullying or a child of an active duty military parent/guardian. The district shall ensure that such students are admitted through an unbiased process that prohibits an inquiry into or evaluation or consideration of whether or not a student should be enrolled based on academic or athletic performance, physical condition, proficiency in English, family income, or any of the individual characteristics set forth in Education Code 220, including, but not limited to, race or ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, and immigration status.  (Education Code 46600)

In addition, the Superintendent or designee may approve an interdistrict attendance permit for a student for any of the following reasons when stipulated in the agreement:

CSBA NOTE: Optional Items #1-11 below should be revised and/or deleted to reflect district practice.


	To meet the child care needs of the student, only as long as the student's child care provider remains within district boundaries
	 
	To meet the student's special mental or physical health needs as certified by a physician, school psychologist, or other appropriate school personnel
	 
	When the student has a sibling attending school in the receiving district, to avoid splitting the family's attendance
	 
	To allow the student to complete a school year when the student's parents/guardians have moved out of the district during that year
	 
	To allow the student to remain with a class graduating that year from an elementary, middle, or senior high school
	 
	To allow a high school senior to attend the same school attended as a junior, even if the student's family moved out of the district during the junior year
	 
	When the parent/guardian provides written evidence that the family will be moving into the district in the immediate future and would like the student to start the school year in the district
	 
	When the student will be living out of the district for one year or less
	 
	When recommended by the school attendance review board or by county child welfare, probation, or social service agency staff in documented cases of serious home or community problems which make it inadvisable for the student to attend the school of residence
	 
	When there is valid interest in a particular educational program not offered in the district of residence
	 
	To provide a change in school environment for reasons of personal and social adjustment


CSBA NOTE: In 84 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 198 (2001), the Attorney General opined that a lack of school facilities is a justifiable reason for denial of the interdistrict attendance permit request.  However, according to the Attorney General, once the student is admitted, the district may not later deny the student continued attendance at a district school because of overcrowding. Although Attorney General opinions are not binding on the courts, they are generally afforded deference in the court when there is no specific statutory or case law to the contrary. The following paragraph is based on this Attorney General opinion.
The Superintendent or designee may deny initial requests for interdistrict attendance permits due to limited district resources, overcrowding of school facilities at the relevant grade level, or other considerations that are not arbitrary.  However, once a student is admitted, the district shall not deny continued attendance because of overcrowded facilities at the relevant grade level.

If the transfer request is for a school year that begins within 15 calendar days of the receipt of the request, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the parent/guardian of the final decision within 30 calendar days of receiving the request. If the transfer request is for a school year that begins more than 15 calendar days after the receipt of the request, the parent/guardian shall be notified of the final decision as soon as possible, but no later than 14 calendar days after the commencement of instruction during that school year.  (Education Code 46600.2)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 46600.2 requires a district that denies a request for an interdistrict transfer to give written notice to the parent/guardian of the right to appeal to the County Board of Education.Pursuant to Education Code 46601, parents/guardians may submit their appeal to the County Board within 30 calendar days of the district's final denial of the permit. The County Board then has 30 calendar days, unless extended by an additional five school days for good cause, to make its determination as to whether the student should be allowed to attend the district of proposed enrollment and the applicable period of attendance.Pursuant to Education Code 46602, if the County Board determines that the student should be permitted to attend the district of proposed enrollment, the district shall admit the student without delay.
If a student's interdistrict transfer request is denied, the Superintendent or designee shall, in writing, notify the parents/guardians of their right to appeal to the County Board of Education within 30 calendar days from the date of the final denial.  (Education Code 46600.2)

All notices to parents/guardians regarding the district's decision on any request for interdistrict transfer shall conform to the translation requirements of Education Code 48985, and may be provided by regular mail, electronic format if the parent/guardian provides an email address, or by any other method normally used to communicate with parents/guardians in writing.  (Education Code 46600.2)

Pending a decision by the two districts or by the County Board on appeal, the Superintendent or designee may provisionally admit a student who resides in another district for a period not to exceed two school months, provided the district is the district of proposed enrollment. If the decision has not been rendered by the conclusion of two school months and the districts or County Board is still operating within the prescribed timelines, the student shall not be allowed to continue attending the district school to which the student was provisionally admitted.  (Education Code 46603)

Students who are under consideration for expulsion or who have been expelled may not appeal interdistrict attendance denials or rescissions while expulsion proceedings are pending or during the term of the expulsion.  (Education Code 46601)

Once a student is admitted to a school on the basis of an interdistrict attendance permit, the student shall not be required to reapply for an interdistrict transfer and shall be allowed to continue to attend the school of enrollment, unless reapplication standards are otherwise specified in the interdistrict attendance agreement. Existing interdistrict attendance permits shall not be rescinded after June 30 following a student's completion of grade 10 or for any student entering grade 11 or 12 in the subsequent school year.  (Education Code 46600)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  School District of Choice Program

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that elect to participate in the school district of choice program pursuant to Education Code 48300-48317.  (See Option 2 in the accompanying Board policy.)
The Superintendent or designee shall communicate with parents/guardians regarding transfer opportunities under the school district of choice program. Communications sent to parents/guardians shall be available in all languages for which translations are required pursuant to Education Code 48985, shall be factually accurate, and shall not target particular neighborhoods or individual parents/guardians on the basis of a child's actual or perceived academic or athletic skill or any other personal characteristic.  (Education Code 48301, 48980)

The Superintendent or designee shall also make public announcements regarding district schools, programs, policies, and procedures, including transportation options if applicable, during the enrollment period.  (Education Code 48312)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph reflects Education Code 48302, which encourages districts to hold informational meetings as described below, and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee may hold informational meetings on the district's current educational programs, so that parents/guardians can provide input to the district on methods to improve current programs and make informed decisions regarding their children's education.  (Education Code 48302)

The process for student transfers into the district under the school district of choice program, including, but not limited to, any applicable form, the timeline for a transfer, and an explanation of the selection process, shall be posted on the district's website.  (Education Code 48301)

Parents/guardians shall submit applications for interdistrict attendance to the district office before January 1 of the school year preceding the school year for which the student is requesting to be transferred. The application deadline may be waived upon agreement between the district and the student's district of residence.  (Education Code 48308)

The application deadline shall not apply to an application requesting a transfer if the parent/guardian with whom the student resides is enlisted in the military and was relocated by the military within 90 days prior to submitting the application.  (Education Code 48308)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48305, if the district chooses to use existing entrance criteria for specialized schools or programs, then the criteria must be uniformly applied. The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that choose to use existing entrance criteria.
Any existing entrance criteria for specialized schools or programs shall be uniformly applied to all applicants.  (Education Code 48305)

The district may deny a transfer into the district under the school district of choice program if the transfer would require the district to create a new program to serve that student, except that the district shall not reject the transfer of a student with disabilities or an English learner.  (Education Code 48303)

Whenever the number of transfer applications exceeds the number of interdistrict transfers that may be accepted as annually determined by the Board, students accepted for transfer shall be selected by a random drawing held in public at a regularly scheduled Board meeting before February 15 of the school year preceding the school year for which the transfer is sought.  (Education Code 48301)

Priority for transfer under the school district of choice program shall be granted as follows:  (Education Code 48306)

	First priority shall be given to siblings of students already in attendance in the district.
	 
	Second priority shall be given to students eligible for free or reduced-price meals.
	 
	Third priority shall be given to children of military personnel.


No later than February 15 of the school year preceding the school year for which the student is requesting to be transferred, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the parent/guardian in writing whether the application has been provisionally accepted or rejected or of the student's position on any waiting list.  (Education Code 48308)

If a student's application for transfer is accepted, the Superintendent or designee shall so notify the student's district of residence no later than February 15 of the school year preceding the school year for which the student is requesting to be transferred.  (Education Code 48308)

The number of students accepted for transfer into the district, by school and grade level, shall be reported to the district of residence on or before February 15.  (Education Code 48308)

If a student's application is denied, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the student's parents/guardians that the number of students requesting to transfer exceeded the district's capacity and that the student was not selected during the random drawing. Such determination shall be accurately recorded in the minutes of the Board meeting at which the determination was made.  (Education Code 48308)

For a student whose parent/guardian was relocated by the military less than 90 days prior to the submission of the application, the district shall make a final decision to accept or reject the application within 90 days of its receipt. If the student's application has been submitted less than 90 days prior to the beginning of the school year, then the district shall accept or deny the application before the school year begins. Upon acceptance, the student may immediately enroll in a district school.  (Education Code 48308)

Vacancies may be filled from the waiting list until May 1 of the school year preceding the school year for which students are requesting to be transferred.  (Education Code 48308)

The final number of students enrolled in the district through the school district of choice program, by school and grade level, along with the names of the students, shall be reported to the district of residence on or before May 2.  (Education Code 48308)

Students admitted through the school district of choice program are deemed to have fulfilled district residency requirements pursuant to Education Code 48204.  (Education Code 48301)

Final acceptance of the transfer is applicable for one school year and shall be renewed automatically each year unless the Board, by adoption of a resolution, withdraws from participation in the program and no longer accepts transfer students from other districts.  (Education Code 48308)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised by districts that do not maintain high schools.
Even if the district withdraws from participation in the program, students who attended or received a notice of acceptance into the district before the Board's resolution of withdrawal shall be permitted to attend school in the district, and admitted high school students may continue attending school in the district until they graduate from high school.  (Education Code 48307, 48308)

The district may accept any completed coursework, attendance, and other academic progress credited to an accepted student by any district(s) the student has previously attended and may grant academic standing to the student based upon the district's evaluation of the student's academic progress.  (Education Code 48309)

The district may revoke a student's enrollment if the student is recommended for expulsion pursuant to Education Code 48918.  (Education Code 48309)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

Transfers Out of the District

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by all districts.
A student whose parent/guardian is in active military duty shall not be prohibited from transferring out of the district, provided the school district of proposed enrollment approves the application for transfer.  (Education Code 46600, 48307)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46600, the district cannot prohibit a transfer out of the district for a victim of bullying if the district has only one school offering the student's grade level and thus is unable to grant an intradistrict transfer.
If the district is unable to provide an intradistrict transfer to a student who is a victim of an act of bullying, as defined in Education Code 46600, the district shall not prohibit the student from transferring out of the district if the district of proposed enrollment approves the application for transfer.  (Education Code 46600)

The district may limit transfers out of the district to a school district of choice under any of the following circumstances:  (Education Code 48307)

CSBA NOTE: Even if a district has not designated itself as a school district of choice, it has the authority pursuant to Education Code 48307 to limit the number of students transferring out of the district into other districts that have designated themselves as school districts of choice. A district with an ADA of more than 50,000 may annually limit the number of such transfers to one percent of its current year estimated ADA. A district with an ADA of 50,000 or less may limit the number of such transfers to three percent of its current estimated ADA and may limit the maximum number of such transfers for the duration of the program to 10 percent of the ADA for that period. In Walnut Valley Unified School District v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, the appellate court held that the 10 percent cap on outbound transfers "for the duration of the program" should be based on the district's ADA over the entire life of the district of choice program (i.e., from the program's inception in 1994 until the present day). The district may revise Item #1 to reflect the applicable percentage in Education Code 48307 based on its ADA.


	The number of student transfers out of the district to a school district of choice has reached the limit specified in Education Code 48307 based on the district's average daily attendance.
	 
	The County Superintendent of Schools has given the district a negative budget certification or has determined that the district will not meet the state's standards and criteria for fiscal stability in the subsequent fiscal year exclusively as a result of student transfers from this district to a school district of choice.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #3 is optional and should be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 48307 authorizes the district to prohibit a transfer out of the district under the school district of choice program if the Board determines that the transfer would negatively impact a court-ordered desegregation plan, a voluntary desegregation plan, or the racial and ethnic balance of the district. Education Code 48307 provides that denial of transfers on the basis of a voluntary desegregation plan or the racial and ethnic balance of the district must be consistent with the constitutional provisions added by Proposition 209 in 1996 (California Constitution, Article 1, Section 31). It is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel before adopting policy to allow denial of transfers on either of these bases.
	The Board determines that the transfer would negatively impact any of the following:  (Education Code 48307)
	 
	
		A court-ordered desegregation plan
		 
		A voluntary desegregation plan of the district, consistent with the California Constitution, Article 1, Section 31
		 
		The racial and ethnic balance of the district, consistent with the California Constitution, Article 1, Section 31

<div id='xOQ795' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: In 84 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 198 (2001), the Attorney General opined that a lack of school facilities is a justifiable reason for denial of the interdistrict attendance permit request.  However, according to the Attorney General, once the student is admitted, the district may not later deny the student continued attendance at a district school because of overcrowding. Although Attorney General opinions are not binding on the courts, they are generally afforded deference in the court when there is no specific statutory or case law to the contrary.

The district may limit transfers out of the district to a school district of choice under any of the following circumstances:&nbsp; (Education Code 48307)<br>
<br>
<div id='yNA803' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Even if a district has not designated itself as a school district of choice, it has the authority pursuant to Education Code 48307 to limit the number of students transferring out of the district into other districts that have designated themselves as school districts of choice. A district with an ADA of more than 50,000 may annually limit the number of such transfers to one percent of its current year estimated ADA. A district with an ADA of 50,000 or less may limit the number of such transfers to three percent of its current estimated ADA and may limit the maximum number of such transfers for the duration of the program to 10 percent of the ADA for that period. In Walnut Valley Unified School District v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, the appellate court held that the 10 percent cap on outbound transfers "for the duration of the program" should be based on the district's ADA over the entire life of the district of choice program (i.e., from the program's inception in 1994 until the present day). The district may revise Item #1 to reflect the applicable percentage in Education Code 48307 based on its ADA.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="NTAwNw12" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22NTAwNw12%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22yNA803%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1690842694%2C%22text%22%3A%22Even%20if%20a%20district%20has%20not%20designated%20itself%20as%20a%20school%20district%20of%20choice%2C%20it%20has%20the%20authority%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2048307%20to%20limit%20the%20number%20of%20students%20transferring%20out%20of%20the%20district%20into%20other%20districts%20that%20have%20designated%20themselves%20as%20school%20districts%20of%20choice.%20A%20district%20with%20an%20ADA%20of%20more%20than%2050%2C000%20may%20annually%20limit%20the%20number%20of%20such%20transfers%20to%20one%20percent%20of%20its%20current%20year%20estimated%20ADA.%20A%20district%20with%20an%20ADA%20of%2050%2C000%20or%20less%20may%20limit%20the%20number%20of%20such%20transfers%20to%20three%20percent%20of%20its%20current%20estimated%20ADA%20and%20may%20limit%20the%20maximum%20number%20of%20such%20transfers%20for%20the%20duration%20of%20the%20program%20to%2010%20percent%20of%20the%20ADA%20for%20that%20period.%20In%20Walnut%20Valley%20Unified%20School%20District%20v.%20Superior%20Court%20of%20Los%20Angeles%20County%2C%20the%20appellate%20court%20held%20that%20the%2010%20percent%20cap%20on%20outbound%20transfers%20%5C%22for%20the%20duration%20of%20the%20program%5C%22%20should%20be%20based%20on%20the%20district%27s%20ADA%20over%20the%20entire%20life%20of%20the%20district%20of%20choice%20program%20%28i.e.%2C%20from%20the%20program%27s%20inception%20in%201994%20until%20the%20present%20day%29.%20The%20district%20may%20revise%20Item%20%231%20to%20reflect%20the%20applicable%20percentage%20in%20Education%20Code%2048307%20based%20on%20its%20ADA.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-NTAwNw12" title="CSBA NOTE: Even if a district has not designated i..."></annotation>
