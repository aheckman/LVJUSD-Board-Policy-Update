## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.  Education Code 49160 requires minors to obtain a work permit issued by the proper educational officers in order to accept employment, even for periods when school is not in session.  See the accompanying administrative regulation for further information about the conditions under which a work permit is required, specified exceptions, and the process for issuing permits.
The Governing Board recognizes that part-time employment can provide students with income, job experience, and valuable life skills and should be permitted to the extent that such employment does not interfere with a student's education.   Before accepting any offer of employment, district students who are minors shall obtain work permits from the Superintendent or designee, regardless of whether the employment will occur when school is in session and/or not in session, unless otherwise exempted by law.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49111, 49112, and 49116 and Labor Code 1391-1391.1 limit the number of hours that students may work on school days and days when school is not in session; see the accompanying administrative regulation. According to the Department of Industrial Relations' Child Labor Laws, districts have discretion to establish lower limits than provided by law for the maximum number of work hours and may impose additional requirements such as a minimum grade point average (e.g., 2.0) for issuance of a work permit. However, Education Code 49200, as added by AB 908 (Ch. 64, Statutes of 2020), prohibits consideration of grades, grade point average, or school attendance in the event the student's school has been physically closed for an extended time due to a natural disaster, pandemic, or other emergency.  See the accompanying administrative regulation.The following optional paragraph should be revised to reflect criteria established by the Board.
In determining whether to grant or continue a work permit, the Superintendent or designee shall consider whether employment is likely to significantly interfere with the student's schoolwork. Students granted work permits shall be required to demonstrate and maintain a 2.0 grade point average and satisfactory school attendance, except during periods of extended school closure due to an emergency as described in Education Code 49200 and the accompanying administrative regulation.  On a case-by-case basis, the Superintendent or designee may approve a maximum work hour limit that is lower than the limit specified in law and administrative regulation.

Students with work permits may be exempted from attendance in a full-time day school provided they attend part-time classes.  (Education Code 48230)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49130-49135 specify circumstances under which students between the ages of 14 and 18 may receive a permit to work full time.
Work permits shall be limited to part-time employment as defined by law, except when the Superintendent or designee determines that circumstances warrant the granting of a permit for full-time employment.

Any student authorized to work full time when school is in session shall be enrolled in part-time continuation classes.  A student age 14 or 15 who receives a permit to work full time shall also be enrolled in a work experience education program.  (Education Code 49130, 49131, 49135)
