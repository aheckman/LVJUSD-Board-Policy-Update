## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation may be revised to reflect district practice.
Curriculum Review Committee

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect the composition of the district's curriculum review committee. Also see AR 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials for legal requirements for substantial teacher involvement in the selection of instructional materials, which may include establishment of an instructional materials evaluation committee.
The Superintendent or designee may establish a curriculum review committee to evaluate and recommend curriculum for Governing Board approval. This committee shall consist of a majority of teachers and may also include administrators, other staff who have subject-matter expertise, parents/guardians, representatives of local businesses and postsecondary institutions, other community members, and students as appropriate.  This committee may be the same committee charged with the evaluation and recommendation of instructional materials pursuant to Board policy and administrative regulation.

Curriculum Development/Selection Process

The Superintendent or designee shall research and identify available curriculum in the subject area(s) and grade level(s) scheduled for review.  He/she may select a limited number of programs to present to the curriculum review committee for evaluation. 

The committee shall recommend the curriculum that best meets the district's needs based on the following criteria and any additional factors deemed relevant by the committee:
 

	Analysis of the effectiveness of the existing district curriculum for all students, including student achievement data disaggregated by grade level and student population
	 
	Alignment of the proposed curriculum with expectations established by the Board and the State Board of Education as to what students need to know and be able to do in the subject(s) and grade level(s) under consideration
	 
	Evidence of proven effectiveness of the proposed curriculum in raising student achievement, including the research and learning theory upon which the curriculum is based
	 
	Applicability and accessibility of the curriculum to all students, including, but not limited to, underperforming students, students with disabilities, English learners, and gifted and talented students
	 
	The estimated cost to purchase, adapt, and/or develop the curriculum
	 
	Resources required to implement the curriculum, such as time, facilities, instructional materials and technology, staffing, staff development, and funding
	 
	If the curriculum includes instructional materials, the extent to which the materials meet criteria established by law and the district
	 
	Any potential impact on other parts of the educational program


If it is determined that available prepackaged curriculum is not cost effective or is inadequate to meet the needs of the district's students, the Superintendent or designee may adapt curriculum or develop new curriculum.  Curriculum modification or development shall be performed by teachers, school administrators, and district administrators, with support and assistance, when available, from curriculum experts from the county office of education, postsecondary institutions, and/or curriculum or professional associations. Any modified or new curriculum shall be reviewed by the curriculum committee in accordance with the above criteria prior to being recommended to the Board.

Upon approval by the Board, a new curriculum may be implemented in a limited number of schools or classrooms on a pilot basis so that modifications may be made as necessary before implementing the curriculum districtwide.
