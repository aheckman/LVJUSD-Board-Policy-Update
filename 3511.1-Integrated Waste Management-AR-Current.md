## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation may be revised to reflect district practice.
For all applicable areas of district operations, the Superintendent or designee shall design an integrated waste management program that minimizes the generation of waste, encourages the recovery and diversion of reusable materials from the waste stream, improves efficiency in the utilization of natural and material resources, and protects the environment.  The program shall implement measures and/or practices to:

	Reduce the consumption of disposable materials, increase the composting of organic materials, and fully utilize all materials prior to disposal
	 
	Recycle materials such as paper, glass, plastic, and aluminum
	 
	Prefer recycled, biodegradable, and other environmentally preferable products when procuring materials for use in district schools and buildings or contracting for the construction or modernization of any district building
	 
	Work with city, county, or other government agencies to locate markets for the district's reusable and recyclable materials
	 
	Minimize the use of nonbiodegradable materials and work with vendors and contractors to use packaging and delivery materials that generate less waste

Recycling

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Public Resources Code 42649.2, any business or public entity, including a school or other district facility, which generates four or more cubic yards of commercial solid waste per week (approximately the size of a 72-inch length, 51-inch width, and 56-inch rear height dumpster) is required to arrange for recycling services in accordance with law, to the extent that such services are available from a local provider. Commercial solid waste, as defined in Public Resources Code 42649.1, means any type of solid waste generated by stores, offices, or other commercial or public entity source.
Any school site or district facility which generates four or more cubic yards of solid waste per week shall take at least one of the following actions:  (Public Resources Code 42649.1, 42649.2)

	Source separate recyclable materials from solid waste and subscribe to a basic level of recycling service that includes collection, self-hauling, or other arrangements for the pickup of the recyclable materials
	 
	Subscribe to a recycling service which may include mixed waste processing that yields diversion results comparable to source separation

CSBA NOTE: In September 2020, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) determined, pursuant to Public Resources Code 42649.81, that the statewide disposal of organic waste has not been reduced to 50 percent of the 2014 level of disposal.   Thus, any school facility that generates two or more cubic yards per week of solid waste is required to meet requirements pertaining to the recycling of organic waste as described below.  CalRecyle's Frequently Asked Questions clarify that, for this purpose, the threshold applies to solid waste, recyclables, and organics.CalRecycle also extended the exemption in Public Resources Code 42649.81 and 42649.83 for rural jurisdictions that adopt a resolution as specified.  Districts in rural jurisdiction that have adopted such a resolution may delete the following paragraph.
Any school site or district facility which generates two or more cubic yards per week of solid waste, recyclables, and organics shall arrange for recycling services specifically for organic waste, including food waste, green waste, landscape and pruning waste, nonhazardous wood waste, and food-soiled paper waste that is mixed in with food waste.  Such facilities shall take at least one of the following actions:  (Public Resources Code 42649.8, 42649.81-42649.82, 42649.84)

	Source separate organic waste from other waste and subscribe to a basic level of organic waste recycling service that includes collection and recycling of organic waste
	 
	Recycle organic waste onsite or self-haul organic waste for recycling
	 
	Subscribe to an organic waste recycling service that may include mixed waste processing that specifically recycles organic waste
	 
	Make other arrangements to sell or donate recyclable organic waste materials

CSBA NOTE: Public Resources Code 42649.2 and 42649.81 require a school or other district facility that generates at least four cubic yards of solid waste or two cubic yards of organic waste per week to provide recycling bins or containers to collect material purchased on the premises.  According to CalRecycle's school poster, Recycling and Organics Recycling Guide for Schools, bins or containers must be placed where material is purchased on the premises for immediate consumption, such as areas where food is consumed.
Any school site or district facility that meets the above thresholds for solid or organic waste shall place a recycling bin or container for solid or organic waste, as applicable, in areas where food or other materials are purchased at the facility for immediate consumption.  The recycling bin or container shall be:  (Public Resources Code 42649.2, 42649.81)

	Adjacent to each bin or container for nonrecyclable trash, except in restrooms
	 
	Visible and easily accessible
	
	CSBA NOTE: Public Resources Code 42649.2 and 42649.81 require that each recycling bin or container be clearly marked with educational signage indicating what is appropriate to place in the bin or container.  CalRecycle provides customizable signage for this purpose on its web site, or districts may contact their local government or waste hauler for signage.
	Clearly marked with educational signage indicating appropriate items to be placed in the recycling bin or container in accordance with state law and the local jurisdiction's waste ordinances and practices
