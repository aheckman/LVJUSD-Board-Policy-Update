## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to promote the safety of students, staff, and the public while protecting District resources.  The Superintendent or designee shall establish a risk management program that uses effective safety and loss control practices.

The District shall strive to keep its liability at a minimum and its insurance premiums as low as possible while maintaining adequate protection against loss which may occur due to hazards facing the District.

To determine the most economical means of insuring the District consistent with required services, the Superintendent or designee shall annually review the District's options for obtaining coverage, including qualified insurance agents, a joint powers agency, self-insurance, or a combination of these means. Decisions regarding the means of insuring the District shall be based on a careful analysis of past claims records indicating the frequency and magnitude of losses and a prediction of future losses.

To minimize the District's exposure to liability, the Board shall adopt clear policies related to discrimination, harassment, safety procedures, and the timely handling of claims. The Superintendent or designee shall enforce these policies and related procedures fairly and consistently. The Superintendent or designee shall provide safety-related training and protective equipment to staff as appropriate for their position.

The Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Board on the District's risk management activities, including, but not limited to, the District's property and liability risks and exposures and the effectiveness of the District's risk management and loss control practices.
