CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy applies to solicitations by staff members for personal profit-making purposes.  For policy regarding solicitation on behalf of the school and other charitable organizations, see BP/AR 1321 - Solicitations of Funds from and by Students.  For policy regarding distribution of promotional materials to students and parents/guardians, see BP 1325 - Advertising and Promotion. Districts that authorize staff members to solicit sales from other staff members should modify the following paragraph accordingly.
Employees shall not solicit district staff, students or their families with the intent to sell general merchandise, books, equipment or services for their own personal profit or benefit.  Solicitation of students and staff on behalf of the school or other charitable organizations shall be conducted in accordance with applicable Board policy and administrative regulation.

Staff members shall respect the confidentiality of district employees and students and shall not use their status as district employees to secure information such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers for solicitations or use in personal profit-making or beneficial ventures.

Educational tours may be promoted on school premises only if they are sponsored by the district.  Employees engaged in planning, organizing or leading tours as private, non-district-sponsored businesses shall make it clear that they do not represent the school or district.  All activities related to such tours must be carried on outside of school hours and off school premises.

Staff participation in "flower funds," "anniversary funds" or other similar funds shall be voluntary.
