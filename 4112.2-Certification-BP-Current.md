## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Under the authority granted by Education Code 44252, the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) establishes standards and procedures for the issuance and renewal of multiple subject, single subject, education specialist, and other credentials, certificates, and permits and approves applications. Pursuant to Education Code 44251, a preliminary credential is generally valid for five years, during which time the employee must complete the requirements for the clear credential in order to continue to serve in a certificated position. The clear credential must be renewed every five years, but renewal does not require completion of additional coursework or service requirements.All candidates for a teaching credential must demonstrate proficiency in the subject matter area of the intended credential as specified in Education Code 44259. To implement statutory changes to the subject matter competence requirements pursuant to AB 130 (Ch. 44, Statutes of 2021), CTC has adopted 5 CCR 80096, which includes revisions based on the Office of Administrative Law's feedback; see CTC Coded Correspondence 22-06 for more information on the regulation.Assignment to certain positions within the district may require additional qualifications. For example, see AR 4112.22 - Staff Teaching English Learners, AR 4112.23 - Special Education Staff, and BP/AR 4113 - Assignment.
The Governing Board recognizes that the district's ability to provide a high-quality educational program is dependent upon the employment of certificated staff who are adequately prepared and have demonstrated proficiency in basic skills and competency in the subject matter to be taught. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that persons employed to fill positions requiring certification qualifications possess the appropriate credential, permit, or other certification document from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) and fulfill any additional state, federal, or district requirements for the position.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide assistance and support to teachers holding preliminary credentials to enable them to meet the qualifications required for the clear credential.

Priorities for Hiring Based on Unavailability of Credentialed Teacher

CSBA NOTE: To the extent possible, the district must hire a "fully prepared" teacher who holds a clear or preliminary teaching credential in the subject or setting of the assignment. The Governing Board may authorize a fully credentialed teacher to serve in an assignment outside the area authorized by the credential if specified criteria are met; see BP/AR 4113 - Assignment and CTC's, "Assignment Resources," available on its web site. Education Code 44225.7 permits the district to hire a candidate who is not a fully credentialed teacher in accordance with the hiring hierarchy provided in Items #1-3 below if the Board has adopted an annual resolution that it has made reasonable efforts to recruit a fully prepared teacher for the assignment.
The Superintendent or designee shall make reasonable efforts to recruit a fully prepared teacher who is authorized in the subject or setting for each assignment or, when necessary, a fully prepared teacher serving on a local assignment option. Whenever a teacher with a clear or preliminary credential is not available, and the Board adopts a resolution that it has made reasonable efforts to recruit a fully prepared teacher for the assignment, the Superintendent or designee shall make reasonable efforts to recruit an individual for the assignment in the following order:  (Education Code 44225.7)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44225.7, if a credentialed teacher is not available, priority for employment must be given to an individual who is enrolled in an approved internship program, as provided in Item #1 below. CTC Coded Correspondence 13-01 clarifies that such an individual must possess a CTC-issued intern credential.


	A candidate who enrolls in an approved internship program in the region of the district and possesses an intern credential
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44225.7, next priority for filling a position should be for a candidate who is scheduled to complete preliminary credential requirements within six months, as provided in Item #2 below. CTC Coded Correspondence 13-01 clarifies that such an individual must qualify for and obtain a provisional internship permit (PIP) or short-term staff permit (STSP).Pursuant to 5 CCR 80021-80021.1, the district may employ persons with a PIP when the district has conducted a diligent search but has been unable to recruit a credentialed teacher, or an STSP when needed to immediately staff classrooms based on unforeseen circumstances. Each of these options requires the district to provide orientation, training, and/or guidance; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
	A candidate who is scheduled to complete preliminary credential requirements within six months and who is granted a provisional internship permit (PIP) or short-term staff permit issued by CTC
	
	CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 80021.1 requires that a notice of intent to employ a person with a PIP be made public as described in the following paragraph. A copy of the agenda item and the Superintendent or designee's verification of the Board's favorable action must be included as part of the application to the CTC along with other required verifications; see the accompanying administrative regulation.The Board shall take action to approve, at an open Board meeting, a notice of its intent to employ a PIP applicant for a specific position.  (5 CCR 80021.1)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44225.7, when the district is unable to recruit a credentialed teacher or a teacher who meets the qualifications specified in Items #1-2 above, it may request CTC to approve the assignment of a person who does not meet those criteria. According to CTC Coded Correspondence 13-01, such an individual would need to qualify for a "variable term waiver." For further information about variable term waivers, see 5 CCR 80125 and CTC's, "Waiver Requests Guidebook".
	An individual who has been granted a credential waiver by CTC

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 80023.2, 80026, and 80027-80027.1, the Board must annually approve a Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators prior to hiring a person with an emergency permit or a limited assignment permit to teach outside the area of certification. The form for the Declaration of Need is available on CTC's web site. Pursuant to 5 CCR 80026, the Declaration of Need must be approved at a regularly scheduled public Board meeting and is valid for up to 12 months, expiring on June 30 following its submission to CTC.
Annually, the Board shall, prior to requesting that CTC issue an emergency permit or limited assignment permit, approve a Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators. The Declaration of Need shall be approved by the Board as an action item at a regularly scheduled open Board meeting, with the entire Declaration of Need being included in the Board agenda  (Education Code 44225, 44225.7; 5 CCR 80023.2, 80026, 80027, 80027.1)

The Declaration of Need shall certify that there is an insufficient number of certificated persons who meet the district's specified employment criteria for the position(s) and that the district has made reasonable efforts to recruit individuals who meet the qualifications specified in Items #1-2 above. The Declaration of Need shall also indicate the number and type of emergency permits and limited assigned permits that the district estimates it will need during the valid period of the Declaration of Need, based on the previous year's actual needs and projections of enrollment. It shall also specify each subject to be listed on the General Education Limited Assignment Single Subject Teaching Permits and the target language on Emergency Bilingual Permits. Whenever the actual number of permits needed exceeds the estimate by 10 percent, the Board shall revise and resubmit the Declaration of Need.  (5 CCR 80026)

Whenever it is necessary to employ noncredentialed teachers to fill a position requiring certification qualifications, the Superintendent or designee shall provide support and guidance in accordance with law to ensure the quality of the instructional program.

National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) offers teachers a voluntary, rigorous advanced certification process to improve their practice as educators. Districts can encourage teacher participation by coordinating a cohort of teachers through school or district-based programs, their county office of education, or the NBPTS Resource Center at Stanford University or other NBPTS support networks. A list of current NBPTS support networks can be found on the NBPTS web site.Additionally, the California NBPTS provides grants to districts through the NBPTS Incentive Program, for the purpose of providing incentives to teachers who have attained certification from NBPTS and agree to teach at a high-priority school for at least five years, and teachers who initiate the process of pursuing a NBPTS certification when teaching at a high-priority school. Pursuant to Education Code 44395, as amended by AB 181 (Ch. 52, Statutes of 2022), grants for teachers who have attained certification will be disbursed from the California Department of Education (CDE), and funds that are unused for teachers initiating the program are required to be applied to future candidates; see CDE's web site for more information.Districts and schools may use U.S. Department of Education grant funds (e.g., Title I, Part A; Title II, Part A; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Part B), as well as district resources for beginning teachers, for costs associated with teachers pursuing, achieving, and maintaining National Board certification.
The Superintendent or designee shall promote a career continuum that includes participation of district teachers in professional learning that supports their completion of advanced certification awarded by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS). The Superintendent or designee may coordinate a cohort of teachers through school or district programs or other available networks.

With Board approval and funding, and consistent with the collective bargaining agreement and applicable law, the Superintendent may provide an incentive program for teacher participation in NBPTS certification, which may include:

	Defraying, subsidizing, or reimbursing the registration, certification, or maintenance fees for NBPTS certification
	 
	Providing bonuses, step increases, or differential pay for teachers who maintain their certification and continue to teach in the district, with priority given to teachers at Title I schools and schools serving a majority of low-income students
	 
	Providing substitute teachers to provide release time for participating teachers
	 
	Providing stipends for teacher participation that match other professional development stipends
	 
	Compensating mentor teachers who support other teachers' professional learning aligned to NBPTS standards

Parental Notifications

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that receive federal Title I funds, and may be used or adapted by other districts at their discretion.20 USC 6312 requires districts receiving federal Title I funds to provide the following annual notification to parents/guardians of students in any school receiving Title I funds. Such districts may choose to provide the same notification to all schools, regardless of whether they receive Title I funds.
At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the parents/guardians of each student attending a school receiving Title I funds that they may request information regarding the professional qualifications of their child's classroom teacher including, but not limited to, whether the teacher:  (20 USC 6312)

	Has met state qualification and licensing criteria for the grade levels and subject areas in which the teacher provides instruction
	 
	Is teaching under emergency or other provisional status through which state qualification or licensing criteria have been waived
	 
	Is teaching in the field of discipline of the teacher's certification

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians in a timely manner whenever their child has been assigned, or has been taught for four or more consecutive weeks by, a teacher who does not meet applicable state certification or licensure requirements at the grade level and subject area to which the teacher has been assigned.  (20 USC 6312)

<br>
<div id='MMg18' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) offers teachers a voluntary, rigorous advanced certification process to improve their practice as educators. Districts can encourage teacher participation by coordinating a cohort of teachers through school or district-based programs, their county office of education, or the NBPTS Resource Center at Stanford University or other NBPTS support networks. A list of current NBPTS support networks can be found on the NBPTS web site.<br><br>Additionally, the California NBPTS provides grants to districts through the NBPTS Incentive Program, for the purpose of providing incentives to teachers who have attained certification from NBPTS and agree to teach at a high-priority school for at least five years, and teachers who initiate the process of pursuing a NBPTS certification when teaching at a high-priority school. Pursuant to Education Code 44395, as amended by AB 181 (Ch. 52, Statutes of 2022), grants for teachers who have attained certification will be disbursed from the California Department of Education (CDE), and funds that are unused for teachers initiating the program are required to be applied to future candidates; see CDE's web site for more information.<br><br>Districts and schools may use U.S. Department of Education grant funds (e.g., Title I, Part A; Title II, Part A; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Part B), as well as district resources for beginning teachers, for costs associated with teachers pursuing, achieving, and maintaining National Board certification.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MTcxOA7" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MTcxOA7%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22MMg18%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1686610936%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20following%20optional%20section%20may%20be%20revised%20to%20reflect%20district%20practice.%20The%20National%20Board%20for%20Professional%20Teaching%20Standards%20%28NBPTS%29%20offers%20teachers%20a%20voluntary%2C%20rigorous%20advanced%20certification%20process%20to%20improve%20their%20practice%20as%20educators.%20Districts%20can%20encourage%20teacher%20participation%20by%20coordinating%20a%20cohort%20of%20teachers%20through%20school%20or%20district-based%20programs%2C%20their%20county%20office%20of%20education%2C%20or%20the%20NBPTS%20Resource%20Center%20at%20Stanford%20University%20or%20other%20NBPTS%20support%20networks.%20A%20list%20of%20current%20NBPTS%20support%20networks%20can%20be%20found%20on%20the%20NBPTS%20web%20site.%5Cn%5CnAdditionally%2C%20the%20California%20NBPTS%20provides%20grants%20to%20districts%20through%20the%20NBPTS%20Incentive%20Program%2C%20for%20the%20purpose%20of%20providing%20incentives%20to%20teachers%20who%20have%20attained%20certification%20from%20NBPTS%20and%20agree%20to%20teach%20at%20a%20high-priority%20school%20for%20at%20least%20five%20years%2C%20and%20teachers%20who%20initiate%20the%20process%20of%20pursuing%20a%20NBPTS%20certification%20when%20teaching%20at%20a%20high-priority%20school.%20Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2044395%2C%20as%20amended%20by%20AB%20181%20%28Ch.%2052%2C%20Statutes%20of%202022%29%2C%20grants%20for%20teachers%20who%20have%20attained%20certification%20will%20be%20disbursed%20from%20the%20California%20Department%20of%20Education%20%28CDE%29%2C%20and%20funds%20that%20are%20unused%20for%20teachers%20initiating%20the%20program%20are%20required%20to%20be%20applied%20to%20future%20candidates%3B%20see%20CDE%27s%20web%20site%20for%20more%20information.%5Cn%5CnDistricts%20and%20schools%20may%20use%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Education%20grant%20funds%20%28e.g.%2C%20Title%20I%2C%20Part%20A%3B%20Title%20II%2C%20Part%20A%3B%20Individuals%20with%20Disabilities%20Education%20Act%2C%20Part%20B%29%2C%20as%20well%20as%20district%20resources%20for%20beginning%20teachers%2C%20for%20costs%20associated%20with%20teachers%20pursuing%2C%20achieving%2C%20and%20maintaining%20National%20Board%20certification.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MTcxOA7" title="CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be r..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
