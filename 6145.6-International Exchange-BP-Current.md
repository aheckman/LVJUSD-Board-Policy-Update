## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that maintain secondary schools and accept enrollment of international students through approved programs sponsored by an International Student Exchange Placement Organization (ISEPO).The policy does not apply to students who may otherwise meet district residency requirements for school attendance or to students whose parents/guardians were California residents who departed against their will, as defined in Education Code 48204.4. See AR 5111.1 - District Residency.
The Governing Board recognizes the value of interactions between students of different countries and cultures in promoting global awareness and international understanding in an increasingly globalized and interconnected world.  The Board welcomes the enrollment of international exchange students in district schools and encourages district students to take advantage of opportunities that they may have to participate in such programs and study in another country.

With Board approval, a district school may establish a sister-school relationship with a school in another country.

District Students Studying in Another Country

School counselors may provide information regarding international exchange programs and academic counseling to district students who wish to study in a foreign country.  Such counseling shall include a review of the student's completed coursework, academic achievement, and personal goals, and shall advise the student regarding requirements that the student must meet during attendance in the foreign school in order to maintain progress toward meeting district graduation requirements.

Credit for courses successfully completed in the foreign country shall be granted in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation.

International Exchange Students in District Schools

CSBA NOTE:  Government Code 12623 requires that any organization that arranges for the placement of international exchange students in California schools first be registered with the Attorney General's Office.Pursuant to Education Code 35185, a district is authorized to request proof of the registration as a condition to enrolling a student.For the protection of students and to reduce district liability, CSBA strongly recommends that districts check to see if a student placement organization is registered in California by reviewing the Registry List maintained by the Attorney General's Registry of International Student Exchange Visitor Placement Organizations. See CSBA's Legal Guidance Regarding International Student Exchange Placement Organizations for additional recommendations and best practices.In addition, the Council for Standards for International Educational Travel (CSIET), a nonprofit organization whose purpose is to identify reputable international exchange programs, annually develops an Advisory List identifying exchange organizations that fully, provisionally, or conditionally meet CSIET standards related to financial responsibility, student selection, student orientation, and the placement process.It is the responsibility of the ISEPO to confirm the eligibility of international students for the exchange program. To be eligible, secondary students must (1) have a J-1 or F-1 visa; (2) not have previously attended school in the United States through an exchange program or on a J-1 or F-1 visa; and (3) either have not completed more than 11 years of primary and secondary study in their home country, excluding kindergarten, or be at least 15 years of age but not more than 18 years and six months of age as of the program start date.The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that wish to only accept students participating in programs designated by the Attorney General's Office.
Before enrolling an international exchange student in a district school, the Superintendent or designee shall request proof that the student is participating in an International Student Exchange Placement Organization (ISEPO) program registered with the California Attorney General's Office.

The Superintendent or designee shall obtain from the ISEPO a description of the services to be performed by the ISEPO for the student, host family, and the district; telephone numbers that the student, host family, or district may contact for assistance; and a summary of the student's complete prior academic coursework completed.  (Government Code 12628; 22 CFR 62.25)

The district may require additional documents which may include, but are not limited to, evidence that the student has health and accident insurance from the time of departure from home to the time the student returns to the home country.  (11 CCR 360; 22 CFR 62.25)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be used by districts that wish to limit the total number of international exchange students admitted into the district.
When necessary because of overcrowding within district schools or limited district resources, the Superintendent or designee may limit the number of international exchange students to be accepted at any district high school during any school year.

The district shall not incur any financial obligation when educating international exchange students. An international student, or the ISEPO on behalf of the student, shall reimburse the district for the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of providing education at a district school for the period of the visiting student's attendance.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be modified to reflect district practice. Federal and state law do not specify a formula for calculating the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of providing education to an international student for the purpose of determining the tuition that will be charged. Education Code 48052 identifies factors that must be considered in determining the total cost of educating a student who resides in a foreign country adjacent to California, which, for consistency, may also serve as a basis for calculating tuition for international students.Alternatively, as described in CSBA's Legal Guidance Regarding International Student Exchange Placement Organizations, the district could use the per student amount of the high school base grant provided to districts under the local control funding formula, which could be augmented by the amount received by the district for separately funded categorical programs and any federal funding received by the district, or could consider its prior year per student expenditures.It is recommended that districts consult with legal counsel in determining such a formula.
In determining the tuition for international exchange students, the district shall calculate the total cost of educating the student, including, but not limited to, the amount expended per student for the current provision of instruction and services, the use of buildings and equipment, the repayment of local bonds and interest payments and state building loan funds, capital outlay, and transportation to and from school.

The Superintendent or designee shall establish district criteria for issuing regular or honorary diplomas to international exchange students.  The principal or designee shall refer to these criteria when assisting international exchange students in selecting classes and cocurricular activities based on the student's individual qualifications, needs, and interests.
