## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy pertains to political activities of individual employees acting on their own behalf as well as employee organizations. Employees engaging in political activities on behalf of the district are subject to legal limitations as discussed in BP 1160 - Political Processes. For any portion of the district's educational program that includes instruction related to political philosophy or activities which may be controversial in nature, see the accompanying administrative regulation and BP 6144 - Controversial Issues.The First Amendment generally prohibits districts from disciplining an employee because of the employee's engagement in constitutionally protected political activity.  In Pickering v. Board of Education Township High School District, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a teacher may not be dismissed for exercising the right to speak on issues of public importance, including criticisms of the board and superintendent, without proof of false statements made knowingly or recklessly. However, an employee may be disciplined if the speech impedes the employee's proper performance of daily duties or interferes with the regular operation of the schools.Districts should be careful that employee discipline does not amount to retaliation in response to the exercise of free speech protected by the First Amendment, and are encouraged to consult legal counsel as appropriate.
The Governing Board recognizes the importance of political activity, voting, and civic engagement, and respects the right of district employees to engage in political discussions and activities as individuals on their own time and at their own expense. When engaging in such activities, employees shall make it clear that they are acting on their own behalf and not as representatives of the district.

District employees, as members of the community, may use school facilities for meetings, including political activities, as permitted under the Civic Center Act and district policy.

Employees shall refrain from prohibited political activities identified in law, Board policy, and administrative regulations. Employees who engage in these activities shall be subject to disciplinary action and/or criminal penalties.
