CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54957.7, whenever the Governing Board holds a closed session, it must reconvene in open session following the closed session to report on its actions, either orally or in writing, and make any disclosures required by law; see the accompanying Board Bylaw. The language offered below is intended to follow the specific reporting requirements found in law. Where the law does not specifically address the reporting of a closed session item, the following language is designed to inform the public of the Board's action without breaching confidentiality. Language in parentheses is for informational purposes only and should not be included as part of the general description of an item.

Following a closed session during any Governing Board meeting, the Board shall reconvene in open session to present, orally or in writing, a report of any of the following actions taken during the closed session, as applicable:

Personnel Matters

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54957.1 requires the Board to publicly report any closed session action taken to appoint, employ, dismiss, accept the resignation of, or otherwise affect the employment status of a district employee.
