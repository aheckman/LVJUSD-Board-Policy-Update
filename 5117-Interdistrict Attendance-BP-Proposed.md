## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that parents/guardians ofstudents who reside within the geographic boundaries of one district may, for a variety of reasons, desire to enroll their children in a school in another district.

The Board understands the importance of supporting students and their families when it comes to making a decision about where to attend school. Unnecessary obstacles should not prevent a student from leaving or entering our local District.

Interdistrict Attendance Applications

The agreement shall specify the terms and conditions under which interdistrict attendance shall be permitted or denied. It also may contain standards agreed to by both districts for reapplication and/or revocation of the student's permit. (Education Code 46600)

Upon receiving an application for transfer into the District that has been approved by the student's district of residence, the Superintendent or designee shall review the request and may approve or deny the application subject to the terms and conditions of the interdistrict attendance agreement.

Upon parent/guardian request, the District shall provide transportation assistance to a student receiving an interdistrict transfer who is eligible for free and reduced-price meals and is the child of an active duty military parent/guardian or a victim of bullying, as defined in Education Code 46600. (Education Code 46600)
