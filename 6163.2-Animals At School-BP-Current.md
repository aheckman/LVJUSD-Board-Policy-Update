## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 28 CFR 35.136, as amended by 75 Fed. Reg. 178, a district is mandated to modify its policies, practices, and procedures to permit an individual with a disability to use a service animal at school, when the work or task performed by the service animal is directly related to the individual's disability. See the accompanying administrative regulation for language reflecting this mandate. 
The Governing Board recognizes that animals can contribute to the district's instructional program by being effective teaching aids to students and by assisting individuals with disabilities to access district programs and activities.  In addition, instruction related to the care and treatment of animals teaches students a sense of responsibility and promotes the humane treatment of living creatures.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop rules and procedures to ensure that when animals are brought to school, the health, safety, and welfare of students, staff, and the animals are protected.  However, the district assumes no liability for the safety of animals allowed on district property.
