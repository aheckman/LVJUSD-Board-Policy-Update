## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional bylaw may be revised to reflect district practice.  This bylaw addresses the establishment and operation of Governing Board subcommittees consisting of less than a quorum of the Board and other standing and advisory committees created by the Board. See BP/AR 1220 - Citizen Advisory Committees for further information about committees that include members of the community and/or stakeholder groups, including examples of citizen advisory committees that are generally created by formal Board action.  For information about committees created by the Superintendent or designee to advise the administration, see BP 2230 - Representative and Deliberative Groups.
The Governing Board may establish a committee whenever it determines that such a committee would benefit the district by providing diverse viewpoints, specialized knowledge or expertise, or increased efficiency.  Such committees may be subcommittees of the Board or committees that include members of the community, staff, or other stakeholder groups.

Upon establishing a committee, the Board shall clearly define the committee's purpose, any timeline for completion of assigned responsibilities, any stakeholder groups or individuals to be represented on the committee, length of time that committee members are expected to serve, and expectations for reporting to the Board and/or the Superintendent or designee.  Unless specifically authorized by the Board to act on its behalf, the committee shall act in an advisory capacity.

Except for subcommittees of the Board, committee members shall, as appropriate, be recommended by the Superintendent or designee and appointed by the Board president, subject to Board approval.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide committee members with information and assistance necessary for the fulfillment of the committee's charges, and may serve as a non-voting advisor to the committee at the discretion of the Board.

Whenever so charged, committees may actively seek input and participation by parents/guardians, staff, community, and students and may consult with local public boards and agencies.

Any committee not required by law may be dissolved when its duties or term has been completed or whenever the Board deems necessary.

Committee Meetings

CSBA NOTE: Unless otherwise exempted by law, Government Code 54952 provides that open meeting laws (the Brown Act) apply to any commission, committee, board, or other legislative body created by formal action of the Board, regardless of whether that body is permanent or temporary, decision making or advisory; also see BP/AR 1220 - Citizen Advisory Committees. These requirements include posting a meeting notice or agenda at least 72 hours before a regular meeting or 24 hours before a special meeting pursuant to Government Code 54954.2 and 54956; see BB 9320 - Meetings and Notices.In Frazer v. Dixon Unified School District, the court held that the adoption of a Board policy that required the appointment of a curriculum committee to advise the Superintendent, and in turn the Board, was a committee created by "formal Board action" within the meaning of Government Code 54952. Therefore, the committee's meetings were subject to the Brown Act.The district should consult legal counsel when questions arise regarding the applicability of Brown Act requirements to district or school committees.
Unless otherwise exempted by law, Board-created committees shall provide public notice of their meetings and conduct meetings in accordance with Government Code 54950-54963 (the Brown Act).

However, Board subcommittees composed solely of less than a quorum of the members of the Board are not subject to open meeting laws unless they are standing committees. Standing committees of the Board, irrespective of membership, are those that have a continuing subject matter jurisdiction or a meeting schedule established by action of the Board.  (Government Code 54952)

CSBA NOTE: In 79 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 69 (1996), the Attorney General has clarified that open meeting laws apply if the standing committee has the responsibility of providing advice at the Board's request on budgets, audits, contracts, and personnel matters.
Standing committees with a continuing subject matter jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, those responsible for providing advice on budgets, audits, Board policy, contracts, and personnel matters at the Board's request.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54952.2, the Brown Act is not violated if Board members who are not members of a standing committee attend the committee meeting only as "observers." In 81 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 156 (1998), the Attorney General clarified that those Board members attending the meeting as "observers" may not ask questions or make statements at the meeting and that they must sit in the areas designated for members of the public.
When a majority of the members of the Board attend an open and noticed meeting of a standing committee, the Board members who are not members of the standing committee shall attend only as observers.  (Government Code 54952.2)

Whenever any advisory or standing committee, including a committee not otherwise subject to the Brown Act, posts a meeting agenda at least 72 hours in advance of the meeting, that meeting shall be considered as a regular meeting of the Board for purposes of the Brown Act and therefore must be held within district boundaries unless otherwise authorized by law. (Government Code 54954)

CSBA NOTE: In 80 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 308 (1997), the Attorney General determined that sessions of a district liaison council that was formed by the board to interview candidates for district superintendent and to make a recommendation to the board were not required to be open to the public.  The Attorney General concluded that, because a legislative body is authorized under Government Code 54957 to hold closed sessions during a regular or special meeting to consider the appointment or employment of a public employee (see BB 9321 - Closed Session Purposes and Agendas), that authority also extends to committees that are delegated by the legislative body to perform related duties.  The following paragraph reflects this opinion.In addition, in 92 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 102, the Attorney General concluded that a joint labor management benefits committee that is a product of the collective bargaining process between labor and management and is implemented in a collective bargaining agreement is not a committee created by the board. Therefore, such a committee is not required to comply with the Brown Act and is authorized to hold closed sessions.
Committees may meet in a closed session during a regular or special meeting only for those purposes specifically authorized by law for closed sessions held by the Board.
