## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the importance of creating a work environment that encourages employee innovation in creating and developing high-quality materials to improve student achievement and the efficiency of District operations. 

The Superintendent or designee shall oversee the development of instructional materials, computer programs, and other copyrightable materials by employees, independent contractors, and consultants.  An employee, independent contractor, or consultant shall notify the Superintendent or designee of his/her intent to publish or register a work developed in whole or in part within the scope of his/her employment. 

Instructional materials, computer programs, and other copyrightable materials developed by an employee within the scope of his/her employment shall be the property of the District.

If an employee has developed copyrightable material during both work and non-working hours, and the work was within the scope of his/her employment, the Superintendent or designee shall negotiate a contract with the employee to protect the District's right as to the ownership or partial ownership of the copyright. 

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any contract with an independent contractor or consultant contains a provision specifying the District's right to ownership of the copyright of any work produced by the contractor or consultant for the District.

The Superintendent or designee may secure copyrights in the name of the District for all copyrightable works developed by the District.  All royalties or revenues from these copyrights shall be used for the benefit of the District.  (Education Code 35170)
