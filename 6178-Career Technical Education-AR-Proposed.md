## Policy Content

Federal Grants for Career Technical Education (Perkins)

The District shall submit to the California Department of Education an application for a basic grant of the federal Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. The application shall address the components specified in 20 USC 2354 and any additional requirements specified in the state plan developed pursuant to 20 USC 2342.  (20 USC 2354)

The District shall conduct a needs assessment in accordance with 20 USC 2354, which shall be updated at least once every two years.  The needs assessment shall be conducted in consultation with representatives of District career technical education (CTE) programs, postsecondary CTE programs, state or local workforce development boards and businesses, parents/guardians, students, and other specified stakeholders.  (20 USC 2354)

To meet the needs identified in the needs assessment, the Superintendent or designee shall develop, coordinate, implement, or improve CTE programs that are of sufficient size, scope, and quality to be effective and that fulfill the following purposes:  (20 USC 2355)

	Provide career exploration and career development activities through an organized, systematic framework designed to aid students, including students in the middle grades, in making informed plans and decisions about future education and career opportunities and programs of study. Such activities shall occur before students enroll and while they are participating in a CTE program, and may include:
	 
	
		Introductory courses or activities focused on career exploration and career awareness, including non-traditional fields
		 
		Readily available career and labor market information, including information on occupational supply and demand, educational requirements, other information on careers aligned to economic priorities, and employment sectors
		 
		Programs and activities related to the development of student graduation and career plans
		 
		Career guidance and academic counselors who provide information on postsecondary education and career options
		 
		Any other activity that advances knowledge of career opportunities and assists students in making informed decisions about future education and employment goals, including nontraditional fields
		 
		Activities that provide students with strong experience in, and comprehensive understanding of, all aspects of an industry
		 
	
	
	Provide the skills necessary to pursue careers in high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand industry sectors or occupations
	 
	Integrate academic skills into CTE programs and programs of study to support participating students in meeting state academic standards
	 
	Provide professional development for teachers, school leaders, administrators, specialized instructional support personnel, guidance counselors, and/or paraprofessionals, which may include the types of activities listed in 20 USC 2355
	 
	Plan and carry out elements that support the implementation of CTE programs and programs of study and that result in increased student achievement. Such elements may include curriculum aligned with program requirements, sustainable relationships among community stakeholders, opportunities for students to participate in accelerated learning programs, equipment and instructional materials aligned with business and industry needs, and other activities specified in 20 USC 2355.
	 
	Develop and implement evaluations of the activities funded by the grant

The District's program shall provide activities to prepare special populations for high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand industry sectors or occupations that will lead to self-sufficiency. Special populations shall be provided with equal access to CTE programs and shall not be unlawfully discriminated against.  Special populations include, but are not limited to, students with disabilities, students from economically disadvantaged families, pregnant and parenting students, out-of-work individuals, English learners, homeless students, foster youth, children of military families, and students preparing for nontraditional fields. Nontraditional fields include occupations or fields of work, including careers in computer science, technology, and other emerging high-skill occupations, for which individuals from one gender constitute less than 25 percent of the individuals employed in each such occupation or field of work.  (20 USC 2302, 2354, 2373)

Upon written request from a nonprofit private school within the geographical area served by the District, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with private school representatives in a timely and meaningful manner and may provide for the participation of private school secondary students in the District's programs and activities funded pursuant to 20 USC 2301-2414. To the extent practicable, the Superintendent or designee shall also, upon request, permit participation of CTE teachers, administrators, and other personnel from private schools in the District's inservice and preservice professional development programs funded through such grants.  (20 USC 2397)

Partnership Academies

The District shall operate one or more partnership academies as a school-within-a-school focused on a broad career theme. The program shall be available to students in grades 10-12, at least half of whom shall be students who are at risk of dropping out of school as indicated by three or more of the following criteria:  (Education Code 54690-54691)

	Past record of irregular attendance, with absence from school 20 percent or more of the school year
	 
	Past record of underachievement in which the student is at least one-third of a year behind the coursework for the respective grade level, or as demonstrated by credits achieved
	 
	Past record of low motivation or disinterest in the regular school program
	 
	Economic disadvantage
	 
	Scores below basic or far below basic on the mathematics or English language arts test of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress
	 
	A grade point average of 2.2 or below or the equivalent of a C minus

Ninth-grade teachers and counselors shall identify students eligible to participate in a partnership academy. Participating students shall be selected by academy staff from among those who have expressed an interest in the academy and whose parents/guardians have approved the student's participation.  (Education Code 54695)

The District's program shall provide:  (Education Code 54692)

	During each regular school term, instruction in at least three academic subjects that:
	 
	
		Prepares students for a regular high school diploma
		 
		Where possible and appropriate, prepares students to meet subject requirements for admission to UC and CSU
		 
		Contributes to an understanding of the occupational field of the academy
		 
	
	
	CTE or science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses offered at each grade level at the academy that are part of an occupational course sequence that targets comprehensive skills and meets the criteria specified in Education Code 54692
	 
	Classes that are block scheduled in a cluster whenever possible to provide flexibility to academy teachers and which may vary in number during grade 12
	 
	A mentor from the business community for students during grade 11
	 
	An employer-based internship or work experience that occurs during the summer following grade 11 or during grade 12
	 
	Additional motivational activities with private sector involvement to encourage academic and occupational preparation

Attendance in academy classes shall be limited to students enrolled in the academy.  (Education Code 54692)

The Superintendent or designee shall establish an advisory committee consisting of individuals involved in academy operations, including District and school administrators, lead teachers, and representatives of the private sector.  (Education Code 54692)

Apprenticeship Programs

The District shall offer high school and/or adult education students a program of orientation to apprenticeships that acquaints students with a broad range of career options, provides information regarding available apprenticeship programs, and provides classroom instructional job training which guides students to a registered apprenticeable occupation.

The District's program shall:

	Introduce students to what they need to know in order to apply, test, and interview for acceptance into an apprenticeship program
	 
	Demonstrate the need for proficiency in reading and comprehension, mathematics, science, and technology
	 
	Emphasize the necessity to have the ability to communicate in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and numeration skills
	 
	Identify the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to enter and successfully complete an apprenticeship program
	 
	Provide an orientation to a specific craft or trade or to an industry

The District may enter into an agreement with a local business, labor or management apprenticeship committee, and/or joint labor-management apprenticeship committee that has been approved by the Department of Industrial Relations' Division of Apprenticeship Standards to sponsor an apprenticeship program in order to develop and deliver related and supplemental instruction to students participating in a registered apprenticeship program.  (Education Code 8150-8155; Labor Code 3074, 3075, 3078)

Regional Occupational Center/Program

The District shall operate and/or partner with a regional occupational center or program (ROC/P), established pursuant to Education Code 52335.12, which offers CTE courses, linked learning programs, partnership academies, and/or pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs as appropriate.

Occupational course sequences offered by ROC/P shall provide prerequisite courses needed to enter apprenticeship or postsecondary vocational certificate or degree programs, focus on occupations requiring comprehensive skills leading to high entry-level wages and/or the possibility of significant wage increases after a few years on the job, offer as many courses as possible that meet college admission requirements, and lead to attainment of an occupational skill certificate.  (Education Code 52302)

Student Organizations

The District may provide support, including supplies, materials, activities, and advisor expenses, to student organizations which engage in activities that are integral to the CTE program and provide for the development of student leadership skills.  However, no state or federal funds shall be used to pay students' membership dues, food or lodging expenses, out-of-state travel, or the cost of a social activity or assemblage.
