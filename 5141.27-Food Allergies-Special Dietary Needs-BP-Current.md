## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board desires to prevent students' exposure to foods to which they are allergic or intolerant and to provide for prompt and appropriate treatment in the event that a severe allergic reaction occurs at school.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop guidelines for the care of food-allergic students. Such guidelines shall include, but are not limited to, strategies for identifying students at risk for allergic reactions, avoidance measures, education of staff regarding typical symptoms, and actions to be taken in the event of a severe allergic reaction.

Parents/guardians shall be responsible for notifying the Superintendent or designee, in writing, regarding any food allergies or other special dietary needs of their child in accordance with administrative regulation.

CSBA NOTE: If a student's food allergy or food intolerance substantially limits one or more major life activities, the student may be considered "disabled" in accordance with Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act (29 USC 794), even if he/she does not require services pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 USC 1400-1482). For Section 504 purposes, the definitions of "disability" and "substantially limits" contained in 42 USC 12102, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008, require that a determination of disability be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. For example, if a student has a severe allergy that is managed through allergy shots, frequent hand washing, bringing a lunch from home, or other measures, he/she may still be considered disabled under Section 504 if the allergy would substantially limit a major life activity without those mitigating measures. The district would need to evaluate the student to determine if he/she has a disability and to develop an accommodation plan if necessary. See BP/AR 6164.6 - Identification and Education Under Section 504.The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), in its January 2012 Dear Colleague Letter and accompanying Questions and Answers on ADA Amendments Act of 2008 for Students with Disabilities Attending Public Elementary and Secondary Schools, clarifies that under the new rules, many students with allergies would be considered to have a disability because their allergies are likely to substantially limit the major life activities of breathing and respiratory function without mitigating measures. Furthermore, an existing individualized health care plan may be insufficient if it does not comply with current Section 504 requirements for evaluation, placement, and procedural safeguards. Some regional offices of OCR have taken the position that a Section 504 plan is required because of the inherent danger that can result from an allergic reaction.The types of accommodations that may be considered reasonable vary depending on the individual needs of the student and the severity of the allergy. The National School Boards Association's Legal and Practical Issues Relating to Accommodating Students with Peanut Allergies cites cases in which the accommodations imposed by administrative hearing officers ranged from providing an allergy-free table in the cafeteria to banning peanuts in a classroom.
When a student's food allergy or food intolerance substantially limits one or more major life activities, his/her parents/guardians shall be informed of the district's obligation to evaluate the student to determine if he/she requires accommodations pursuant to Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act. The student shall be evaluated in accordance with law and the procedures specified in AR 6164.6 - Identification and Education Under Section 504.  If that process results in the development of a Section 504 plan, the district shall provide the accommodations and/or aids and services identified in the plan.

If a student's diet restrictions and needed services are addressed in an individualized education program (IEP), the Superintendent or designee shall ensure compliance with the IEP including any necessary food substitutions.

CSBA NOTE: Section 504 and other federal and state laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. If an allergic student is determined to be "disabled" as discussed above, he/she is entitled to protection under the nondiscrimination provisions of Section 504, even if he/she does not need any special education or related services as a result of the allergy. In addition, Education Code 234.1 requires districts to adopt a process for receiving and investigating student complaints involving discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on specified characteristics, including disability; see AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.
Students shall not be excluded from school activities nor otherwise discriminated against, harassed, intimidated, or bullied because of their food allergy.

Any complaint of alleged noncompliance with this policy shall be addressed through appropriate district complaint procedures.

The district's food services program may, but is not required to, accommodate individual student preferences or diets that are not supported by a statement from the student's health care provider.
