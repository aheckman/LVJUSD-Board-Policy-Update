## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that maintain high schools and should be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 51225.3 requires the Governing Board to adopt alternative means for students to complete the prescribed course of study required for high school graduation as specified in BP 6146.1 - High School Graduation Requirements. 
In order to meet individual student needs and encourage all students to complete their high school education, the Governing Board desires to provide flexibility in the completion of prescribed courses in accordance with law.

With the active involvement of parents/guardians, administrators, teachers, and students, the Board shall adopt alternative means for students to complete the prescribed course of study required for high school graduation. These alternative means shall be made available to students, parents/guardians, and the public.  (Education Code 51225.3)

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-12 below are optional. The district should select those items that reflect alternative means adopted by the Board and/or expand the list to add other means adopted by the Board.
Students may fulfill any course requirement for graduation through the following:

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.3 authorizes students to satisfy course requirements through practical demonstration of skills and competencies, as provided in item #1 below. However, on its web site, the California Department of Education (CDE) indicates that the General Educational Development (GED) test administered pursuant to Education Code 51420-51427 is prohibited as an alternative means of satisfying course requirements; this prohibition is based on a policy of the national GED Testing Service. In addition, although the use of the California High School Proficiency Examination or other state or national tests is not expressly prohibited for these purposes, the CDE advises that such tests may not be aligned with district courses and are not intended for this use. The paragraph under item #1 below is optional.

	Practical demonstration of skills and competencies  (Education Code 51225.3)
	
	Opportunities to demonstrate skills and competencies shall include, but not be limited to, challenging a course through successful completion of a district-developed examination which covers course objectives.  The district shall not use results from the General Educational Development test or other state or national tests for this purpose.
	
	CSBA NOTE: If the district offers work experience education, Education Code 51760.3 and 5 CCR 1635 require the district to grant credit within prescribed limits for students who meet eligibility criteria and are provided specified instruction or counseling; see AR 6178.1 - Work Based Learning. However, the district may determine whether these courses satisfy course requirements for graduation.
	Supervised work experience or other outside school experience in accordance with Education Code 51760.3 and 5 CCR 1635  (Education Code 51225.3)
	 
	Career technical education classes offered in high school (Education Code 51225.3)
	 
	Courses offered by regional occupational centers or programs (Education Code 51225.3)
	 
	Interdisciplinary study (Education Code 51225.3)
	 
	Independent study  (Education Code 51225.3)
	
	CSBA NOTE: According to the CDE, students concurrently enrolled in college classes will receive credit from the postsecondary institution, but the district has discretion to determine whether completion of college classes will be awarded credit from the district; see AR 6172.1 - Concurrent Enrollment in College Classes.
	Credit earned at a postsecondary institution  (Education Code 48800, 51225.3)
	 
	Private instruction in accordance with 5 CCR 1631
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51740-51741 require that, in order to offer credit for correspondence instruction as provided in item #9 below, the district must receive authorization from the Superintendent of PublicInstruction (SPI). Correspondence instruction could include a course offered online or through distance learning or other means provided that the coursework meets the criteria specified in 5 CCR 1633 and is approved by the SPI; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
	Correspondence instruction from a California university or college accredited for teacher training in accordance with 5 CCR 1633 (Education Code 51740-51741)
	 
	Military service and training in accordance with 5 CCR 1634 (Education Code 51440)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #11 below is for use by districts that require driver education as part of the prescribed course of study, but allow students to alternatively meet this requirement through a program approved by the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to Vehicle Code 12814.6.
	To satisfy the district's driver education and training requirement, a program approved by the Department of Motor Vehicles which offers driver education and behind-the-wheel instruction through a driving school or licensed independent driving instructor in accordance with Vehicle Code 12814.6
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #12 below is for use by districts wishing to give physical education credit for the participation of students in a regular school-sponsored interscholastic athletic program carried on wholly or partially after regular school hours. Education Code 51242 authorizes districts to grant exemptions from physical education to high school students participating in such programs; see BP 6142.7 - Physical Education. This item may be expanded to specify a limit on the number of credits that may be obtained in this manner.
	For credit toward the district's physical education requirement, participation in district interscholastic athletic programs carried on wholly or partially after regular school hours (Education Code 51242)
	
	A student shall be eligible to satisfy graduation requirements in this manner only if the interscholastic program entails a comparable amount of time and physical activity.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #13 below is required. Pursuant to Education Code 51243 and 5 CCR 1632, districts are required to grant credit for foreign language studies completed in a private school; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
	For credit toward the district's foreign language requirement, foreign language studies successfully completed in a private school in accordance with 5 CCR 1632  (Education Code 51243)
	 

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraphs should be revised to reflect district practice.
Upon receiving advance, written application by the student or his/her parent/guardian, the Superintendent or designee shall determine whether completion of the proposed alternative means would satisfy course requirements for graduation and what documentation shall be required, if any, to verify the student's successful completion. The Superintendent or designee shall make the final determination as to whether the student's completion of an alternative means is sufficient to satisfy the district's graduation requirements.

As appropriate, the Superintendent or designee shall determine the grade to be assigned to students for the completion of any of the above alternative means.  When a grade is assigned by a private school, postsecondary institution, or other educational institution for completion of coursework, that same grade shall be awarded by the district provided that the Superintendent or designee has determined the alternative course to be substantially equivalent to a district course.
