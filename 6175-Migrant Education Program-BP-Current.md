## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that have established migrant education programs pursuant to federal Title I, Part C (20 USC 6391-6399) and Education Code 54440-54445. In California, most districts that provide migrant education services operate pursuant to service agreements with regional service centers pursuant to Education Code 54444.1. The district submits a service application to the regional center, which then submits a regional application to the California Department of Education (CDE). The following policy and accompanying administrative regulation should be revised as necessary to reflect the district's agreement with its regional service center.During the Federal Program Monitoring (FPM) process, CDE will review whether the district is fulfilling the major legal requirements for implementation of the program. Education Code 51225.2 describes this group of highly mobile students as "a pupil who is a migratory child" and CDE's Uniform Complaint Procedures 2023-24 FPM instrument describes this group as "pupils who are migratory", which is reflected in the use of this description throughout the policy. The following policy may be revised to reflect terminology preferred by the district and local community.Pursuant to Education Code 41601.6, up to two local educational agencies may request authorization from CDE to provide an extended school year program to specified students who are migratory, which includes average daily attendance funding for such students; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Governing Board desires to provide a comprehensive program for students who are migratory that attempts to mitigate the impact of educational disruption, cultural and language barriers, social isolation, health-related problems, and other factors that may inhibit their ability to succeed in school. The district shall make use of available funds to provide supplementary services for students who are migratory.

The Superintendent or designee shall cooperate with the regional migrant service center in outreach and identification of eligible students who are migratory and in the provision of migrant education services. The Superintendent or designee shall also coordinate migrant education services with other programs within the district and with other public agencies that serve migrant workers and their families.

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6394 establishes priority for services for students who are migratory who are failing or at risk of failing to meet state standards or have dropped out of school. According to CDE's 2017, "State Service Delivery Plan," for purposes of establishing priority for services, students are considered to be failing or at risk of failing to achieve state standards if they (1) score at Level 1-2 (standard not met or standard nearly met) on the English language or mathematics summative assessments of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, or (2) score at Levels 1-3 (beginning to moderately developed English skills) on the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California.
The district shall give first priority for services to students who are migratory who are failing, or are most at risk of failing, to meet state academic standards or have dropped out of school.  (20 USC 6394)

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 7881 requires that eligible private school students residing within the district be provided an opportunity to receive services on an equitable basis with public school students, as provided below. See AR 6171 - Title I Programs for further information about requirements pertaining to such participation.
The district shall provide services to eligible private school students residing within the district on an equitable basis with participating public school students.  (20 USC 7881; 34 CFR 200.87)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 54443.1 requires that local migrant education programs conduct an individual assessment of the educational and health needs of each student who is migratory and prepare a brief individual learning plan listing the services to be provided to each student; see the accompanying administrative regulation. These duties may be performed by either the district or the regional service center depending on their agreement.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each student who is migratory is placed at the appropriate grade level upon enrollment and is provided services in accordance with an individual needs assessment and learning plan.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice, including specific indicators that the Governing Board and Superintendent or designee agree to use in evaluating program effectiveness.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board regarding student performance on statewide assessments of core academic subjects and English language development, as appropriate, for students enrolled in the district's migrant education program. In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Board regarding the alignment of district services with the needs of students as identified in student needs assessments conducted pursuant to Education Code 54443.1. As necessary, the Board shall seek technical assistance from the migrant education regional service center and/or make changes in the services provided by the district in order to improve student achievement.
