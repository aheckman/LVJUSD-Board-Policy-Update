As the legal representative of the District in negotiations with employee representatives, the Board shall set goals and guidelines for collective bargaining, select the bargaining team, maintain communications during the bargaining process, and adopt the negotiated contract. Terms and conditions of employment which have been negotiated and stated in employee contracts shall have the force of policy. The Board shall hear employee complaints and appeals when such hearings are in accordance with Board policy or negotiated agreements.

Individuals who approach Board members regarding prospective employment shall be referred to the Superintendent or designee.

The Superintendent or designee shall assign and supervise the work of all employees and shall evaluate their work in accordance with effective accountability systems approved by the Board. The Superintendent or designee also shall recommend disciplinary action which the Board may take against employees when warranted pursuant to Board policy, administrative regulations and/or state or federal law.

The Board recognizes that every employee has a stake in the District's successful operation. The Board encourages all District employees to express their ideas, concerns and proposals related to the improvement of working conditions and the total educational program.
