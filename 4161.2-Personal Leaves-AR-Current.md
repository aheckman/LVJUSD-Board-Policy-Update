## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following mandated administrative regulation is subject to collective bargaining and should be revised in accordance with any applicable collective bargaining agreement. To the extent that this administrative regulation is inconsistent with provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement would prevail, so long as the provision is consistent with law.
Personal leaves granted to district employees shall be used as permitted in law, this administrative regulation, other Governing Board-approved policy or district regulation, or applicable collective bargaining agreement, or as otherwise required by law.

CSBA NOTE: Family Code 297.5 extends to registered domestic partners the same rights that are available under state law to spouses. Thus, any reference to an employee's spouse throughout this administrative regulation also applies to a registered domestic partner, even if not expressly stated in the applicable state statute (e.g., Education Code, Military and Veterans Code). Districts should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel if a question arises as to leave provisions relative to an employee's domestic partner.
For the purpose of any personal leave offered pursuant to state law, a registered domestic partner shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits as a spouse and any protections provided to a spouse's child shall also apply to a child of a registered domestic partner.  (Family Code 297.5)

Whenever possible, employees shall request personal leaves in advance and prepare suitable instructions, including lesson plans as applicable, for a substitute employee.

Bereavement

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 12945.7, districts are required to provide up to five days of bereavement leave for the death of an employee's "family member," as defined, if the employee was employed by the district for at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the bereavement leave. Education Code 44985 and 45194 grant three days, or five days if out-of-state travel is required, of paid bereavement leave for certificated and classified employees upon the death of a member of the employee's "immediate family." Government Code 12945.7 potentially expands the length of this leave, but not necessarily the requirement to pay for this leave. Education Code 44985 and 45194 grant bereavement leave for a member of the employee's "immediate family," the definition of which is more expansive than a "family member," pursuant to Government Code 12945.7. Any bereavement leave taken under the Education Code and/or Government Code runs concurrently and not consecutively.The bereavement leave days do not need to be taken consecutively, but must be taken within three months of the family member's date of death. Districts with existing policies that provide employees less than five days of paid bereavement leave must continue to give employees the number of paid days specified in the policy, but may provide the remainder of the five days as unpaid bereavement leave. Districts must allow employees to use any paid vacation, personal leave, sick leave, or compensatory time off for the balance of the unpaid bereavement leave. Additionally, Government Code 12945.7 makes it unlawful to retaliate or discriminate against an employee for using bereavement leave or to interfere with an employee's right to use bereavement leave.Education Code 44985 and 45194 allow the Governing Board to expand the class of relatives listed below as "immediate family" and enlarge the benefits provided by law. Additionally, Government Code 12945.2 includes parent-in-law in the definition of "family member" for purposes of bereavement leave. Thus, to ensure consistency, the definition of "immediate family" includes "parent-in-law" as permitted by law.Districts with questions about bereavement leave should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.The following paragraphs may be revised to reflect district practice.
Employees are entitled to a leave of up to five days upon the death of any member of the employee's immediate family, as defined in Education Code 44985 and 45194.

"Immediate family" means a parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, or grandchild of the employee or of the spouse of the employee, and the spouse, domestic partner, child, child-in-law, sibling, or sibling-in-law of the employee, or any relative living in the immediate household of the employee.  (Education Code 44985, 45194; Government Code 12945.7)

No deduction shall be made from the employee's salary for any authorized paid bereavement leave as specified in the collective bargaining agreement or as otherwise established by this policy, nor shall such leave be deducted from any other leave to which the employee is entitled unless requested by the employee.  (Education Code 44985, 45194; Government Code 12945.7)

At the employee's request, bereavement leave may be extended under personal necessity leave provisions as provided in the section "Personal Necessity" below.  (Education Code 44981, 45207)

Reproductive Loss

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 12945.6, as added by SB 848 (Ch. 724, Statutes of 2023), the district is prohibited from refusing to grant a request by an employee who has worked at least 30 days for the district to take up to five days of reproductive loss leave following a reproductive loss event. The district is not required to grant more than 20 days for multiple reproductive loss events during a 12-month period.Government Code 12945.6, as added by SB 848, prohibits the district from retaliating or discriminating against an employee for taking reproductive loss leave or giving information or testimony related to such right, or to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise or attempted exercise of this right.
Upon request by any employee who has experienced a reproductive loss event, defined as the day or, for a multiple-day event, the final day of a failed adoption, failed surrogacy, miscarriage, stillbirth, or an unsuccessful assisted reproduction, the district shall grant the employee up to five days of reproductive loss leave, to be taken consecutively or non-consecutively. The employee shall take the leave within three months following the event. If the employee is on another type of leave at the time of the reproductive loss event, or chooses to take another type of leave immediately following a reproductive loss event, then the reproductive loss leave shall be completed within three months of the end date of the other leave.  (Government Code 12945.6)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 12945.6, as added by SB 848, reproductive loss leave is required to be taken pursuant to any existing applicable leave policy of the district. However, if the district's leave policy does not so specify, the reproductive loss leave will be unpaid, but the employee may use vacation, personal leave, accrued and available sick leave, or compensatory time off that is otherwise available to the employee. Districts that provide paid reproductive loss leave should revise the following paragraph to reflect district practice.
Reproductive loss leave will be unpaid unless the employee chooses to use vacation, personal leave, accrued and available sick leave, or compensatory time off that is otherwise available to the employee.  (Government Code 12945.6)

Any request or inquiry or information provided by an employee related to reproductive loss leave and/or a reproductive loss shall remain confidential, except to internal personnel or counsel as necessary or as required by law.

Personal Necessity

CSBA NOTE: Employees may use a maximum of seven days of accumulated personal illness/injury leave (sick leave) for reasons of personal necessity pursuant to Education Code 44981 (certificated employees) and 45207 (classified employees). Pursuant to Education Code 44981 and 45207, a higher maximum may be set for certificated and/or classified employees in the applicable collective bargaining agreement, or by Board resolution for classified employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Districts that have established a maximum that is higher than seven days should modify the following paragraph accordingly.Education Code 45207 clarifies that provisions pertaining to personal necessity leave also apply to districts that have adopted the merit system for classified employees in accordance with Education Code 45240-45320.
Employees may use a maximum of seven days of accrued personal illness/injury leave (sick leave) during each school year for reasons of personal necessity.  (Education Code 44981, 45207)

Acceptable reasons for the use of personal necessity leave include:

	Death of a member of the employee's immediate family when the number of days of absence exceeds the limits set by bereavement leave provisions  (Education Code 44981, 45207; Government Code 12945.7)
	 
	An accident involving the employee or the employee's property, or the person or property of a member of the employee's immediate family  (Education Code 44981, 45207)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44981, a certificated employee may use personal necessity leave for the serious illness of a member of the employee's immediate family. The Board may extend these provisions to classified employees under the authority granted to the Board by Education Code 45207. Districts are cautioned to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel regarding any interaction of Education Code provisions with Labor Code 233, 245.5, and 246.5, which allow the use of sick leave for the need of the employee or family member for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition or for preventive care and which include in the definition of "family member" a registered domestic partner, grandparent, and sibling. See AR 4161.1/4361.1 - Personal Illness/Injury Leave and AR 4261.1 - Personal Illness/Injury Leave.Pursuant to Government Code 12945.2 and Labor Code 245.5, the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) provides an eligible employee with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to care for a designated person who has a serious health condition, in addition to caring for a child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or domestic partner. A "designated person" is defined as any individual related by blood or whose association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. The employee may identify the designated person at the time the employee requests the leave. The district may limit the employee to taking CFRA leave to care for one designated person per 12-month period. For further information regarding medical leave, see AR 4161.8/4261.8/4361.8 - Family Care and Medical Leave.
	Illness, preventive care, or other need of a member of the employee's family, as defined in Labor Code 245.5  (Education Code 44981; Government Code 12945.2; Labor Code 246.5)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 45207 provides that classified employees may use sick leave for required court appearances, as provided in Item #4 below. Circumstances under which employees may take time off, with pay, for court appearances are described in the section on "Leave to Perform Legal Duties" below.
	A classified employee's appearance in any court or before any administrative tribunal as a litigant, party, or witness under subpoena or other order  (Education Code 45207)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Items #5 and #6 are optional and may be deleted or modified to reflect district practice.
	Fire, flood, or other immediate danger to the home of the employee
	 
	Personal business of a serious nature which the employee cannot disregard

Leave for personal necessity may be allowed for other reasons at the discretion of the Superintendent or designee. However, personal necessity leave shall not be granted for purposes of personal convenience, for the extension of a holiday or vacation, or for matters which can be taken care of outside of working hours. The Superintendent or designee shall have final discretion as to whether a request reflects personal necessity.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. The district is prohibited from requiring employees to obtain advance permission prior to taking leaves in certain situations. Pursuant to Education Code 44981 and 45207, the district may not require advance permission for leaves taken by classified employees for the reasons specified in Items #1-2 above and by certificated employees for the reasons specified in Items #1-3 above. In addition, Labor Code 246.5 requires an employer to grant paid sick leave "upon the oral or written request of an employee." According to the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR), employers may not require advance notice when the need for the leave was unforeseeable, as in the case of unanticipated illness or a medical emergency.Also see AR 4161.8/4261.8/4361.8 - Family Care and Medical Leave for requirements pertaining to requests for leaves that qualify under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (29 USC 2601-2654) or CFRA (Government Code 12945.1-12945.2), including provisions that allow employees to provide notice as soon as practicable when 30-day advance notice is not practicable due to lack of knowledge of the date the leave will be needed, a change in circumstances, or a medical emergency.
Advance permission shall not be required of an employee in any case involving the death of a member of the employee's immediate family, an accident involving the employee's person or property or the person or property of a member of the employee's immediate family, or the illness, preventive care, or other need of a member of the employee's family.  (Education Code 44981, 45207)

For any leave that is planned, or for which the need is foreseeable, an employee shall notify the Superintendent or designee in advance. In all other circumstances, the employee shall notify the Superintendent or designee of the need for the leave as soon as practicable.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44981 and 45207 mandate the adoption of regulations requiring proof of personal necessity and prescribing the manner of the required proof. The following paragraph may be revised to specify the manner of proof required by the district.
After any absence due to personal necessity, the employee shall verify the absence by submitting a completed and signed district absence form to the employee's immediate supervisor.

Leave to Perform Legal Duties

CSBA NOTE: Labor Code 230 prohibits the discharge of or discrimination or retaliation against an employee for taking time off for the activities specified in Items #1-2 below.Pursuant to Education Code 44037, it is unlawful for the district, or personnel commission for merit districts, to (1) adopt any rule, regulation, or policy that encourages classified employees to seek exemption from jury duty; (2) directly or indirectly solicit or suggest to any employee that the employee seek exemption from jury duty; or (3) discriminate against any employee with respect to assignment, employment, promotion, or in any other manner because of the employee's service on a jury panel. However, the Board or personnel commission may establish a rule providing that only a percentage of district staff, which shall not be less than two percent, shall be granted such leave with pay at any one time. The following section may be revised to reflect district practice.
An employee may take time off work in order to:  (Labor Code 230)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional and applies only to certificated employees. Education Code 44036 allows the Board, at its discretion, to provide paid leaves for employees to appear in court as witnesses other than as litigants or to respond to orders from another governmental jurisdiction.The Board may grant the leave with or without pay. Districts that do not grant such leave should delete this paragraph, or revise it to reflect district practice.
A certificated employee shall be granted leave with pay to appear in court as a witness other than as a litigant or to respond to an official order from another governmental jurisdiction for reasons not brought about through the connivance or misconduct of the employee. Such an employee shall receive the difference between the employee's regular earnings and any witness fees received.  (Education Code 44036)

A district with 15 or fewer employees may use or delete this section at its discretion.
An employee may take up to 10 days of unpaid leave per calendar year, beyond any leave otherwise available to the employee, to respond to an emergency operational mission of the California Civil Air Patrol, provided that the employee has been employed by the district for at least a 90-day period immediately preceding the leave. Such leaves shall not exceed three days for a single mission, unless an extension is granted by the governmental entity authorizing the mission and is approved by the Superintendent or designee.  (Labor Code 1501, 1503)

The employee shall give the district as much advance notice as possible of the intended dates of the leave. The Superintendent or designee may require certification from the proper Civil Air Patrol authority to verify the eligibility of the employee for the leave and may deny the leave if the employee fails to provide the required certification.  (Labor Code 1503)

<strong>Bereavement</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='yNA789' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 12945.7, districts are required to provide up to five days of bereavement leave for the death of an employee's "family member," as defined, if the employee was employed by the district for at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the bereavement leave. Education Code 44985 and 45194 grant three days, or five days if out-of-state travel is required, of paid bereavement leave for certificated and classified employees upon the death of a member of the employee's "immediate family." Government Code 12945.7 potentially expands the length of this leave, but not necessarily the requirement to pay for this leave. Education Code 44985 and 45194 grant bereavement leave for a member of the employee's "immediate family," the definition of which is more expansive than a "family member," pursuant to Government Code 12945.7. Any bereavement leave taken under the Education Code and/or Government Code runs concurrently and not consecutively.<br><br>The bereavement leave days do not need to be taken consecutively, but must be taken within three months of the family member's date of death. Districts with existing policies that provide employees less than five days of paid bereavement leave must continue to give employees the number of paid days specified in the policy, but may provide the remainder of the five days as unpaid bereavement leave. Districts must allow employees to use any paid vacation, personal leave, sick leave, or compensatory time off for the balance of the unpaid bereavement leave. Additionally, Government Code 12945.7 makes it unlawful to retaliate or discriminate against an employee for using bereavement leave or to interfere with an employee's right to use bereavement leave.<br><br>Education Code 44985 and 45194 allow the Governing Board to expand the class of relatives listed below as "immediate family" and enlarge the benefits provided by law. Additionally, Government Code 12945.2 includes parent-in-law in the definition of "family member" for purposes of bereavement leave. Thus, to ensure consistency, the definition of "immediate family" includes "parent-in-law" as permitted by law.<br><br>Districts with questions about bereavement leave should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.<br><br>The following paragraphs may be revised to reflect district practice.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MzYwOQ19" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MzYwOQ19%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22yNA789%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1717520496%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2012945.7%2C%20districts%20are%20required%20to%20provide%20up%20to%20five%20days%20of%20bereavement%20leave%20for%20the%20death%20of%20an%20employee%27s%20%5C%22family%20member%2C%5C%22%20as%20defined%2C%20if%20the%20employee%20was%20employed%20by%20the%20district%20for%20at%20least%2030%20days%20prior%20to%20the%20commencement%20of%20the%20bereavement%20leave.%20Education%20Code%2044985%20and%2045194%20grant%20three%20days%2C%20or%20five%20days%20if%20out-of-state%20travel%20is%20required%2C%20of%20paid%20bereavement%20leave%20for%20certificated%20and%20classified%20employees%20upon%20the%20death%20of%20a%20member%20of%20the%20employee%27s%20%5C%22immediate%20family.%5C%22%20Government%20Code%2012945.7%20potentially%20expands%20the%20length%20of%20this%20leave%2C%20but%20not%20necessarily%20the%20requirement%20to%20pay%20for%20this%20leave.%20Education%20Code%2044985%20and%2045194%20grant%20bereavement%20leave%20for%20a%20member%20of%20the%20employee%27s%20%5C%22immediate%20family%2C%5C%22%20the%20definition%20of%20which%20is%20more%20expansive%20than%20a%20%5C%22family%20member%2C%5C%22%20pursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2012945.7.%20Any%20bereavement%20leave%20taken%20under%20the%20Education%20Code%20and/or%20Government%20Code%20runs%20concurrently%20and%20not%20consecutively.%5Cn%5CnThe%20bereavement%20leave%20days%20do%20not%20need%20to%20be%20taken%20consecutively%2C%20but%20must%20be%20taken%20within%20three%20months%20of%20the%20family%20member%27s%20date%20of%20death.%20Districts%20with%20existing%20policies%20that%20provide%20employees%20less%20than%20five%20days%20of%20paid%20bereavement%20leave%20must%20continue%20to%20give%20employees%20the%20number%20of%20paid%20days%20specified%20in%20the%20policy%2C%20but%20may%20provide%20the%20remainder%20of%20the%20five%20days%20as%20unpaid%20bereavement%20leave.%20Districts%20must%20allow%20employees%20to%20use%20any%20paid%20vacation%2C%20personal%20leave%2C%20sick%20leave%2C%20or%20compensatory%20time%20off%20for%20the%20balance%20of%20the%20unpaid%20bereavement%20leave.%20Additionally%2C%20Government%20Code%2012945.7%20makes%20it%20unlawful%20to%20retaliate%20or%20discriminate%20against%20an%20employee%20for%20using%20bereavement%20leave%20or%20to%20interfere%20with%20an%20employee%27s%20right%20to%20use%20bereavement%20leave.%5Cn%5CnEducation%20Code%2044985%20and%2045194%20allow%20the%20Governing%20Board%20to%20expand%20the%20class%20of%20relatives%20listed%20below%20as%20%5C%22immediate%20family%5C%22%20and%20enlarge%20the%20benefits%20provided%20by%20law.%20Additionally%2C%20Government%20Code%2012945.2%20includes%20parent-in-law%20in%20the%20definition%20of%20%5C%22family%20member%5C%22%20for%20purposes%20of%20bereavement%20leave.%20Thus%2C%20to%20ensure%20consistency%2C%20the%20definition%20of%20%5C%22immediate%20family%5C%22%20includes%20%5C%22parent-in-law%5C%22%20as%20permitted%20by%20law.%5Cn%5CnDistricts%20with%20questions%20about%20bereavement%20leave%20should%20consult%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel.%5Cn%5CnThe%20following%20paragraphs%20may%20be%20revised%20to%20reflect%20district%20practice.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MzYwOQ19" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 12945.7, di..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

Acceptable reasons for the use of personal necessity leave include:
<ol>
	<li>Death of a member of the employee&#39;s immediate family when the number of days of absence exceeds the limits set by bereavement leave provisions&nbsp; (Education Code 44981, 45207; Government Code 12945.7)<br>

	<div id='cNA793' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44981, a certificated employee may use personal necessity leave for the serious illness of a member of the employee's immediate family. The Board may extend these provisions to classified employees under the authority granted to the Board by Education Code 45207.

A "designated person" is defined as any individual related by blood or whose association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. The employee may identify the designated person at the time the employee requests the leave. The district may limit the employee to taking CFRA leave to care for one designated person per 12-month period.
