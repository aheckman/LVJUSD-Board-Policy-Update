## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE:  Education Code 44808.5 grants the Governing Board the authority to allow high school students to leave the school campus during lunch. Neither the district nor its employees or officers are liable for the conduct or safety of students who leave school grounds pursuant to Education Code 44808.5. Districts that maintain high schools may select Option 1 (open campus) or Option 2 (closed campus) below. Districts that do not maintain high schools may delete this policy or select Option 2.
OPTION 1:  Open Campus

In order to give students an opportunity to demonstrate responsibility, independent judgment, and positive citizenship, the Governing Board establishes an open campus at all district high schools in which students shall have the privilege of leaving campus during lunch.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that choose to impose conditions on the privilege to leave campus during lunch (e.g., based on academic achievement, attendance, and/or grade level) and may be revised to reflect specific district criteria, the process for determining eligibility, and/or the person responsible for enforcement.
The principal or designee shall ensure that students granted this privilege meet any eligibility requirements established by the district.

The district shall send written notification to parents/guardians about the open campus policy at the beginning of the school year along with the parental notification required by Education Code 48980. Such notification shall include the language prescribed by Education Code 44808.5.

Students shall not leave school grounds at any other time during the school day without express permission of school authorities. Students who leave school without authorization shall be considered to have an unexcused absence and be subject to disciplinary action.

The principal or designee may revoke the open campus privilege for individual students for disciplinary reasons.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  Closed Campus

In order to keep students in a supervised, safe, and orderly environment, the Governing Board establishes a closed campus at all district schools.

Students shall not leave school grounds at any time during the school day without express permission of school authorities. Students who leave school without authorization shall be considered to have an unexcused absence and be subject to disciplinary action.

Student handbooks shall fully explain all rules and disciplinary procedures involved in the maintenance of the closed campus.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE
