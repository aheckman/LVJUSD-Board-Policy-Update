An employee shall not unlawfully manufacture, distribute, dispense, possess, or use any controlled substance in the workplace.  (Government Code 8355; 41 USC 8103)

Employees are prohibited from being under the influence of controlled substances or alcohol while on duty.  For purposes of this policy, on duty means while an employee is on duty during both instructional and noninstructional time in the classroom or workplace, at extracurricular or cocurricular activities, or while transporting students or otherwise supervising them.  Under the influence means that the employee's capabilities are adversely or negatively affected, impaired, or diminished to an extent that impacts the employee's ability to safely and effectively perform his/her job.

The Superintendent or designee shall notify the appropriate federal granting or contracting agency within 10 days after receiving notification, from an employee or otherwise, of any conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace.  (41 USC 8103)

In accordance with law and the District's collective bargaining agreements, the Superintendent or designee shall take appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against an employee for violating the terms of this policy and/or shall require the employee to satisfactorily participate in and complete a drug assistance or rehabilitation program approved by a federal, state, or local public health or law enforcement agency or other appropriate agency.
