## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: If the district chooses to authorize its teachers to require parents/guardians to attend a portion of a school day in their child's classroom when their child has been removed from class pursuant to Education Code 48910 for the reasons specified in Education Code 48900(i) (obscene act or habitual profanity or vulgarity) or 48900(k) (disruption of school activities or willful defiance), Education Code 48900.1 mandates that the district adopt specified procedures as reflected in the following administrative regulation.
Whenever a teacher requires a parent/guardian to attend a portion of a school day with his/her child for the child's commission of an act specified in Education Code 48900(i) or (k), the principal shall send the parent/guardian a written notice that the parent/guardian's attendance is required pursuant to law.  (Education Code 48900.1)

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-4 below should be modified to reflect district practice.
The notice shall:

	Inform the parent/guardian of the date that his/her presence is expected, the length of the visit, and by what means he/she may arrange an alternate date
	 
	State that if the parent/guardian does not have a means of transportation to school, he/she may ride the school bus with the student
	 
	Direct the parent/guardian to meet with the principal after the visit and before leaving school
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48900.1, the district must take into account reasonable factors that may prevent the parent/guardian from complying with the parental attendance requirement, such as illness, injury, disability, risk of losing his/her job or compensation, or absence from town.
	Direct the parent/guardian to contact the school if there are reasonable factors that would prevent him/her from complying with the attendance requirement

Attendance of the parent/guardian shall be limited to the class from which the student was removed. (Education Code 48900.1)

CSBA NOTE: For any district that authorizes parental attendance as a disciplinary option, Education Code 48900.1 mandates that the district's procedures ensure that parents/guardians who attend school meet with the principal or designee after completing the classroom visitation and before leaving the school.

A parent/guardian who has received a written notice shall attend class as specified in the notice. After completing the classroom visit and before leaving school premises, the parent/guardian also shall meet with the principal or designee.  (Education Code 48900.1)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
At the meeting with the student's parent/guardian, the principal or designee shall explain the district's and school's discipline policies, including the disciplinary strategies that may be used to achieve proper student conduct.
