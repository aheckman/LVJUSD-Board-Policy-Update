CSBA NOTE: The oath or affirmation required of Governing Board members pursuant to Article 20, Section 3, of the California Constitution is the same as that required by Government Code 3100-3109 for public employees. See E(1) 4112.3/4212.3/4312.3 - Oath or Affirmation for the text of the oath. Government Code 1303 provides that any person who exercises any function of a public office, including the office of a Board member, without taking the oath of office is guilty of a misdemeanor. Additionally, Government Code 1367 prohibits payment of any compensation or reimbursement for any expenses to any individual who has not taken the oath or affirmation.If an incoming Board member raises a concern about taking the oath or affirmation, it is recommended that the district consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
Prior to entering upon the duties of the office of a Governing Board member or exercising any function of a Board member, each Board member shall take the oath or affirmation required by law.  (California Constitution, Article 20, Section 3; Government Code 1360)

CSBA NOTE: In addition to the persons listed below, Education Code 60 specifies state- and local-level officers who may administer the oath.
The oath or affirmation may be administered and certified by a Board member, the secretary or assistant secretary to the Board, the Superintendent, the County Superintendent of Schools, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, or any other person authorized in Education Code 60 or Government Code 1225.

The executed oath shall be filed with the County Clerk.  (Government Code 1363)
