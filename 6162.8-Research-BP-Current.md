## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51513 and 20 USC 1232h specify that districts may not require a student to submit to a survey requesting personal student information without prior written consent by the student's parent/guardian. This prohibition applies to surveys and research conducted by third parties. See BP/AR 5022 - Student and Family Privacy Rights for a definition of "personal information," required notifications to parents/guardians, and procedures to protect student privacy. The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. 
The Governing Board recognizes the value of academic research to improve educational programs and practices.  Researchers shall respect the privacy rights of students, including their right to refrain from participation in research projects in accordance with law, Board policy and administrative regulation.

The Superintendent or designee may authorize research projects within the district by outside groups or persons when such research is aligned with district goals and objectives and is likely to benefit the district without disrupting the school program.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that parents/guardians receive prior notification of any surveys or evaluations that collect personal student information and that consent is obtained in accordance with law.
