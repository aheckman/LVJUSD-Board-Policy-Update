## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy addresses employment contracts for individuals occupying certificated and classified administrative, supervisory, and management positions. For policy language regarding superintendent contracts, see BP 2121 - Superintendent's Contract.
The Governing Board recognizes the importance of employing qualified and competent individuals to manage district programs and to assist the Superintendent in coordinating efforts to achieve district goals and objectives. To that end, the Board may fill certificated administrative and supervisory positions and classified senior management positions on a contract basis.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35031 authorizes continuing contracts, as specified below, for any deputy, associate, or assistant superintendent in a position requiring certification qualifications.  Pursuant to Education Code 35030, the title of deputy, associate, or assistant superintendent may be assigned to a business management position.
The Board may offer a continuing contract of up to four years to any deputy, associate, or assistant superintendent; any certificated employee holding a position requiring a supervision or administration credential; or any senior manager of the classified service.  (Education Code 35031, 44929.20)

Prior to entering into any such contract, the Board and Superintendent shall consider the financial impact of the contract on the district.  The proposed contract shall also be reviewed by legal counsel to ensure that all legally required provisions are included in the contract and to address any potentially adverse obligations for the district.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54957, personnel matters related to the appointment or employment of any employee may appropriately be discussed in closed session under the "personnel exception." However, Government Code 54957 prohibits the use of closed session for discussion or action on any proposed change in compensation other than a reduction that results from the imposition of discipline. In San Diego Union v. City Council, a California Court of Appeal held that the "personnel exception" provided in Government Code 54957 does not extend to discussions of salary and compensation. Notwithstanding Government Code 54957, the Governing Board is authorized pursuant to Government Code 54957.6, the "labor exception," to hold closed sessions with the district's designated representatives regarding the salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits to its represented and unrepresented employees.  The Attorney General has opined in 57 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 209 (1974) that a board may only meet in closed session under the labor exception with a designated representative who is involved with the "bona fide" negotiations with represented and/or unrepresented employees. The Attorney General's publication The Brown Act: Open Meetings for Local Legislative Bodies also states that the "labor exception" applies to meeting in closed session to instruct its representatives concerning negotiations with prospective employees.  Boards wishing to discuss salary of administrative personnel in closed session under the "labor exception" are encouraged to consult legal counsel before doing so. In addition, pursuant to Government Code 54956, the Board is prohibited from deliberating on the salary or other compensation of an employee at a special meeting.  See BB 9320 - Meetings and Notices and BB 9321 - Closed Session Purposes and Agendas. The following paragraph should be revised to reflect district practice.
The Board may deliberate in the closed session of a regular meeting about the terms of an employment contract for a deputy, associate, or assistant superintendent; other certificated employee holding a position requiring a supervision or administration credential; or a senior manager of the classified service. Discussions regarding salary, salary schedule, or other compensation may occur in the closed session of a regular meeting only between the Board and its designated representative(s), as permitted under Government Code 54957.6 (the "labor exception") for the purpose of reviewing the Board's position and/or instructing the designated representative(s) prior to or during bona fide negotiations with the employee. Such deliberations shall not be held during a special meeting.  (Government Code 54956, 54957, 54957.6)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54953, as amended by SB 1436 (Ch. 175, Statutes of 2016), the Board must orally report, in an open session, a summary of the recommendation for final action on the salary and/or benefits of a "local agency executive," as defined in Government Code 3511.1, including a deputy, associate, or assistant superintendent; a department head; and any other person whose position within the district is established through an employment contract with the district. Thus, Government Code 54953 limits the Board's ability to approve changes to salary or benefits as part of a consent calendar and instead requires such approval to be a separate agenda item. For identical requirements regarding final action on the salary or benefits of the Superintendent, see BP 2121 - Superintendent's Contract.
The Board shall take final action on an employment contract during an open session of a regularly scheduled Board meeting, and that action shall be reflected in the Board's minutes. At that meeting, prior to taking action, the Board shall orally report a summary of the recommendation for the final action on salary or compensation in the form of fringe benefits.  (Government Code 3511.1, 53262, 54953)

Copies of any contract and other public records created or received in the process of developing the recommendation related to the salary, benefits, and other compensation shall be available to the public upon request.  (Government Code 53262, 54953)

Extension of Contract/Reemployment

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph provides that any contract extension be based on Board action rather than automatic "rollover" or "evergreen" provisions. Government Code 3511.2 prohibits the automatic renewal of a contract with a provision for automatic increase that exceeds the cost-of-living adjustment.
A contract shall be extended only by Board action and subsequent to a satisfactory evaluation of the employee's performance. No employment contract shall include a provision for automatic renewal of the contract.

During the term of the contract and with the consent of the employee involved, the Board may reelect or reemploy the employee starting on the next succeeding first day of July and based on terms and conditions mutually agreed upon by the Board and the employee.  (Education Code 35031)

If the Board decides not to reelect or reemploy a deputy, associate, or assistant superintendent or a senior manager of the classified service upon the expiration of his/her term, it shall notify the employee in writing 45 calendar days prior to the expiration of the term of the contract.  (Education Code 35031)

Termination of Contract

The Board may terminate an employment contract prior to its expiration date in accordance with the conditions and process specified in the contract.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 53260-53264, employment contracts must include a provision limiting the maximum cash settlement the employee may receive upon termination of the contract to an amount equal to his/her monthly salary multiplied by the number of months left on the unexpired term of the contract.  If the unexpired term is greater than 18 months, this maximum is equal to the monthly salary times 18. Cash settlements may be less than these caps. The cash settlement may not include any noncash items other than health benefits, which may be continued for the unexpired term up to 18 months or until the employee finds other employment, whichever occurs first. The district must make copies of termination agreements available to the public upon request. For language reflecting these requirements, see AR 4117.5/4217.5/4317.5 - Termination Agreements.
Every employment contract shall include a provision specifying the legal maximum cash settlement that the employee may receive in the event that the contract is terminated prior to its expiration date.  (Government Code 3511.2, 53260)

In addition, all employment contracts shall include a provision that, if the employee is convicted of a crime involving an abuse of his/her office or position, he/she shall fully reimburse the district for payments he/she receives as paid leave salary pending investigation or as cash settlement upon his/her termination and for any funds expended by the district in his/her criminal legal defense.  (Government Code 53243-53243.4, 53260)

<div id='cMg113' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 53260-53264, employment contracts must include a provision limiting the maximum cash settlement the employee may receive upon termination of the contract to an amount equal to his/her monthly salary multiplied by the number of months left on the unexpired term of the contract.  If the unexpired term is greater than 18 months, this maximum is equal to the monthly salary times 18. Cash settlements may be less than these caps. The cash settlement may not include any noncash items other than health benefits, which may be continued for the unexpired term up to 18 months or until the employee finds other employment, whichever occurs first. The district must make copies of termination agreements available to the public upon request. For language reflecting these requirements, see AR 4117.5/4217.5/4317.5 - Termination Agreements.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="YOTQOA5" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22YOTQOA5%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22cMg113%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1573671838%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2053260-53264%2C%20employment%20contracts%20must%20include%20a%20provision%20limiting%20the%20maximum%20cash%20settlement%20the%20employee%20may%20receive%20upon%20termination%20of%20the%20contract%20to%20an%20amount%20equal%20to%20his/her%20monthly%20salary%20multiplied%20by%20the%20number%20of%20months%20left%20on%20the%20unexpired%20term%20of%20the%20contract.%20%20If%20the%20unexpired%20term%20is%20greater%20than%2018%20months%2C%20this%20maximum%20is%20equal%20to%20the%20monthly%20salary%20times%2018.%20Cash%20settlements%20may%20be%20less%20than%20these%20caps.%20The%20cash%20settlement%20may%20not%20include%20any%20noncash%20items%20other%20than%20health%20benefits%2C%20which%20may%20be%20continued%20for%20the%20unexpired%20term%20up%20to%2018%20months%20or%20until%20the%20employee%20finds%20other%20employment%2C%20whichever%20occurs%20first.%20The%20district%20must%20make%20copies%20of%20termination%20agreements%20available%20to%20the%20public%20upon%20request.%20For%20language%20reflecting%20these%20requirements%2C%20see%20AR%204117.5/4217.5/4317.5%20-%20Termination%20Agreements.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-YOTQOA5" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 53260-53264..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
