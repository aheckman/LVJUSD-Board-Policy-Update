## Policy Content

District equipment shall be used primarily for educational purposes and/or to conduct district business. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all employees, students, and other users understand the appropriate use of district equipment and that any misuse may be cause for disciplinary action or loss of user privilege.

School-connected organizations may be granted reasonable use of the equipment for district-related matters, if such use does not interfere with the use by students or employees or otherwise disrupt district operations.


The Superintendent or designee shall approve the transfer of any district equipment from one work site to another and the removal of any district equipment for off-site use. When any equipment is taken off site, the borrower is responsible for its safe return and shall be fully liable for any loss or damage. Equipment shall only be used for an approved district-related purpose.

Employees transferred to another work site shall take with them only those personal items that have been purchased with their own funds, unless otherwise authorized by the Superintendent or designee or applicable Board policy or administrative regulation.


The Superintendent or designee shall maintain an inventory of all equipment currently valued in excess of $500.  (Education Code 35168; 5 CCR 3946)

Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain property records as specified in Administrative Regulation 3440 - Inventories, including updating property records when there is a change in the status of the property.

When equipment is unusable or is no longer needed, it may be sold, donated, or disposed of in accordance with Education Code 17540-17555 or 2 CFR 200.313, as applicable.

Equipment Acquired with Federal Funds


The Superintendent or designee shall obtain prior written approval from the California Department of Education (CDE) or other awarding agency before purchasing equipment with federal funds.  (2 CFR 200.439)

Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall obtain prior approval from CDE or other awarding agency before disposing or encumbering equipment purchased with federal funds.  (2 CFR 200.313)


Persons involved in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by federal funds shall comply with the requirements specified in 2 CFR 200.313 and 200.318, including conflict of interest requirements, act in accordance with Administrative Regulation 3230 - Federal Grant Funds, and comply with Board Bylaw 9270 - Conflict of Interest.

All equipment purchased for federal programs funded through the consolidated application pursuant to Education Code 64000-64001 shall be labeled with the name of the project, identification number, and name of the district. (2 CFR 200.313; 5 CCR 3946)

For any equipment acquired in whole or in part with federal funds, the Superintendent or designee shall develop adequate maintenance procedures to keep the property in good condition. Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall develop adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property and shall investigate any loss, damage, or theft.  (2 CFR 200.313)

Equipment purchased for use in a federal program shall be used in that program as long as needed, regardless of whether the program continues to be supported by federal funds. The equipment may be used in other activities currently or previously supported by a federal agency when such use does not interfere with the work on the project or program for which it was originally acquired or when use of the equipment is no longer needed for the original program.  (2 CFR 200.313)
