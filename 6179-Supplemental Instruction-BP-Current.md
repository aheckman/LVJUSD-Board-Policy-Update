## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is mandated pursuant to Education Code 48070.5 and should be revised to reflect the grade levels offered by the district. Pursuant to Education Code 52060-52077, the Governing Board must annually adopt a local control and accountability plan which includes goals and actions aligned with state priorities, including student achievement; see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan. The provision of high-quality supplemental instruction may be one strategy to improve student achievement outcomes for underperforming students. In addition, the provision of supplemental instruction may be a strategy to assist low-performing schools identified by the California Department of Education for comprehensive or targeted support and improvement pursuant to 20 USC 6311. Such schools are required to develop and implement a school plan to improve student outcomes.
The Governing Board recognizes that high-quality supplemental instruction can motivate and support students to attain grade-level academic standards, overcome academic deficiencies, and/or acquire critical skills. The district shall offer programs of direct, systematic, and intensive supplemental instruction to meet student needs. Supplemental instruction shall be offered in accordance with law and may be used to assist the district in meeting its goals for student achievement.

Supplemental instruction may be offered during and outside the regular school day, including during the summer, before school, after school, on Saturday, and/or during intersessions.  When supplemental instruction is offered during the regular school day, it shall not supplant the student's instruction in the core curriculum areas or physical education.

As appropriate, supplemental instruction may be provided through a classroom setting, individual or small group instruction, technology-based instruction, and/or an arrangement with a community or other external service provider.

When determined to be necessary by the principal or designee and when written parent/guardian consent is obtained for the student's participation, a student may be required to participate in supplemental instruction outside the regular school day.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48070.5 mandates that districts adopt policy indicating the manner in which opportunities for remedial instruction will be provided to students who are recommended for retention. See BP/AR 5123 - Promotion/Acceleration/Retention for information regarding the criteria for identifying students for retention.
Supplemental instruction shall be offered to students who are recommended for retention, or are identified as being at risk for retention, at their current grade level.  (Education Code 48070.5)

CSBA NOTE:  Items #1-2 below are optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
In addition, supplemental instruction may be offered to:

	 Students who demonstrate academic deficiencies that may jeopardize their attainment of academic standards
	
	CSBA NOTE: The following optional item may be used by districts maintaining high schools.
	 High school students who need support to successfully complete courses required for graduation
