## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation is for use by districts that appoint their own attendance supervisor and may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 48242 and 48243, the district may appoint an attendance supervisor or may jointly employ an attendance supervisor with one or more other districts. Alternatively, pursuant to Education Code 48244, the district may contract with the County Superintendent of Schools for the supervision of attendance of district students.
The Superintendent or designee shall appoint an attendance supervisor and any assistant attendance supervisor(s) as may be necessary to supervise the attendance of district students.  (Education Code 48240, 48242)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48241 and 48245 require an attendance supervisor to be certificated for the work by the County Board of Education.  However, it is not clear that all county boards currently provide this function.  The following paragraph may be revised to reflect local practice.
Any person appointed as an attendance supervisor shall be appropriately certificated to perform the work.  (Education Code 48241, 48245)

Such supervisors shall perform duties related to compulsory full-time education, truancy, compulsory continuation education, work permits, and any additional duties prescribed by the Superintendent or designee.  (Education Code 48240)

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-5 below may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 48240 states the Legislature's intent that attendance supervisors fulfill the following duties.
The attendance supervisor shall promote a culture of attendance and establish a system to accurately track student attendance in order to achieve all of the following:

	Raise the awareness of school personnel, parents/guardians, caregivers, community partners, and local businesses of the effects of chronic absenteeism and truancy and other challenges associated with poor attendance
	 
	Identify and respond to grade level or student subgroup patterns of chronic absenteeism or truancy
	 
	Identify and address factors contributing to chronic absenteeism and habitual truancy, including suspension and expulsion
	 
	Ensure that students with attendance problems are identified as early as possible to provide applicable support services and interventions
	 
	Evaluate the effectiveness of strategies implemented to reduce chronic absenteeism rates and truancy rates

The attendance supervisor may provide support services and interventions, including, but not limited to, the following:  (Education Code 48240)


	A conference between school personnel, the student's parent/guardian, and the student
	 
	Promotion of cocurricular and extracurricular activities that increase student connectedness to school, such as tutoring, mentoring, the arts, service learning, or athletics
	 
	Recognition of students who achieve excellent attendance or demonstrate significant improvement in attendance
	 
	Referral of the student to a school nurse, school counselor, school psychologist, school social worker, and other student support personnel for case management and counseling
	 
	Collaboration with child welfare services, law enforcement, courts, public health care agencies, government agencies, or medical, mental health, and oral health care providers to receive necessary services
	 
	Collaboration with school study teams, guidance teams, school attendance review teams, or other intervention-related teams to assess the attendance or behavior problem in partnership with the student and the student's parents/guardians or caregivers
	 
	In schools with significantly higher rates of chronic absenteeism, identification of barriers to attendance that may require schoolwide strategies rather than case management
	 
	Referral of the student for a comprehensive psychosocial or psychoeducational assessment, including for purposes of creating an individualized education program for a student with disabilities or creating a plan pursuant to Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973
	 
	Referral of the student to a school attendance review board (SARB) established pursuant to Education Code 48321 or to the probation department pursuant to Education Code 48263
	 
	Referral of the student to a truancy mediation program operated by the county's district attorney or probation officer pursuant to Education Code 48260.6

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48290, the Governing Board is required to investigate any complaint that a parent/guardian has violated compulsory education laws. The following paragraph delegates this responsibility to the attendance supervisor and may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 48292, it is the responsibility of the attendance supervisor to file a criminal complaint against a parent/guardian who continually and willfully fails to respond to school attendance review board directives or services.
Upon receiving any complaint that a parent/guardian or other person having control or charge of a student has violated Education Code 48200-48341, the state compulsory education laws, the attendance supervisor shall investigate the matter and, if a violation is found, shall recommend referral to a SARB.  If the district is subsequently notified by the SARB that the parent/guardian continually and willfully has failed to respond to directives of the SARB or the services provided, the attendance supervisor shall refer the matter for possible prosecution in court in accordance with Education Code 48291-48292, as applicable.  (Education Code 48290-48292)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48273, the Board is required to assign appropriate officers and employees to provide the County Superintendent with a report of SARB referrals and requests for petitions to the juvenile court; see AR 5113.1 - Chronic Absence and Truancy.  The following paragraph is for use by districts that have delegated this responsibility to the attendance supervisor.
The attendance supervisor shall gather and transmit to the County Superintendent of Schools the number and types of referrals made to the SARB and of requests for petitions made to the juvenile court.  (Education Code 48273)


The attendance supervisor shall annually report student attendance data to the Superintendent or designee and the Governing Board. Such data shall include, by school, grade level, and each numerically significant student subgroup as defined in Education Code 52052, rates of school attendance, chronic absence in which students are absent on 10 percent of more of the school days in the school year, and dropout.
