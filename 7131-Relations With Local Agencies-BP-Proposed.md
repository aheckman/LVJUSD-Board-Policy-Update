## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the importance of collaborating and communicating with other local agencies in order to provide the best possible school facilities and to allocate facility resources in an effective and efficient manner.  The Board and District staff shall consult and coordinate with local agencies as required by law and whenever the expertise and resources of these agencies can assist the District in the planning, design and construction of facilities.

Following notification by a city or county of proposed action to adopt or substantially revise a general plan, the Board may request a meeting with the local planning agency to discuss possible methods of coordinating planning, design and construction of new school facilities and school sites.  (Government Code 65352.2)

The Superintendent or designee shall monitor land development proposals within District boundaries and shall ensure that an exchange of accurate information is maintained with city/county planning staff regarding the impact of land development on the District's educational programs and facility needs.

Recognizing that available funds may not suffice to eliminate overcrowding in District schools caused by new development, the Board urges the city/county to adopt in its general plan or other appropriate planning documents, to the extent permitted by law, a provision which ensures that adequate school facilities will be available.

Notifications to Other Local Agencies

The Board shall notify the city council or county board of supervisors whenever it finds, based on clear and convincing evidence:  (Government Code 65971)


	That conditions of overcrowding exist in one or more attendance areas within the District which will impair the normal functioning of the educational programs, and the reason for the existence of those conditions
	 
	That all reasonable methods of mitigating conditions of overcrowding have been evaluated and no feasible method for reducing those conditions exists

The above notice shall specify the mitigation measures considered by the District and shall include a completed application to the Office of Public School Construction for preliminary determination of eligibility for school construction under applicable state law.  (Government Code 65971)

The Superintendent or designee shall notify the appropriate city or county planning agency of the adoption of a school facility needs analysis or facilities master plan, the acquisition of a school site, or other action regarding school facilities in accordance with law.
