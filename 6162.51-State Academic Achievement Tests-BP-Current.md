## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 60600-60649 establish the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP). See the accompanying administrative regulation for a list of assessments included in the CAASPP and program requirements.ill occur in the 2014-15 school year unless the State Board of Education (SBE) determines that the assessments cannot be fully implemented at that time. In addition, Education Code 60640, as amended, requires the SBE to adopt a primary language assessment that will be administered no later than the 2016-17 school year and to make recommendations by March 1, 2016, for expanding the CAASPP to include additional subjects and assessment methods. 
The Governing Board recognizes that state achievement test results provide an indication of student progress in achieving state academic standards and may be used to promote high-quality teaching and learning. The Superintendent or designee shall administer mandatory student assessments within the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) as required by law and in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation.

CSBA NOTE: The level of student participation in state assessments is a factor in the state accountability system. Pursuant to 20 USC 6311, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (P.L. 114-95), states must annually measure the achievement of not less than 95 percent of all students. Thus, districts must not discourage any individual student or group of students from participating. See the accompanying administrative regulation for further information about exemptions from testing.
The Board strongly encourages all students at the applicable grade levels to participate in the state assessments in order to maximize the usefulness of the data and enable the district to meet participation levels required for state and federal accountability systems. The Superintendent or designee shall notify students and parents/guardians about the importance of these assessments and shall develop strategies to encourage student participation.  Students shall be exempted from participation only in accordance with law and administrative regulation.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Education Code 52052 requires that schools and districts demonstrate comparable improvement in academic achievement by all numerically significant subgroups, including ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and homeless students, when the subgroup consists of at least 30 students with a valid test score or 15 foster youth or homeless students; see BP 0500 - Accountability. In addition, Education Code 52060 requires that the district's local control and accountability plan include annual goals to be achieved for all students and for each numerically significant subgroup; see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan. 
The Board shall annually examine state assessment results by school, grade level, and student subgroup as one measure of the district's progress in attaining its student achievement goals and shall revise the local control and accountability plan and other district or school plans as necessary to improve student achievement for underperforming student groups.
