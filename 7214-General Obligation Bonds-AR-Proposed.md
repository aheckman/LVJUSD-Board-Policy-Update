Election Notice

Whenever the Board of Education orders an election on the question of whether general obligation bonds shall be issued to pay for school facilities, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that election notice and ballot requirements comply with Education Code 15120-15126 and 15272, as applicable, and the section "Ballot Materials" below.

At least 88 days prior to the date of the election, the Superintendent or designee shall deliver to the officer conducting the election the resolution calling the election, including the date and purpose of the election, the authority for ordering the election and the specification of the election order, the signature of the officer or the clerk of the Board authorized to make such designations, and all other applicable ballot materials.   (Education Code 5322)

Ballot Materials

The ballot question to appear on the ballot shall not exceed 75 words and shall appear in the form specified in Elections Code 13119.  (Education Code 5322)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the ballot materials comply with applicable laws including a brief statement of the measure setting forth the amount of the bonds to be voted upon, the maximum rate of interest, and the purposes for which the proceeds of the sale of the bonds are to be used.  (Education Code 15122)

In addition to the 75 word ballot question, a separate statement shall be included with the sample ballot, which includes the best estimate from official sources of all of the following:  (Elections Code 9401)

	The average annual tax rate that would be required to be levied to fund the bond issue over the entire duration of the bond debt service, based on assessed valuations available at the time of the election or a projection based on experience within the same jurisdiction or other demonstrable factors
	
	The estimate shall also identify the final fiscal year in which the tax is anticipated to be collected.
	 
	The highest tax rate that would be required to be levied to fund the bond issue, and an estimate of the year in which that rate will apply, based on assessed valuations available at the time of the election or a projection based on experience within the same jurisdiction or other demonstrable factors
	 
	The total debt service, including the principal and interest, that would be required to be repaid if all the bonds are issued and sold
	
	The estimate may include information about the assumptions used to determine the estimate.

For bond measures requiring 55 percent majority of the voters, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the text of the ballot measure includes a statement that the Board will appoint a citizens' oversight committee and that annual independent audits will be conducted to assure that funds are spent only on school and classroom improvements and for no other purposes.  (Education Code 15272)

For bond funded projects that require state matching funds, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure the sample ballot contains a statement advising the voters that the project is subject to the approval of state matching funds and, therefore, passage of the bond measure is not a guarantee that the project will be completed.  (Education Code 15122.5)

Arguments in support or in opposition of the bond measure shall be submitted in accordance with Elections Code 9160-9170.

Citizens' Oversight Committee

If a bond is approved under the 55 percent majority threshold pursuant to Proposition 39 to the California Constitution, Article 13A, Section 1(b)(3) and Article 16, Section 18(b), then the District's citizens' oversight committee shall consist of at least seven members, including, but not limited to:  (Education Code 15282)

Members of the citizens' oversight committee may serve for no more than three consecutive terms of two years each. They shall serve without compensation.  (Education Code 15282)

	Ensuring that bond revenues are expended only for the purposes described in California Constitution, Article 13A, Section 1(b)(3), including the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including the furnishing and equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities
	 
	Ensuring that, as prohibited by California Constitution, Article 13A, Section 1(b)(3)(A), no funds are used for any teacher and administrative salaries or other school operating expenses

In furtherance of its purpose, the committee may engage in any of the following activities:  (Education Code 15278)

		Recommendations regarding the joint use of core facilities
		 
		Mechanisms designed to reduce costs by incorporating efficiencies in school site design
		 
		Recommendations regarding the use of cost-effective and efficient reusable facility plans
	
	

The District shall, without expending bond funds, provide the citizens' oversight committee with any necessary technical assistance and shall provide administrative assistance in furtherance of the committee's purpose and sufficient resources to publicize the committee's conclusions. The District shall also provide the citizens' oversight committee with responses to any and all findings, recommendations, and concerns addressed in the annual independent financial and performance audits within three months of receiving the audits.  (Education Code 15280)

All citizens' oversight committee proceedings shall be open to the public and noticed in the same manner as proceedings of the Board. Committee meetings shall be subject to the provisions of the Ralph M. Brown Act.  (Education Code 15280; Government Code 54952)

The citizens' oversight committee shall issue regular reports, at least once a year, on the results of its activities. Minutes of the proceedings and all documents received and reports issued shall be a matter of public record and shall be made available on the District's website.  (Education Code 15280)
