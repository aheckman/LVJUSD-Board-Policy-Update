## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation is for use by any district that maintains grades 9-12 and which may wish to enroll a nonimmigrant foreign student who is in the United States on an F-1 visa. Pursuant to 8 USC 1184, an F-1 visa may be granted to enable a nonimmigrant student to attend public school in grades 9-12 for a maximum of one year. Pursuant to 8 CFR 214.3, any district that desires to enroll such students is required to file a petition for certification with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), using the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The certification is renewable every two years. A web-based training course, "SEVIS Training for School Officials," is available on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's web site.This program is different from the international exchange program in which high school students from other countries are allowed into the United States to study at a sister or partner California school under the sponsorship of a government-approved agency. For information on the international exchange program, see BP/AR 6145.6 - International Exchange.
The Superintendent or designee shall, on behalf of the district, seek and obtain from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification of eligibility to enroll nonimmigrant foreign students in district schools and recertification for the continuing eligibility of the district every two years.  (8 CFR 214.3)

CSBA NOTE: Nonimmigrant students who are in the United States with an F-1 visa are, by definition, nonresidents. Pursuant to 8 USC 1184, such individuals are required to pay tuition in an amount equal to the unsubsidized per-student cost of providing education at the school for the period of the student's attendance. This requirement for payment of tuition may not be waived by the district and, according to the U.S. Department of State's publication, Foreign Students (F-1) in Public Schools, is applicable notwithstanding the fact that the student resides with a relative who is a U.S. citizen. Districts should make a reasonable estimate of the per-student cost of education when determining the tuition since no specific guidance has been provided for calculating the cost of attendance.
On a case-by-case basis, the Superintendent or designee may accept for admission into any of grades 9-12 any nonimmigrant foreign student with or seeking an F-1 visa.  Any such student shall be admitted for a maximum of one year and shall pay the district the full, unsubsidized per-student cost of attendance at the school.  (8 USC 1184)

In determining whether to admit a student, the Superintendent or designee shall consider whether the following conditions exist:  (8 CFR 214.3; 22 CFR 41.61)

	A suitable program exists at the school the student has selected.
	 
	The student's English proficiency is sufficient for successful study at that school.
	 
	Space is available at the school.
	 
	The student has provided proof of financial responsibility.

In addition to fulfilling all other requirements for school entry, the student shall submit evidence that he/she has been fully immunized in accordance with California law.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 8 CFR 214.3, districts are required to comply with special recordkeeping requirements regarding nonimmigrant foreign students.
In accordance with law, the Superintendent or designee shall retain and, when required, report to DHS any records for nonimmigrant foreign students required for the operation of the SEVP.  Upon request, he/she also shall furnish to DHS representatives other records maintained by the district for nonimmigrant foreign students.  (8 CFR 214.3)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any individual dealing with enrollment of nonimmigrant foreign students is trained on the use of the Student Exchange Visitor Information System.
