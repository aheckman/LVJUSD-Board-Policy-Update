## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35291 requires the Governing Board to prescribe rules and regulations for maintaining discipline in the schools under its jurisdiction. While many of the required rules and regulations are in BP/AR 5144.1 - Suspension And Expulsion/Due Process, the following administrative regulation addresses special procedures required when disciplining students who have been identified for special education and related services. This administrative regulation reflects the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (20 USC 1400-1482), implementing federal regulations (34 CFR 300.1-300.818), and conforming state legislation. Note that in cases where state law provides greater protections to students, state law supersedes federal law.The U.S. Department of Education's, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), "Positive, Proactive Approaches to Supporting Children with Disabilities: A Guide for Stakeholders," recommends that districts identify ways to significantly reduce the use of exclusionary discipline, and its disproportionate effect on students with disabilities. See BP 6120 - Response To Instruction And Intervention and BP/AR 6164.5 - Student Success Teams.Neither state nor federal law requires that these procedures apply to students identified under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 794). However, the U.S. Department of Education's, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), "Fact Sheet: Supporting Students with Disabilities and Avoiding the Discriminatory Use of Student Discipline Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973," provides that, for a student with a disability under Section 504, schools are required to conduct a manifestation determination before implementing a disciplinary removal that will significantly change the placement of the student due to discipline for (1) removal from class or school for more than 10 consecutive school days, or (2) a series of removals from class or school that together total more than 10 school days in a school year and constitute a pattern of removal. Districts that wish to apply all IDEA procedures to Section 504 students should modify the following regulation accordingly.OSER's 2022, "Dear Colleague Letter on Implementation of IDEA Discipline Provisions," cautions that while IDEA does not preclude a district from disciplining a child with a disability, disparities in the use of discipline may arise when implementing IDEA's discipline provisions. OCR and the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division's May 2023, "Resource on Confronting Racial Discrimination in Student Discipline," provides additional resources and findings which address unlawful discrimination in the administration of student discipline.Additionally, the U.S. Department of Education's 2023 publication, "Guiding Principles for Creating Safe, Inclusive, Supportive, and Fair School Climates," provides that schools should objectively define disciplinary infractions in order to reduce subjectivity and ensure that consequences are administered consistently and fairly without regard to race, sex, disability, or other student characteristics.Due to the complexity of the issue, districts should proceed carefully when suspending or expelling students with disabilities and consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel as appropriate.
A student identified as an individual with a disability pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 USC 1400-1482, is subject to the same grounds and procedures for suspension and expulsion which apply to students without disabilities, except as otherwise specified in this administrative regulation.

Suspension or expulsion of a student with disabilities shall be in accordance with Board Policy 5144.1 - Suspension And Expulsion/Due Process and this administrative regulation.

When a student with disabilities exhibits behavior which impedes the student's own learning or that of others, the student's individualized education program (IEP) team shall consider positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address the behavior.  (Education Code 56521.2; 20 USC 1414)

Suspension

CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to 20 USC 1415(k)(1), 34 CFR 300.530, and the 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision Honig v. Doe, districts receiving funds under the IDEA may suspend a student with a disability for up to 10 consecutive school days, as long as the removal does not constitute a change in placement pursuant to 34 CFR 300.536. However, pursuant to Education Code 48911, unless the student has been recommended for expulsion or suspended directly by the Board, a student may be suspended for no more than five consecutive school days for a given incident. The more restrictive law, which in this case is state law, applies. Pursuant to Education Code 48903, a student may not typically be suspended for more than 20 cumulative school days in a school year.The Analysis of Comments to the federal regulations, 71 Fed. Reg. 156, pg. 46715, explains that whether a bus suspension or "in-school suspension" would count as a day of suspension affecting the cumulative total depends on the unique circumstances of each case, such as whether bus transportation is part of the student's individualized education program (IEP). An "in-school suspension" or "supervised suspension classroom" as authorized by Education Code 48911.1 would not count towards the limit as long as the student is afforded the opportunity to continue to appropriately participate in the general curriculum, receive the services specified in the student's IEP, and participate with nondisabled students to the extent the student would have in the current placement. The district should be careful that such actions do not constitute a change of placement and carefully monitor such suspensions.It is recommended that districts with questions regarding suspension of a student with disabilities consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
The Superintendent, principal, or designee may suspend a student from school for up to five consecutive school days, unless the suspension has been extended following a recommendation for expulsion. (Education Code 48911)
A student may usually be suspended from school for up to 20 cumulative school days, or 30 cumulative school days as permitted by Education Code 48903, in a school year as long as the pattern of suspension(s) does not constitute a change in placement pursuant to 34 CFR 300.536.  (Education Code 48903; 34 CFR 300.530)

The Superintendent or designee shall determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a pattern of removals of a student from the student's current educational placement for disciplinary reasons constitutes a change of placement.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 34 CFR 300.536, a change of placement is deemed to occur when a student with disabilities is removed for more than 10 consecutive school days. However, Education Code 48911 limits the suspension of a student to no more than five consecutive school days, unless that suspension is imposed directly by the Board pursuant to Education Code 48912 or the student's suspension has been extended pending expulsion. Because the more restrictive law applies, which in this case is state law, a student may usually be suspended for no more than five consecutive school days.
A change of placement shall be deemed to have occurred under either of the following circumstances:  (34 CFR 300.536)

	A decision has been made that would result in the removal of the student for more than 10 consecutive school days
	 
	The student has been subjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern because of all of the following:
	 
	
		The series of removals total more than 10 school days in a school year
		 
		The student's behavior is substantially similar to the student's behavior in previous incidents that resulted in the series of removals
		 
		Additional factors, such as the length of each removal, the total amount of time the student has been removed, and the proximity of the removals to one another
	
	

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 1412(a)(1)(A) and 34 CFR 300.530, a "free appropriate public education" (FAPE) must be available to all students, including any student with a disability who has been suspended for more than 10 school days in the same school year. The Analysis of Comments to the federal regulations, 71 Fed. Reg. 156, pg. 46716, clarifies that the district is not required to provide a student who has been suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons exactly the same services in exactly the same setting as the student was receiving prior to the imposition of discipline. However, the special education and related services the student does receive must enable the student to continue to participate in the general curriculum and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the student's IEP. The Analysis of Comments, 71 Fed. Reg. 156, pg. 46717, clarifies that services need not be provided when a student is removed for 10 school days or less, as long as the district does not provide services to nondisabled students removed for the same amount of time.
If a student's removal is determined to be a change of placement as specified in Items #1-2 above, the student's IEP team shall determine the appropriate educational services. Such services shall be designed to enable the student to continue to participate in the general education curriculum in another setting, to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the student's IEP, and to address the student's behavior violation so that it does not recur.  (20 USC 1412(a)(1)(A); 34 CFR 300.530)

If the IEP of a student with a disability requires the district to provide the student with transportation, the district shall provide the student with an alternative form of transportation at no cost to the student or the student's parent/guardian when, as a result of a suspension, the student is excluded from school bus transportation.  (Education Code 48915.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional.
The principal or designee shall monitor the number of days, including portions of days, in which a student with an IEP has been suspended during the school year.

Interim Alternative Educational Placement Due to Dangerous Behavior

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 1415(k) and 34 CFR 300.530 permit an interim alternative placement for 45 school days when a student with a disability, while on school grounds, while going to or coming from school, or at a school function, either (1) carries or possesses a weapon, (2) knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or solicits the sale of a controlled substance, or (3) inflicts serious bodily injury upon another person. "Serious bodily injury" is defined in 18 USC 1365 as bodily injury which involves a substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty. This alternative placement decision may be made unilaterally by the district.The term "weapon," as used below, refers to a "dangerous weapon" as defined in 18 USC 930 and includes any device which is capable of causing death or serious bodily injury. The term does not include a pocket knife with a blade of less than 2 1/2 inches in length.
The district may unilaterally place a student with a disability in an appropriate interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days, without regard to whether the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability, when the student commits one of the following acts while at school, going to or from school, or at a school-related function:  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(G); 34 CFR 300.530)

	Carries or possesses a weapon, as defined in 18 USC 930
	 
	Knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs
	 
	Sells or solicits the sale of a controlled substance as identified in 21 USC 812(c), Schedules I-V
	 
	Inflicts serious bodily injury upon another person as defined in 18 USC 1365

The student's interim alternative educational setting shall be determined by the student's IEP team.  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(G); 34 CFR 300.531)

CSBA NOTE: For requirements of the procedural safeguards notice, see AR 6159.1 - Procedural Safeguards And Complaints For Special Education.
On the date the decision to take disciplinary action is made, the student's parent/guardian shall be notified of the decision and provided the procedural safeguards notice pursuant to 34 CFR 300.504.  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(H); 34 CFR 300.530)

A student who has been removed from the student's current placement because of dangerous behavior shall receive services, although in another setting, to the extent necessary to allow the student to participate in the general education curriculum and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the IEP. As appropriate, the student shall also receive a functional behavioral assessment and behavioral intervention services and modifications that are designed to address the behavior violation, so that it does not recur.  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(D); 34 CFR 300.530)

Manifestation Determination

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 34 CFR 300.530 and 300.536, a manifest determination meeting must be held within 10 school days of the decision to change a student's placement. A change of placement occurs when a student is, or would be, removed for more than 10 consecutive school days or the student has been subjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern. However, Education Code 48911 limits the suspension of a student to no more than five consecutive school days, unless the student has been recommended for expulsion, or the student has been suspended by the Board pursuant to Education Code 48912.A student with a disability who is also a foster youth or Indian child is afforded additional due process safeguards. Pursuant to Education Code 48853.5 and 48915.5, a foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, and an Indian child's tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker, have the same rights as a parent/guardian to receive a suspension notice, expulsion notice, manifestation determination notice and invitation to the manifestation determination meeting, involuntary transfer notice, and other documents and related information, as reflected in Items #1 and 2 below. See AR 5144.1 - Suspension And Expulsion/Due Process and BP/AR 6184 - Continuation Education.
The following procedural safeguards shall apply when a decision has been made to suspend a student with a disability for more than 10 consecutive school days, when a series of removals of a student constitutes a pattern, or when a change of placement of a student is contemplated due to a violation of the district's code of conduct:

	Notice: On the date the decision to take disciplinary action is made, the student's parent/guardian shall be notified of the decision and provided the procedural safeguards notice pursuant to 34 CFR 300.504
	
	If the student is a foster youth, the notice shall be given to the student's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, and, if the student is an Indian child, the student's tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker.  (Education Code 48853.5; 20 USC 1415(k)(1)(H); 34 CFR 300.530)
	 
	Manifestation Determination Review: Immediately if possible, but in no case later than 10 school days after the date the decision to take disciplinary action is made, a manifestation determination review shall be made of the relationship between the student's disability and the behavior subject to the disciplinary action  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(E); 34 CFR 300.530)
	
	If the student is a foster youth or Indian child, the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, or county social worker, or the Indian child's tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker, shall be invited to participate in the manifestation determination review.  (Education Code 48915.5)
	
	At the manifestation determination review, the district, the student's parent/guardian, and relevant members of the IEP team (as determined by the district and parent/guardian) shall review all relevant information in the student's file, including the student's IEP, any teacher observations, and any relevant information provided by the parents/guardians, to determine whether the conduct in question was either of the following:  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(E); 34 CFR 300.530)
	 
	
		Caused by or had a direct and substantial relationship to the student's disability
		 
		A direct result of the district's failure to implement the student's IEP, in which case the district shall take immediate steps to remedy those deficiencies
		
		If the manifestation review team determines that either of the above conditions applies, the student's conduct shall then be determined to be a manifestation of the student's disability.  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(E); 34 CFR 300.530)
		 
	
	
	Determination that Behavior is a Manifestation of the Student's Disability: When the student's conduct has been determined to be a manifestation of the student's disability, the IEP team shall conduct a functional behavioral assessment, unless one had been conducted before the occurrence of the behavior that resulted in the change of placement, and shall implement a behavioral intervention plan for the student
	
	If a behavioral intervention plan has already been developed, the IEP team shall review the behavioral intervention plan and modify it as necessary to address the behavior.  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(F); 34 CFR 300.530)
	
	The student shall be returned to the placement from which the student was removed, unless the parent/guardian and Superintendent or designee agree to a change of placement as part of the modification of the behavioral intervention plan.  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(F); 34 CFR 300.530)
	 
	Determination that Behavior is Not a Manifestation of the Student's Disability: When it has been determined that the student's conduct was not a manifestation of the disability, the student may be disciplined in accordance with the procedures for students without disabilities
	
	However, the student's IEP team shall determine services necessary to enable the student to participate in the general education curriculum in another setting and to allow the student to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the IEP.  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(D); 34 CFR 300.530)
	
	As appropriate, the student also shall receive a functional behavioral assessment and behavioral intervention services and modifications that are designed to address the behavior violation so that it does not recur.  (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(D); 34 CFR 300.530)

Due Process Appeals

CSBA NOTE: As specified below, 34 CFR 300.532 provides that either the district or the parent/guardian may appeal a placement decision by filing a due process complaint pursuant to 34 CFR 300.507 and 300.508. For details regarding the due process complaint, see BP/AR 6159.1 - Procedural Safeguards And Complaints For Special Education. In addition, the district may file a request that the hearing officer order a change of placement to an interim alternative setting for up to 45 days when the hearing officer determines that maintaining the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the student or others.The Analysis of Comments to the federal regulations, 71 Fed. Reg. 156, pg. 46723, clarifies that the burden of proof in due process hearings is on the party that is responsible for the issue going forward to the due process hearing officer, consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Schaffer v. Weast. Thus, if the district has requested that a hearing officer remove a student to an interim alternative educational setting, the burden of persuasion at the hearing is on the district.
If the parent/guardian disagrees with any district decision regarding placement under 34 CFR 300.530 (suspension and removal for dangerous circumstances), 34 CFR 300.531 (interim alternative placement), or the manifestation determination under 34 CFR 300.530(e), the parent/guardian may appeal the decision by requesting a hearing. The district may request a hearing if the district believes that maintaining the student's current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the student or others. In order to request a due process hearing, the requesting party shall file a complaint pursuant to 34 CFR 300.507 and 300.508(a) and (b).  (20 USC 1415(k)(3); 34 CFR 300.532)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 34 CFR 300.532, this due process hearing is the same as the impartial due process hearing held for other special education matters, except that the law specifies expedited timelines. For other due process hearing requirements, see BP/AR 6159.1 - Procedural Safeguards And Complaints For Special Education.
Whenever a hearing is requested as specified above, the parent/guardian or the district shall have an opportunity for an expedited due process hearing consistent with requirements specified in 34 CFR 300.507, 300.508 (a)-(c), and 300.510-300.514.

If the student's parent/guardian or the district has initiated a due process hearing under 34 CFR 300.532 as detailed above, the student shall remain in the interim alternative educational setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the 45-day time period, whichever occurs first, unless the parent/guardian and district agree otherwise.  (20 USC 1415(k)(4); 34 CFR 300.533)

Readmission

CSBA NOTE: There is no state or federal law that requires special procedures for readmission of expelled students with disabilities; however, districts have an ongoing obligation to make FAPE available to students with disabilities.
Readmission procedures for students with disabilities shall be the same as those adopted for students without disabilities. Upon readmission of a student with disabilities, an IEP team meeting shall be convened to review and, as necessary, modify the student's IEP.

Decision Not to Enforce Expulsion Order

CSBA NOTE: For district criteria applicable to all students when the Board is considering whether to suspend the enforcement of an expulsion order, see BP 5144.1 - Suspension And Expulsion/Due Process. The district should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel when considering the suspension of an expulsion order involving a special education student.
The Governing Board's criteria for suspending the enforcement of an expulsion order shall be applied to students with disabilities in the same manner as they are applied to all other students.  (Education Code 48917)

Notification to Law Enforcement Authorities

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 1415(k)(6) and 34 CFR 300.535, the district is authorized to report crimes by students with disabilities to law enforcement in accordance with state law. Education Code 48902 provides procedures for these required notifications and Education Code 49076, requires any law enforcement authority to which information regarding a student with disabilities is disclosed to certify that those records will not be disclosed to another party without the prior written consent of the student's parent/guardian or other person invested with the student's educational right. See also AR 5144.1 - Suspension And Expulsion/Due Process and BP 5131.7 - Weapons And Dangerous Instruments.
Law enforcement notification requirements involving students with disabilities shall be the same as those specified for all students in Administrative Regulation 5144.1 - Suspension And Expulsion/Due Process.

When giving any required notification concerning a student with disabilities to any law enforcement official, the principal or designee shall require the law enforcement official to certify in writing that the student's information or records will not be disclosed to any other person without the prior written consent of the student's parent/guardian.  (Education Code 49076)

Report to County Superintendent of Schools

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48203 requires the Superintendent to report to the County Superintendent of Schools when any special education student has been expelled or suspended for more than 10 school days. Education Code 48203 specifies that it is the duty of the County Superintendent to examine the reports and, if any case exists in which the interest of the student or welfare of the state may need further examination, bring the reports to the attention of the Board and the County Board of Education.
The Superintendent or designee shall report to the County Superintendent of Schools when any special education student has been expelled or suspended for more than 10 school days. The report shall include the student's name, last known address, and the reason for the action.  (Education Code 48203)

Procedures for Students Not Yet Eligible for Special Education Services

A student who has not been determined to be eligible for special education and related services and who has violated the district's code of student conduct may nevertheless assert any of the protections under IDEA, if the district had knowledge of the student's disability.  (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)

Knowledge means that, before the occurrence of the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action, one of the following occurred:  (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)


	The parent/guardian, in writing, has expressed concern to district supervisory or administrative personnel, or to a teacher of the student, that the student is in need of special education or related services
	 
	The parent/guardian has requested an evaluation of the student for special education pursuant to 20 USC 1414(a)(1)(B) or 34 CFR 300.300-300.311
	 
	The teacher of the student or other district personnel has expressed specific concerns directly to the district's director of special education or other supervisory district personnel about a pattern of behavior demonstrated by the student

However, the district shall not be deemed to have knowledge of a student's disability if the student's parent/guardian has not allowed the student to be evaluated for special education services or has refused services or, after evaluating the student pursuant to 34 CFR 300.300-300.311, the district determined that the student was not an individual with a disability.  (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)

When the district is deemed to not have knowledge of a student's disability, the student shall be disciplined in accordance with procedures established for students without disabilities who engage in comparable behavior.  (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)

If a request is made for an evaluation of a student during the time period in which the student is subject to disciplinary measures pursuant to 34 CFR 300.530, the evaluation shall be conducted in an expedited manner. Until the evaluation is completed, the student shall remain in the educational placement determined by school authorities.  (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)

A student identified as an individual with a disability pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 USC 1400-1482, is subject to the same grounds and procedures for suspension and expulsion which apply to students without disabilities, except as otherwise specified in this administrative regulation.<br>
<br>
Suspension or expulsion of a student with disabilities shall be in accordance with Board Policy 5144.1 - Suspension And Expulsion/Due Process and this administrative regulation.<br>
<br>
When a student with disabilities exhibits behavior which impedes the student&#39;s own learning or that of others, the student&#39;s individualized education program (IEP) team shall consider positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address the behavior.&nbsp; (Education Code 56521.2; 20 USC 1414)<br>

<br>
<div id='YOA136' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to 20 USC 1415(k)(1), 34 CFR 300.530, and the 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision Honig v. Doe, districts receiving funds under the IDEA may suspend a student with a disability for up to 10 consecutive school days, as long as the removal does not constitute a change in placement pursuant to 34 CFR 300.536. However, pursuant to Education Code 48911, unless the student has been recommended for expulsion or suspended directly by the Board, a student may be suspended for no more than five consecutive school days for a given incident. The more restrictive law, which in this case is state law, applies. Pursuant to Education Code 48903, a student may not typically be suspended for more than 20 cumulative school days in a school year.<br><br>The Analysis of Comments to the federal regulations, 71 Fed. Reg. 156, pg. 46715, explains that whether a bus suspension or "in-school suspension" would count as a day of suspension affecting the cumulative total depends on the unique circumstances of each case, such as whether bus transportation is part of the student's individualized education program (IEP). An "in-school suspension" or "supervised suspension classroom" as authorized by Education Code 48911.1 would not count towards the limit as long as the student is afforded the opportunity to continue to appropriately participate in the general curriculum, receive the services specified in the student's IEP, and participate with nondisabled students to the extent the student would have in the current placement. The district should be careful that such actions do not constitute a change of placement and carefully monitor such suspensions.<br><br>It is recommended that districts with questions regarding suspension of a student with disabilities consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="EMjgMQ1" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22EMjgMQ1%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22YOA136%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1726002259%2C%22text%22%3A%22%20Pursuant%20to%2020%20USC%201415%28k%29%281%29%2C%2034%20CFR%20300.530%2C%20and%20the%201988%20U.S.%20Supreme%20Court%20decision%20Honig%20v.%20Doe%2C%20districts%20receiving%20funds%20under%20the%20IDEA%20may%20suspend%20a%20student%20with%20a%20disability%20for%20up%20to%2010%20consecutive%20school%20days%2C%20as%20long%20as%20the%20removal%20does%20not%20constitute%20a%20change%20in%20placement%20pursuant%20to%2034%20CFR%20300.536.%20However%2C%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2048911%2C%20unless%20the%20student%20has%20been%20recommended%20for%20expulsion%20or%20suspended%20directly%20by%20the%20Board%2C%20a%20student%20may%20be%20suspended%20for%20no%20more%20than%20five%20consecutive%20school%20days%20for%20a%20given%20incident.%20The%20more%20restrictive%20law%2C%20which%20in%20this%20case%20is%20state%20law%2C%20applies.%20Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2048903%2C%20a%20student%20may%20not%20typically%20be%20suspended%20for%20more%20than%2020%20cumulative%20school%20days%20in%20a%20school%20year.%5Cn%5CnThe%20Analysis%20of%20Comments%20to%20the%20federal%20regulations%2C%2071%20Fed.%20Reg.%20156%2C%20pg.%2046715%2C%20explains%20that%20whether%20a%20bus%20suspension%20or%20%5C%22in-school%20suspension%5C%22%20would%20count%20as%20a%20day%20of%20suspension%20affecting%20the%20cumulative%20total%20depends%20on%20the%20unique%20circumstances%20of%20each%20case%2C%20such%20as%20whether%20bus%20transportation%20is%20part%20of%20the%20student%27s%20individualized%20education%20program%20%28IEP%29.%20An%20%5C%22in-school%20suspension%5C%22%20or%20%5C%22supervised%20suspension%20classroom%5C%22%20as%20authorized%20by%20Education%20Code%2048911.1%20would%20not%20count%20towards%20the%20limit%20as%20long%20as%20the%20student%20is%20afforded%20the%20opportunity%20to%20continue%20to%20appropriately%20participate%20in%20the%20general%20curriculum%2C%20receive%20the%20services%20specified%20in%20the%20student%27s%20IEP%2C%20and%20participate%20with%20nondisabled%20students%20to%20the%20extent%20the%20student%20would%20have%20in%20the%20current%20placement.%20The%20district%20should%20be%20careful%20that%20such%20actions%20do%20not%20constitute%20a%20change%20of%20placement%20and%20carefully%20monitor%20such%20suspensions.%5Cn%5CnIt%20is%20recommended%20that%20districts%20with%20questions%20regarding%20suspension%20of%20a%20student%20with%20disabilities%20consult%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-EMjgMQ1" title="CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to 20 USC 1415(k)(1), 34 CFR ..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

<ol>
	<li>Notice: On the date the decision to take disciplinary action is made, the student&#39;s parent/guardian shall be notified of the decision and provided the procedural safeguards notice pursuant to 34 CFR 300.504<br>
	<br>
	If the student is a foster youth, the notice shall be given to the student&#39;s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, and, if the student is an Indian child, the student&#39;s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker.&nbsp; (Education Code 48853.5; 20 USC 1415(k)(1)(H); 34 CFR 300.530)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Manifestation Determination Review: Immediately if possible, but in no case later than 10 school days after the date the decision to take disciplinary action is made, a manifestation determination review shall be made of the relationship between the student&#39;s disability and the behavior subject to the disciplinary action&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(E); 34 CFR 300.530)<br>
	<br>
	If the student is a foster youth or Indian child, the foster youth&#39;s educational rights holder, attorney, or county social worker, or the Indian child&#39;s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker, shall be invited to participate in the manifestation determination review.&nbsp; (Education Code 48915.5)<br>
	<br>
	At the manifestation determination review, the district, the student&#39;s parent/guardian, and relevant members of the IEP team (as determined by the district and parent/guardian) shall review all relevant information in the student&#39;s file, including the student&#39;s IEP, any teacher observations, and any relevant information provided by the parents/guardians, to determine whether the conduct in question was either of the following:&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(E); 34 CFR 300.530)<br>
	&nbsp;
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>Caused by or had a direct and substantial relationship to the student&#39;s disability<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A direct result of the district&#39;s failure to implement the student&#39;s IEP, in which case the district shall take immediate steps to remedy those deficiencies<br>
		<br>
		If the manifestation review team determines that either of the above conditions applies, the student&#39;s conduct shall then be determined to be a manifestation of the student&#39;s disability.&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(E); 34 CFR 300.530)<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Determination that Behavior is a Manifestation of the Student&#39;s Disability: When the student&#39;s conduct has been determined to be a manifestation of the student&#39;s disability, the IEP team shall conduct a functional behavioral assessment, unless one had been conducted before the occurrence of the behavior that resulted in the change of placement, and shall implement a behavioral intervention plan for the student<br>
	<br>
	If a behavioral intervention plan has already been developed, the IEP team shall review the behavioral intervention plan and modify it as necessary to address the behavior.&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(F); 34 CFR 300.530)<br>
	<br>
	The student shall be returned to the placement from which the student was removed, unless the parent/guardian and Superintendent or designee agree to a change of placement as part of the modification of the behavioral intervention plan.&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(F); 34 CFR 300.530)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Determination that Behavior is Not a Manifestation of the Student&#39;s Disability: When it has been determined that the student&#39;s conduct was not a manifestation of the disability, the student may be disciplined in accordance with the procedures for students without disabilities<br>
	<br>
	However, the student&#39;s IEP team shall determine services necessary to enable the student to participate in the general education curriculum in another setting and to allow the student to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the IEP.&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(D); 34 CFR 300.530)<br>
	<br>
	As appropriate, the student also shall receive a functional behavioral assessment and behavioral intervention services and modifications that are designed to address the behavior violation so that it does not recur.&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(D); 34 CFR 300.530)</li>

For details regarding the due process complaint, see BP/AR 6159.1 - Procedural Safeguards And Complaints For Special Education.

The Superintendent or designee shall report to the County Superintendent of Schools when any special education student has been expelled or suspended for more than 10 school days.

<strong>Procedures for Students Not Yet Eligible for Special Education Services</strong><br>
<br>
A student who has not been determined to be eligible for special education and related services and who has violated the district&#39;s code of student conduct may nevertheless assert any of the protections under IDEA, if the district had knowledge of the student&#39;s disability.&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)<br>
<br>
<em>Knowledge </em>means that, before the occurrence of the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action, one of the following occurred:&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)

<ol>
	<li>The parent/guardian, in writing, has expressed concern to district supervisory or administrative personnel, or to a teacher of the student, that the student is in need of special education or related services<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The parent/guardian has requested an evaluation of the student for special education pursuant to 20 USC 1414(a)(1)(B) or 34 CFR 300.300-300.311<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The teacher of the student or other district personnel has expressed specific concerns directly to the district&#39;s director of special education or other supervisory district personnel about a pattern of behavior demonstrated by the student</li>
</ol>
However, the district shall not be deemed to have knowledge of a student&#39;s disability if the student&#39;s parent/guardian has not allowed the student to be evaluated for special education services or has refused services or, after evaluating the student pursuant to 34 CFR 300.300-300.311, the district determined that the student was not an individual with a disability.&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)<br>
<br>
When the district is deemed to not have knowledge of a student&#39;s disability, the student shall be disciplined in accordance with procedures established for students without disabilities who engage in comparable behavior.&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)<br>
<br>
If a request is made for an evaluation of a student during the time period in which the student is subject to disciplinary measures pursuant to 34 CFR 300.530, the evaluation shall be conducted in an expedited manner. Until the evaluation is completed, the student shall remain in the educational placement determined by school authorities.&nbsp; (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)</body>
