## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional regulation is for complaints concerning the content or use of any existing textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library, and should be modified to reflect district practice. Complaints alleging unlawful discrimination based on a violation of Education Code 243, related to the use or prohibited use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library, or Education Code 244, as added by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), related to the prohibited adoption or approval of use of any such materials if the use would subject a student to unlawful discrimination pursuant to Education Code 220, are required to be investigated or resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, or may be directly filed with the Superintendent of Public Instruction. For complaints regarding the sufficiency of instructional materials or textbooks pursuant to Education Code 35186, see AR/E(1)/E(2) 1312.4 - Williams Uniform Complaint Procedures.For policy related to  the selection, evaluation, and prohibited use of individual instructional materials, see BP/AR 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials, BP 6161.11 - Supplementary Instructional Materials, and BP 6163.1 - Library Media Centers. For more information regarding the adoption of instructional materials, see CSBA's, "Instructional Materials Adoptions: State and local governing board processes, roles, and responsibilities," "Instructional Materials Adoption: Local governing board responsibilities," and "State Roles, Responsibilities, and Process for Instructional Materials Adoption,"and the California Attorney General's, "Guidance to School Officials re: Legal Requirements for Providing Inclusive Curricula and Books."
Step 1:  Informal Complaint

If a staff member, district resident, or parent/guardian of a student enrolled in a district school has a complaint regarding the content or use of any specific instructional material, such individual shall informally discuss the material in question with the principal.  (Education Code 35160)

Step 2: Formal Complaint

If the complainant is not satisfied with the principal's initial response, the complainant shall present a written complaint to the principal. Complaints regarding printed material shall name the author, title, and publisher and shall identify the objection by page and item numbers. In the case of nonprinted material, written information specifying the precise nature of the objection and location of such material shall be given. In order for the district to reply appropriately, complainants shall sign all complaints and provide identifying information. Anonymous complaints will not be accepted.

Upon receiving a complaint, the principal shall provide the complainant with a written acknowledgement of its receipt and respond to any procedural questions the complainant may have. The principal shall then notify the Superintendent or designee, the teacher(s), and other staff as appropriate.

During the investigation of the complaint, the challenged material may remain in use until a final decision has been reached.

Step 3: Review Committee

The Superintendent or designee shall determine whether to convene a review committee to review the complaint.

If the Superintendent or designee determines that a review committee is necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall appoint a committee composed of administrators and staff members selected from relevant instructional and administrative areas. The Superintendent or designee may also appoint parents/guardians, students, and community members, as appropriate, to serve on the committee.

The Superintendent or designee may provide training to the review committee to ensure that the review committee is informed regarding its responsibilities, the criteria to follow when reviewing instructional materials, and applicable laws, Board policy(ies), and administrative regulation(s).

Within 30 days of being convened, the review committee shall summarize its findings in a written report. The Superintendent or designee shall notify the complainant in writing of the committee's decision within 15 days of receiving the committee's report.

Step 4:  Superintendent Determination

If the Superintendent or designee determines that a review committee is not necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall, in a timely manner, issue a decision regarding the complaint.

Step 5:  Appeal to the Governing Board

If the complainant remains unsatisfied, the complainant may appeal the Superintendent's or review committee's decision to the Governing Board. The Board's decision shall be final.
