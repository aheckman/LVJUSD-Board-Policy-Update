## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the value of District and school websites to communicate with students, parents/guardians, staff, and community members. The Superintendent or designee shall maintain District and school websites. The use of District and school websites shall support the District's vision and goals and be coordinated with other District communications strategies.

Design Standards

The Superintendent or designee shall establish design standards for District and school websites in order to maintain a consistent identity, professional appearance, and ease of use.

District design standards shall require an evaluation of products, features, and content accessible to students on District and school websites to prevent access to harmful or potentially harmful material.

The District's design standards shall address the accessibility of District and school websites to individuals with disabilities, including compatibility with commonly used assistive technologies.

Website Content

The Superintendent or designee shall develop content guidelines for District and school websites and assign staff to review and approve content prior to posting.

Board policy pertaining to advertising in District and school publications, as specified in Board Policy 1325 - Advertising and Promotion, shall also apply to advertising on District and school websites.

Privacy Rights

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the privacy rights of students, parents/guardians, staff, Board members, and other individuals are protected on District and school websites.

Telephone numbers and home and email addresses of students and/or their parents/guardians shall not be published on District or school websites.

The District regards photographs as a category of directory information that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Therefore, a student's photograph, together with the student's name, may be published on District or school websites unless the student's parent/guardian has notified the District in writing to not release the student's photograph without prior written consent, in accordance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 5125.1 - Release of Directory Information.

If students' names are not included, photographs of individual students or groups of students, such as at a school event, may be published on school or District websites.

Employees' home addresses, personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses shall not be posted on District or school websites.

The home address, telephone number, or both the name and assessor parcel number associated with the home address of any elected or appointed official including, but not limited to, a Board member or public safety official, shall not be posted on District or school websites without the prior written permission of that individual.  (Government Code 3307.5, 7928.205, 7920.535)

No public safety official shall be required to consent to the posting on the Internet of the public safety official's photograph or identity as a public safety officer for any purpose if that officer reasonably believes that the disclosure may result in a threat, harassment, intimidation, or harm to the officer or the officer's family.  (Government Code 3307.5)
