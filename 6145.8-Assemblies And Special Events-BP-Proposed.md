## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that assemblies and special events should promote a positive school climate and be related to the District's educational program.  Assemblies may provide information that supplements the District's curriculum or may showcase student achievement in academics, athletics, music, art, drama, or other extracurricular or cocurricular activities.

The principal shall ensure that speakers and community resources featured in school assemblies and special events are carefully selected and represent a balanced viewpoint.  Prospective speakers shall agree to present material of educational relevance that is appropriate to the maturity of the audience, with no statements that are obscene, vulgar, or that incite violence.

The principal shall schedule assemblies and special events so as to maximize the effectiveness of instructional time and to satisfy the requirements of law and negotiated agreements. 

During the assembly, students shall show respect to all performers and speakers.  Students who disrupt the program shall lose the privilege of attending the assembly and may be subject to disciplinary action.
