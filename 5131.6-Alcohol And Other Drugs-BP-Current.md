## Policy Content

The Governing Board believes that the use of alcohol or other drugs adversely affects a student's ability to achieve academic success, is physically and emotionally harmful, and has serious social and legal consequences. The Superintendent or designee shall develop comprehensive programs and activities to foster safe, healthy, and drug-free environments that support academic achievement.

CSBA NOTE: The Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants program (20 USC 7101-7122) may be used for several specified purposes, including activities to improve school conditions for student learning. For participating districts, 20 USC 7118 requires parent/guardian involvement in program activities and encourages partnerships with an institution of higher education, business, nonprofit organization, community-based organization, or other public or private entity. 20 USC 7116 requires specified groups to be consulted in the development of the grant application, including parents/guardians, teachers, principals, other school leaders, specialized instructional support personnel, students, community-based organizations, local government representatives (e.g., law enforcement, juvenile court, child welfare agency, public housing agency), Indian tribes or tribal organizations, charter school leaders and staff, and others with relevant and demonstrated expertise in alcohol and drug prevention and intervention.Additionally, Education Code 51268 encourages districts to collaborate with county offices of education in the provision of education programs for alcohol and drug prevention and to coordinate program planning and implementation with health, social services, criminal justice, and other entities.Pursuant to Education Code 49428.16, county offices of education are encouraged to establish a County Working Group on Fentanyl Education in Schools for the purposes of outreach, building awareness, and collaborating with local health agencies regarding fentanyl overdoses. Additionally, the California Department of Education is required to curate, and maintain on its website, informational materials containing awareness and safety advice, for staff, students, and parents/guardians, on how to prevent an opioid overdose, including any relevant information developed by a county working group and resource information on the provision of emergency naloxone hydrocholoride or other opioid antagonist.The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The district's alcohol and drug prevention and intervention programs shall be coordinated with other school and community-based services and programs and shall promote the involvement of parents/guardians. The Superintendent or designee may collaborate with the county office of education, community-based organizations, health providers, law enforcement agencies, local child welfare agencies, postsecondary institutions, businesses, and other public and private entities in program planning, implementation, and evaluation.

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-4 below reflect some of the types of programs that may be funded through the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Prevention and intervention programs and activities may include, but are not limited to:  (20 USC 7118)

	Evidence-based drug and violence prevention activities and programs that educate students against the use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, smokeless tobacco products, and electronic cigarettes

See BP/AR 5141.52 - Suicide Prevention.
The Superintendent or designee shall inform school staff, students, and parents/guardians about early warning signs, which may indicate alcohol and other drug use, and about appropriate agencies offering intervention programs, counseling, referral, and other student assistance programs.

CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to Education Code 48900, as amended by AB 2711 (Ch. 840, Statutes of 2024), students who voluntarily disclose their use of a tobacco product, controlled substance, alcohol, or an intoxicant of any kind in order to seek help through services or supports may not be suspended solely for that disclosure.
The Board strongly encourages any student who is using alcohol or drugs to discuss the matter with the student's parent/guardian or with any staff member. Students who disclose their use of alcohol or other drugs when seeking help from an intervention or recovery program shall not be disciplined for such use, including that, in accordance with Education Code 48900, students who voluntarily disclose their use of a tobacco product, controlled substance, alcohol, or an intoxicant of any kind in order to seek help through services or supports shall not be suspended.

Opioid Antagonists

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for districts that serve students in middle school, junior high school, high school, or adult school and should be modified to reflect the students served by the district. Pursuant to Education Code 49414.6, as added by SB 997 (Ch. 872, Statutes of 2024), a district may not prohibit a student in middle school, junior high school, or high school, while on a school site or participating in school activities, from carrying fentanyl test strips or a federally approved opioid antagonist for the emergency treatment of persons suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an opioid overdose.
Students in middle school, junior high school, high school, or adult school, may carry fentanyl test strips or a federally approved opioid antagonist for the emergency treatment of persons suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an opioid overdose, while on a school site or participating in a school activity.  (Education Code 49414.6)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for districts that serve students 12 years of age or older and may be deleted by districts that do not serve such students. Pursuant to Education Code 49414.35, as added by AB 2998 (Ch. 974, Statutes of 2024), districts may not prohibit students 12 years of age or older, while on a school site or participating in school activities, from carrying or administering, for the purposes of providing emergency treatment to persons who are suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an opioid overdose, a naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray or any other opioid overdose reversal medication. Students who administer such an opioid antagonist may not be held liable in a civil action or be subject to criminal prosecution due their acts or omissions, and the district and employees of the district may not be subject to professional review, liable in a civil action, or subject to criminal prosecution for a student's acts in administering an opioid antagonist, unless an act or omission of the students, employee, or district constitutes gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.
Additionally, students 12 years of age or older, while on a school site or participating in school activities, may carry and administer a naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray or any other opioid overdose reversal medication that is federally approved for over-the counter nonprescription use for the purpose of providing emergency treatment to persons who are suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an opioid overdose.  (Education Code 49414.35)

Enforcement and Discipline

Unless otherwise authorized by law, students shall not possess, use, or sell alcohol or other drugs and related paraphernalia on school grounds or at school-sponsored activities.

The Superintendent or designee shall clearly communicate to all students, staff, and parents/guardians the district's policies, regulations, and school rules related to the use of alcohol and other drugs.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48900, a student's unlawful possession, use, sale, or furnishing of alcohol or a controlled substance is a ground for suspension or expulsion; see AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process. Education Code 48915 requires immediate suspension and mandates expulsion for any student who sells a controlled substance at school or while under school jurisdiction. In addition, Education Code 48902 requires districts to notify law enforcement of any acts which may involve the possession or sale of narcotics or a controlled substance. However, when suspension and expulsion are not mandated, districts should consider whether it is appropriate to use an alternative discipline that maintains safety and order on campus and corrects student misbehavior without unnecessarily excluding students from school or discouraging them from seeking assistance for substance abuse.
Any student found by the Board to be selling a controlled substance listed in Health and Safety Code 11053-11058 shall be recommended for expulsion in accordance with Board Policy/Administrative Regulation 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process. A student found to have committed another drug or alcohol offense, including possession or intoxication, shall be referred to appropriate behavioral interventions or student assistance programs, and may be subject to discipline on a case-by-case basis.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49414.4, the district may, as part of a restorative justice framework and utilizing the Multi-Tiered System of Supports, use alternatives to a referral of a student to a law enforcement agency in response to an incident involving the student's misuse of an opioid.
The district may use alternatives to the referral of a student to a law enforcement agency in response to an incident involving the student's misuse of an opioid, to the extent any alternative utilized is not in conflict with any law requiring that referral.  (Education Code 49414.4)

Program Evaluation

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 7116, an application for Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants is required to include a description of how the district will periodically evaluate program effectiveness based on identified program objectives and outcomes. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Board and Superintendent shall agree upon performance measures that will be used to monitor and determine the effectiveness of district programs in reducing drug and alcohol use. The Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Board on the effectiveness of district activities in achieving identified objectives and outcomes.  (20 USC 7116)
