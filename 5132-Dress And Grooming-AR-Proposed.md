## Policy Content

In cooperation with teachers, students, and parents/guardians, the principal or designee may establish school rules governing student dress and grooming which are consistent with law, Board policy, and administrative regulations. These school dress codes shall be regularly reviewed.

The following guidelines shall apply to all regular school activities:


	Clothing, accessories, jewelry, and personal items shall be free of writing, pictures, symbols or any other insignia which is vulgar, lewd, obscene, profane, libelous, slanderous or sexually suggestive. Clothing, accessories, or jewelry that degrade any cultural, religious, or ethnic values, or that advocate racial, ethnic, or religious prejudice or discrimination, or that promote sex, violence, or the use of tobacco, drugs, or alcohol, or any unlawful acts are prohibited.
	 
	Shoes shall be worn at all times unless not required as part of an instructional activity.
	 
	Clothes shall be sufficient to conceal undergarments. See-through tops are prohibited.

The dress code shall be modified as appropriate to accommodate a student's religious or cultural observance, health condition, or other circumstance deemed necessary by the principal or designee. In addition, the principal or designee may impose dress requirements to accommodate the needs of special school activities, physical education classes, athletic activities, and other extracurricular and cocurricular activities.

No grade of a student participating in a physical education class shall be adversely affected if the student does not wear standardized physical education apparel because of circumstances beyond the student's control.  (Education Code 49066)

Students shall be allowed to wear sun-protective clothing, including but not limited to hats, for outdoor use during the school day.  (Education Code 35183.5)

Gang-Related Apparel

At individual schools that have a dress code prohibiting gang-related apparel at school or school activities, the principal, staff, and parents/guardians participating in the development of the school safety plan shall define "gang-related apparel" and shall limit this definition to apparel that reasonably could be determined to threaten the health and safety of the school environment if it were worn or displayed on a school campus.  (Education Code 32282)

Because gang-related symbols are constantly changing, definitions of gang-related apparel shall be reviewed at least once each semester and updated whenever related information is received. As necessary, the school shall collaborate with law enforcement agencies to update definitions of gang-related apparel.

Discipline Procedures

The following procedures and consequences shall be followed when there have been violations of the Student Dress Code. When practical, students shall not be directed to correct a dress code violation during instructional time or in front of other students.

First Referral

The student shall be brought to the school office, and a parent/guardian contact shall be made. The student shall receive a warning and shall be reminded of the dress code requirements by the principal or vice-principal. A change of clothes or removal of the inappropriate attire or item is required, students may pick up the inappropriate attire or item at the end of the school day. The student shall be sent home if necessary. The violation shall be documented.

Second Referral

The student shall be brought to the school office, and a parent/guardian contact shall be made. A
change of clothes or removal of the inappropriate attire is required. The inappropriate attire or item will be confiscated and returned to the student on the last day of the school week after a minimum of 5 instructional days. A parent/guardian contact shall be made and a conference may be held as necessary. The violation shall be documented.

Third Referral

The student shall be brought to the school office, and a parent/guardian contact shall be made. The student will be required to change and the inappropriate item will be returned at the end of the grading period to the student, or, earlier if provided directly to the parent upon request.
