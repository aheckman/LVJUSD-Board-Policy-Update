## Policy Content

The Board of Education is determined to provide a safe, positive environment where all District employees are assured of full and equal employment access and opportunities, protection from harassment and intimidation, and freedom from any fear of reprisal or retribution for asserting their employment rights in accordance with law. For purposes of this policy and accompanying administrative regulation, employees include interns, volunteers, contractors, job applicants, and other persons with an employment relationship with the District.

No District employee shall be discriminated against or harassed by any coworker, supervisor, manager, or other person with whom the employee comes in contact in the course of employment, on the basis of one, or a combination of two or more, protected characteristics which include, but may not be limited to, the employee's actual or perceived race or ethnicity; ancestry; color; ethnic group identification; nationality; national origin; immigration status; sex; sexual orientation; sex stereotypes; gender; gender identity; gender expression; religion; religious creed; age; disability; medical condition; genetic information; pregnancy, false pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or related conditions or recovery; reproductive health decision-making; breastfeeding or related medical conditions; and parental, marital, and family status; or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.  (Education Code 200, 210.1, 210.2, 212, 212.1, 220, 230, 260; Government Code 11135, 12920, 12926, 12940; 20 USC 1681-1688, 29 USC 621, 42 USC 2000d-2000d-7, 2000e-2)

The District shall not inquire into any employee's immigration status nor discriminate against an employee on the basis of immigration status, unless there is clear and convincing evidence that such inquiry is necessary to comply with federal immigration law.  (2 CCR 11028)

In addition, unless otherwise provided for in law, the District may not discriminate against an employee in any term or condition of employment, or otherwise penalize a person, including termination, based on the person's use of cannabis off the job and away from the workplace, or on a drug screening which finds that the person has nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolites in the person's hair, blood, urine, or other bodily fluid. However, the District retains the right to maintain drug-free schools or prohibit employees from possessing, being impaired by, or using cannabis while on the job.   (Government Code 12954)

Discrimination in employment based on the characteristics listed above is prohibited in all areas of employment and in all employment-related practices, including the following:

	Hiring, compensation, terms, conditions, and other privileges of employment
	 
	Taking adverse employment actions such as termination or denial of employment, promotion, job assignment, or training
	 
	Unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that is offensive and so severe or pervasive as to adversely affect an employee's employment opportunities or that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the employee's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment
	 
	Actions and practices identified as unlawful or discriminatory pursuant to Government Code 12940 or 2 CCR 11006-11086, such as:
	 
	
		Sex discrimination based on one, or a combination of two or more protected characteristics, which include, but may not be limited to, an employee's pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or any related medical condition, or on an employee's gender, gender expression, gender identity, or sexual orientation
		 
		Religious creed discrimination based on an employee's religious belief, observance, and practice, including religious dress or grooming practices, or based on the District's failure or refusal to use reasonable means to accommodate an employee's religious belief, observance, or practice which conflicts with an employment requirement
		 
		Requiring medical or psychological examination of a job applicant or making an inquiry into whether a job applicant has a mental or physical disability or a medical condition or as to the severity of any such disability or condition, without the showing of a job-related need or business necessity
		 
		Failure to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an employee or to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with an employee who has requested such accommodations in order to determine the effective reasonable accommodations, if any, to be provided to the employee
		 
		Requiring an employee to disclose information relating to the employee's reproductive health decision-making
		 
		Including a statement in a job advertisement, posting, application, or other material that an applicant is required to have a driver's license, unless the District reasonably expects driving to be one of the job functions for the position and reasonably believes that satisfying the job function using an alternative form of transportation would not be comparable in travel time or cost to the District
	
	

The Board also prohibits retaliation against any District employee who opposes any discriminatory employment practice by the District or its employees, agents, or representatives or who complains, reports an incident, testifies, assists, or in any way participates in the District's complaint process pursuant to this policy. No employee who requests an accommodation for any protected characteristic listed in this policy shall be subjected to any punishment or sanction, regardless of whether the request was granted.  (Government Code 12940; 2 CCR 11028)

No employee shall, in exchange for a raise or bonus or as a condition of employment or continued employment, be required to sign a release of the employee's claim or right to file a claim against the District or a nondisparagement agreement or other document that has the purpose or effect of preventing the employee from disclosing information about harassment, discrimination, or other unlawful acts in the workplace, including any conduct that the employee has reasonable cause to believe is unlawful.  (Government Code 12964.5)

Any supervisory or management employee who observes or has knowledge of an incident of prohibited discrimination or harassment, including harassment of an employee by a nonemployee, shall report the incident to the Superintendent or designated District coordinator within one workday. All other employees shall report such incidents to their supervisor or designated District coordinator within one workday.

The Superintendent or designee shall use all appropriate means to reinforce the District's nondiscrimination policy, including providing training and information to employees about how to recognize harassment, discrimination, or other prohibited conduct, how to respond appropriately, and components of the District's policies and regulations regarding discrimination. The Superintendent or designee shall regularly review the District's employment practices and, as necessary, shall take action to ensure District compliance with the nondiscrimination laws.

Any District employee who engages in prohibited discrimination, harassment, or retaliation or who aids, abets, incites, compels, or coerces another to engage or attempt to engage in such behavior in violation of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.

Complaints concerning employment discrimination, harassment, or retaliation shall immediately be investigated in accordance with procedures specified in the accompanying administrative regulation. However, complaints alleging sexual harassment under Title IX shall be investigated and resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in Administrative Regulation 4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 - Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures.

The District shall maintain and preserve all applications, personnel, membership, or employment referral records and files for at least four years after the records are initially created or received or, for an applicant or a terminated employee, for four years after the date the employment action was taken. However, when the District is notified that a complaint has been filed with the California Civil Rights Department, records related to the employee involved shall be maintained and preserved until the later of the first date after the time for filing a civil action has expired or the first date after the complaint has been fully and finally disposed of and all administrative proceedings, civil actions, appeals, or related proceedings have been terminated.  (Government Code 12946)
