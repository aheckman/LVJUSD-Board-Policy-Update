## Policy Content

Students may be excluded from attendance at District schools if they:


	Are under the legal age of attendance, except as otherwise provided by law. (Education Code 48210)
	 
	Do not present evidence of immunization from certain infectious diseases as required by law. (Health and Safety Code 120335, 120365, 120370)
	 
	Are reasonably suspected of having active tuberculosis. (Health and Safety Code 121485, 121495, 121505)
	 
	Are infected with any contagious or infectious disease. (Education Code 49451; 5 CCR 202)
	 
	Reside where any contagious, infectious, or communicable disease subject to quarantine exists or has recently existed, unless written permission of the health officer is provided. (Health and Safety Code 120230)
	 
	Have not had the health screening, specified in Health and Safety Code 124040, before or within the first 90 days of attending first grade. Such students may be excluded for up to five days unless the parent/guardian has presented a waiver or the District has exempted the student from this requirement in accordance with law. (Health and Safety Code 124105)


Notifications to Parents/Guardians

Prior to excluding a student from attendance, the Superintendent or designee shall send a notice to the student's parents/guardians stating the facts leading to the exclusion.

The Superintendent or designee may exclude a student without prior notice to the parents/guardians if the student is excluded because: (Education Code 48213)


	He/she resides in an area subject to quarantine pursuant to Health and Safety Code 120230
	 
	He/she is exempt from a medical examination but suffers from a contagious or infectious disease pursuant to Education Code 49451.
	 
	The Superintendent or designee determines that the presence of the student would constitute a clear and present danger to the safety or health of other students or school personnel.


However, in such cases, the Superintendent or designee shall send a notice as soon as reasonably possible after the exclusion. (Education Code 48213)

Appeals from Exclusion

Upon exclusion of his/her child, a parent/guardian may meet with the Superintendent or designee to discuss the exclusion. If the parents/guardians disagrees with the decision of the Superintendent or designee to exclude his/her child, he/she may appeal the decision to the Board of Education.

The parents/guardians shall have an opportunity to inspect all documents upon which the District is basing its decision, to challenge any evidence and question any witness presented by the District, to present oral and documentary evidence on the student's behalf, and to have one or more representatives present at the meeting.
