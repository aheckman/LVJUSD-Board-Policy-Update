## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to maximize staff and community confidence in District hiring, promotion, and other employment decisions by promoting practices that are free of conflicts of interest or the appearance of impropriety. 

The Board prohibits the appointment of any person to a position for which his/her relative maintains management, supervisory, evaluation, or promotion responsibilities and prohibits an employee from participating in any decision that singularly applies to any of his/her relatives.

For purposes of this policy, relative includes the individual's spouse, domestic partner, parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and the similar family of the individual's spouse or domestic partner.

In addition, the Superintendent or designee may determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether to appoint a person to a position in the same department or facility as an employee with whom he/she maintains a personal relationship when that relationship has the potential to create (1) an adverse impact on supervision, safety, security, or morale of other District employees or (2) a conflict of interest for the individuals involved which is greater because of the their relationship than it would be for another person.

An employee shall notify his/her supervisor within 30 days of any change in his/her circumstances that may constitute a violation of this policy.
