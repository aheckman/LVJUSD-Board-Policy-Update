## Policy Content

The Superintendent or designee shall post at every entrance to each school and school grounds a notice describing registration requirements, school hours or hours during which registration is required, the registration location, the route to take to that location, and the penalties for violation of registration requirements.  (Education Code 32211; Penal Code 627.6)

Unless otherwise directed by the principal or designee, a staff member shall accompany visitors while they are on school grounds.

Any person who is not a student or staff member shall register immediately upon entering any school building or grounds when school is in session.  (Education Code 35160)

Registration Procedure

In order to register, a visitor shall, upon request, furnish the principal or designee with the following information:  (Penal Code 627.3)

	Name, address, and occupation
	 
	Age, if less than 21
	 
	Purpose for entering school grounds
	 
	Proof of identity

Principal's Registration Authority

The principal or designee may refuse to register any visitor if the principal or designee reasonably concludes that the individual's presence or acts would disrupt the school, students, or employees; would result in damage to property; or would result in the distribution or use of a controlled substance. The principal or designee may revoke any visitor's registration if there is a reasonable basis for concluding that the individual's presence on school grounds would interfere, or is interfering, with the peaceful conduct of school activities or would disrupt or is disrupting the school, students, or staff.  (Penal Code 627.4)

When a visitor fails to register, or when the principal or designee denies or revokes a visitor's registration privileges, the principal or designee shall request that the individual promptly leave school grounds. If a visitor is shown reasonable cause to believe that the visitor is willfully disrupting the orderly operation of a school the principal or designee may issue a "Stay Away Letter" in accordance with Penal Code 626.4.

When a visitor is directed to leave, the principal or designee shall inform the visitor that if the visitor reenters the school within seven days the visitor may be guilty of a misdemeanor subject to a fine and/or imprisonment.  (Penal Code 627.7)

Appeal Procedure

Any person who is denied registration or whose registration is revoked may appeal either of these determinations by submitting, within five days after the person's departure from school, a written request for a hearing to either the Superintendent or the principal of the school at which the registration was denied or revoked. This request must state why the person believes the denial or revocation was improper and must provide an address to which the hearing notice may be sent. Upon receipt of the request for a hearing, the Superintendent or principal shall promptly mail a notice of the hearing to the person requesting it. A hearing before the Superintendent or principal shall be held within seven days after receipt of the request.  (Penal Code 627.5)
