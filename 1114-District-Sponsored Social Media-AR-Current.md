## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation may be revised to reflect district practice and the types of social media accounts used by the district.
Definitions

Social media means any online platform for collaboration, interaction, or active participation, or that allows users to post content, including, but not limited to, social networking sites such as Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X/Twitter, SnapChat, YouTube, and LinkedIn.

CSBA NOTE: To minimize liability to the district, it is important that the district clearly define the official social media accounts over which it has control and to specify the standards, guidelines, and protocols for their use. The following definition may be revised to reflect district practice. Board policies and administrative regulations do not apply to personal social media accounts that may be created by students, staff members, or other individuals which may sometimes include discussion of district-related issues but are not sponsored by the district.
An official district social media account is an account on a social media platform authorized by the Superintendent or designee.

An account that contains content related to the district or comments about district operations but that has not been created based on authorization or direction from the Superintendent or designee, such as an account created by a parent-teacher organization, booster club, or other school-connected organization or a student's or employee's personal account, is not an official district social media account.

School-level employees such as teachers and coaches shall obtain authorization from the school principal before creating an official social media account.

Guidelines for Content

Each official district social media account shall contain content that is useful and appropriate for all audiences.

CSBA NOTE: Federal copyright law (17 USC 107) and the courts have generally provided that teachers, students, and schools are allowed to make "fair use" of materials for instructional purposes in situations which are not likely to deprive a publisher or an author of income; see BP/AR 6162.6 - Use of Copyrighted Materials. However, as this is a fact-specific determination, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
District employees or agents in charge of posting or adding information to an official district social media account shall ensure that copyright laws are not violated in the use of material on official district social media accounts.

CSBA NOTE: Social media platforms typically allow users to post or reply to content on each other's accounts, which is or can be made viewable to other users and even the public. This may create a "limited public forum," which grants individuals certain freedom of speech rights and limits the district's ability to remove comments or posts. Any removal of content by the district should be based on viewpoint-neutral considerations to protect against possible legal challenges. This may include, but is not limited to, removing content that constitutes discrimination, harassment, or bullying, as specified in the accompanying Bboard Policy, or that is unrelated to the purpose of the account. Additionally, in order to help maintain the district's ability to remove content, users should be informed of the purpose of the account(s) and the limited nature of the discussion. District staff should regularly monitor all such accounts so that materials are removed as permitted by law. It is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel to ensure that any provisions related to removal of posts or discipline of students or staff are consistent with law.In Sears, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) advised caution when establishing policy related to employee use of electronic communications as it might interfere with an employee's right to engage in protected, concerted activity granted by 29 USC 157. The NLRB has held that social media policies can prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and address legitimate concerns for managing the workplace, but cannot expressly or by implication prohibit employees from talking with each other about wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.Additionally, Education Code 48907 grants students the right to freedom of speech except for speech which is obscene, libelous, or which so incites students as to create a clear and present danger of the commission of unlawful acts on school premises, violation of lawful school regulations, or substantial disruption of the orderly operation of the school. Also see BP/AR 5145.2 - Freedom of Speech/Expression and BP/AR 6145.5 - Student Organizations and Equal Access.Furthermore, if the district chooses to post advertising of a commercial nature on an official district social media account, then the ability to remove comments of a commercial nature posted by others may be limited as removing some commercial content and not others may constitute viewpoint discrimination. Districts should also be cautious about the use of district resources, such as its official district social media account, for political purposes; see BP 1160 - Political Processes.Pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Lindke v. Freed, a district official who limits or prevents critics from speaking, such as by blocking them on social media or deleting their posts, violates the First Amendment only if the official (1) has been granted the power to speak on behalf of the district and (2) claims to be actually exercising that power. Because the determination as to whether a public official's action meets these two conditions is a fact-specific undertaking, it is recommended that districts with questions regarding this issue consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that official district social media accounts are regularly monitored. Staff members responsible for monitoring content may remove posts or even suspend users from interacting with the account only based on viewpoint-neutral considerations, such as lack of relation to the account's purpose or violation of board policies or administrative regulations.

Each official district social media account shall, as appropriate, prominently display a link to this regulation or a statement that includes Items #1-10, below:

	The purpose(s) of the account, such as providing information to a class, school community, athletic team, or student club; engaging with the public regarding district decisions and Governing Board meetings; and sharing information regarding employment opportunities with the district
	 
	Users shall use the site only for those intended purposes
	 
	The account is regularly monitored and any inappropriate interaction will be promptly removed, blocked, or similarly addressed. Inappropriate interactions include, but are not limited to, interactions that:
	 
	
		Are obscene, libelous, or so incite students as to create a clear and present danger of the commission of unlawful acts on district premises, violation of district or school rules, or substantial disruption to the district or school's orderly operation
		 
		Are not related to the stated purpose of the account, including, but not limited to, threats, comments of a commercial nature, political activity, and comments prohibited by board policies and administrative regulations
		 
	
	
	Users are expected to communicate in a respectful, courteous, and professional manner and are personally responsible for their use of the account
	 
	The district is not responsible for the content posted by other users or how other users interact with the account
	 
	The views and comments expressed by other users on the account belong to those users and do not necessarily reflect the views of the district
	 
	Any user's reference to a specific commercial product or service does not imply endorsement or recommendation of that product or service by the district
	 
	The individual(s) to contact regarding violation of district guidelines on the use of official district social media accounts
	
	CSBA NOTE: The Cyberbullying Protection Act (Business and Professions Code 22589-22589.4) requires a social media platform, as defined, to establish a mechanism that allows any individual, including the district, to report cyberbullying or any content that violates the existing terms of service. Although not directly applicable to districts, it is good guidance for districts seeking to create a safe online space.
	Violations may be reported to the appropriate social media platform, law enforcement, or other third parties, as appropriate
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #10 details the length of and preconditions for a user's suspension and should be modified to reflect district practice.
	A user may be suspended from interacting with the account for one month upon three prior violations and for six months upon two prior one-month suspensions

Appropriate Use by District Employees

CSBA NOTE:  For policy language regarding appropriate employee communications and relationships with students, see BP 4119.21/4219.21/4319.21 - Professional Standards and BP 4040 - Employee Use Of Technology.
District employees who participate in official district social media accounts shall adhere to all applicable board policies and administrative regulations, including, but not limited to, professional standards related to interactions with students.

When appropriate, employees posting, replying, or otherwise interacting with the public outside of their professional duties or responsibilities on official district social media accounts shall identify themselves by name and district title and include a disclaimer stating that the views and opinions expressed in their post are theirs alone and do not necessarily represent those of the district or school.

All staff shall receive information about appropriate use of the official district social media accounts.
