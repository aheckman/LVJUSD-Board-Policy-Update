## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is mandated for districts that enter into a contract that (1) grants exclusive or nonexclusive sales or advertising for carbonated beverages, non-nutritious beverages, or non-nutritious foods, pursuant to Education Code 35182.5, or (2) is for digital storage, management, or retrieval of student records, or digital educational software that authorizes a third-party provider of digital educational software to access, store, and use student records, pursuant to Education Code 49073.1.Several statutes authorize the Governing Board to contract for services, equipment, materials, and supplies on behalf of the district. Such statutes include, but are not limited to, Education Code 17596, which allows a broad range of services to be performed under a "continuing contract" and Education Code 45103.5, which authorizes a contract for management consulting services relating to food service.Some contracts are subject to certain specific legal requirements which, if not complied with, may render the contract void or unenforceable. For instance, when contracting for the purchase of equipment, materials, or supplies in excess of the current bid limit ($114,800 for 2025), the district is required to seek competitive bids, pursuant to Public Contract Code 20111. Additionally, pursuant to Labor Code 1771.8, as added by SB 1303 (Ch. 991, Statutes of 2024), when contracting with a private labor compliance entity on a public works project, the private labor compliance entity is required to disclose a potential conflict of interest. See "Contracts for Non-nutritious Foods or Beverages," "Contracts for Electronic Products and Services," "Contracts for Digital Storage and Maintenance of Student Records," and "Contracts for Personal Services," below, for specific requirements and/or restrictions related to such contracts. See AR 3311.3 - Design-Build Contracts for information about design-build contracts for public works projects in excess of $1,000,000 and for alternative design-build projects in excess of $5,000,000. It is recommended that the district consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel when questions arise about legal requirements for specific contracts.
The Governing Board recognizes its responsibility to enter into contracts on behalf of the district for the acquisition of equipment, supplies, services, and other resources necessary for the achievement of district goals. In exercising this authority to enter into a contract, the Board shall ensure that the district's interests are protected and that the terms of the contract conform to any applicable legal standards, including, but not limited to, bidding requirements in Public Contract Code 20111.

CSBA NOTE: When entering into a contract, a district is required to comply with California's conflict of interest laws, including, but not limited to, Government Code 1090 (financial interest in a contract), Government Code 87100-87500 (Political Reform Act), and Government Code 84308 (conflict of interest from campaign contributions). The violation of any of these laws could result in cancelation of the contract and, in certain cases, the Board members and/or district officials implicated could be subject to civil and criminal penalties. For example, pursuant to Government Code 84308, as amended SB 1243 (Ch. 1017, Statutes of 2024), Board members are prohibited from participating in decisions involving parties who have provided campaign contributions of more than $500 in the prior 12 months. Additionally, pursuant to Public Contract Code 6102, a contract is voidable if entered into in violation of a state or federal crime relating to bribery of a public official, including, but not limited to, a violation of Penal Code 68 or 86.Additionally, Government Code 1097.6 clarifies that an independent contractor is not considered to be an "officer" and thereby not subject to the restrictions of Government Code 1090 when the district enters into a contract with an independent contractor to perform one phase of a project and later seeks to enter into a subsequent contract with that same independent contractor for another phase of the same project if the independent contractor's duties and services related to the initial contract did not include engaging in or advising on public contracting on behalf of the district.For more information related to the policy on conflict of interest, see BB 9270 - Conflict of Interest.
Board members and district employees involved in the making of contracts on behalf of the district shall comply with applicable law and the district's conflict of interest policy, as specified in Board Bylaw 9270 - Conflict of Interest.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to specify any desired limits to the delegation of authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the district. Pursuant to Education Code 35161, the Board may delegate any of its, or the district's, powers or duties authorized by law to an officer or employee of the district. However, the Board retains ultimate responsibility over the performance of such powers and duties. Additionally, pursuant to Education Code 17604 and 17605, the Board may adopt a rule delegating to any officer or employee the authority to purchase supplies, materials, apparatus, equipment, and services. The Board's rule is required to describe the limits of the delegation by prescribing time, money, and subject matter limits. The amount delegated may not be in excess of the amounts specified in Public Contract Code 20111, with any expenditures over those amounts required to be competitively bid. See BP 3300 - Expenditures and Purchases for language delegating the purchasing authority and setting the maximum limit.
The Board may, by a majority vote, delegate to the Superintendent or designee the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the district. To be valid or to constitute an enforceable obligation against the district, all such contracts must be approved and/or ratified by the Board.  (Education Code 17604, 17605, 35161)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 7928.801, any executed contract for the purchase of goods or services by the district, including the price and terms of payment, is a public record subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. Because other state and/or federal law may also be applicable when contracting for goods or services outside of California or pursuant to federal law, it is recommended that districts with questions about such contracts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
Unless otherwise exempt from disclosure under state or federal law, executed contracts for the purchase of goods or services, even if the contract contains provisions specifying that the contract is confidential or a proprietary record of the vendor, are public records to which members of the public shall have access.  (Government Code 7928.801)

No contract shall prohibit a district employee from disparaging the goods or services of any contracting party.  (Education Code 35182.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Labor Code 1771.8, as added by SB 1303, if the district utilizes a private labor compliance entity, that entity is required to submit a signed declaration under penalty of perjury verifying that it has no conflicts of interest. Pursuant to Labor Code 1771.8, as added by SB 1303, a violation of the conflict of interest provisions by a private labor compliance entity would void a contract between the parties and subject the private labor compliance entity to specified civil fines and fees. Because Labor Code 1771.8 does not apply to the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), LAUSD should delete the following four paragraphs.
If the district utilizes a private labor compliance entity, the Superintendent or designee shall verify that the entity does not have a conflict of interest.  (Labor Code 1771.8)

A private labor compliance entity is a third-party company hired by a district to perform labor compliance and enforcement activities on public works projects on the district's behalf.  (Labor Code 1771.8)

A conflict of interest is a situation in which a private labor compliance entity performs labor compliance work under contract for both the district and a contractor who is bidding a public works project for the district.  (Labor Code 1771.8)

If the district's private labor compliance entity seeks to respond to an alleged conflict of interest, the Superintendent or designee shall confer with the entity and/or the contractor regarding the applicable contracts and relevant public works law.  (Labor Code 1771.8)

Contracts for Non-Nutritious Foods or Beverages

CSBA NOTE:  Foods and beverages that do not meet nutritional standards specified in law may not be sold in schools except under limited circumstances; see BP/AR 3554 - Other Food Sales for more information regarding food sales outside the district's food service program. Schools that do not participate in the National School Lunch or Breakfast program are required to comply with the nutritional standards in Education Code 49431-49431.7, 5 CCR 15500-15501, and 15575-15578, from one-half hour before the school day to one-half hour after it. Schools that participate in the National School Lunch or Breakfast program are required to comply with the stricter of the nutritional standards in Education Code 49431-49431.7, 7 CFR 210.11, and 220.12, between midnight before and one-half hour after the end of the school day.
The district shall not enter into or renew a contract for the sale of foods or beverages that do not meet applicable nutritional standards specified in Education Code 49431-49431.7, 5 CCR 15500-15501 or 15575-15578, or 7 CFR 210.11 or 220.12, unless the contract specifies that such sale will occur off campus or outside the time restriction specified in applicable law.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35182.5, the district may not enter into a contract that grants exclusive or nonexclusive sales or advertising for carbonated beverages, non-nutritious beverages, or non-nutritious foods unless the Board holds a public hearing and, as mandated, adopts policy that ensures that internal controls are in place to protect the integrity of public funds, that the funds raised will benefit public education, and that the contracts are entered into on a competitive basis.
Before the district enters into or renews a contract that grants exclusive or nonexclusive advertising or sale of carbonated beverages, non-nutritious beverages, or non-nutritious foods as defined in law, the Board shall ensure that the district has sufficient internal controls in place to protect the integrity of public funds and to ensure that funds raised as a result of the contract benefit public education.  (Education Code 35182.5)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35182.5 does not define the term "internal controls." Items #1-2 below are based on suggested "internal controls" as recommended by the Fiscal Crisis Management Assistance Team (FCMAT) and should be modified to reflect the specific internal controls developed by the district.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop the district's internal control procedures to protect the integrity of public funds. Such internal controls may include, but are not limited to, the following:

	Procedures that produce accurate and reliable financial statements and, at the same time, safeguard the assets, financial resources, and integrity of every employee responsible for handling money or property
	
	Control systems shall be systematically evaluated and revised to keep pace with the changing responsibilities of management.
	 
	Procedures to ensure that district personnel do not handle cash or product at the school site
	
	The contract shall specify that the vendor stock the machines and shall provide cash accounting, along with a check, for district proceeds directly to the control office.

CSBA NOTE: Optional Items #1-4 below are not required by law, but present additional factors for the Board to consider to help ensure that the funds raised benefit public education in accordance with Education Code 35182.5. The following list should be modified to reflect district practice.
To ensure that funds raised by the contract benefit district schools and students:

	The Superintendent or designee may invite parents/guardians, students, staff, and interested community members to make recommendations regarding the contract, including recommendations as to how the funds will be spent in a manner that benefits public education
	 
	Prior to ratifying the contract, the Board shall designate the specific programs and activities that will be funded by the proceeds of the contract and consider how the contract reflects the district's vision and goals
	 
	The contract shall specify that the contractor report, on a quarterly basis, to the Superintendent or designee the number of food items or beverages sold within the district and the amount of money raised by the sales
	
	The Superintendent or designee shall report these amounts to the Board on a regular basis.
	 
	The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the contract does not limit the ability of student and parent organizations to plan and operate fundraising activities

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35182.5 mandates the Board to adopt policy to ensure that the contract is entered into on a competitive basis pursuant to Public Contract Code 20111 or through the issuance of a Request for Proposal. Public Contract Code 20111 requires districts to seek competitive bids through advertisements for contracts or services exceeding an amount specified in law. For a detailed procedure for the bidding of contracts, see AR 3311 - Bids.
Any contract for the sale or advertisement of non-nutritious foods or carbonated or non-nutritious beverages shall be entered into on a competitive bid basis pursuant to Public Contract Code 20111 or through the issuance of a Request for Proposal.  (Education Code 35182.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35182.5, the public hearing required before the district may enter into or renew a contract for non-nutritious foods or carbonated or non-nutritious beverages may be met through an annual public hearing to review and discuss existing and potential contracts for the sale of foods and beverages on campuses, as provided in Option 1 below. Option 2 is available for districts that prefer to hold a public hearing for the making or renewal of each contract involving non-nutritious foods or beverages.
OPTION 1:  (Annual public hearing to review and discuss existing and potential contracts)

The Board shall hold an annual public hearing to review and discuss all existing and potential contracts for the sale of foods and beverages on campus, including those sold as full meals or through competitive sales, fundraisers, or vending machines. The Board shall hold a public meeting for any contract not discussed at the annual public hearing.  (Education Code 35182.5)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Public hearing for the making or renewal of each contract)

The Board shall not enter into or renew any contract that grants exclusive or nonexclusive advertising or sale of carbonated beverages, non-nutritious beverages, on non-nutritious foods until parents/guardians, students, and members of the public have had an opportunity to comment on the contract at a public hearing held during a regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Board shall clearly, and in a manner recognizable to the general public, identify in the agenda the contract to be discussed at the meeting.  (Education Code 35182.5)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is applicable to both Options 1 and 2.
The public hearing shall include, but not be limited to, a discussion of the nutritional value of foods and beverages sold within the district; the availability of fresh fruit, vegetables, and grains in school meals and snacks, including locally grown and organic produce; the amount of fat, sugar, and additives in the foods and beverages discussed; and barriers to student participation in school breakfast and lunch programs.  (Education Code 35182.5)

The contract shall be a public record and shall be accessible to the public. The district may not include a confidentiality clause that would prevent the district or a district school from making any part of the contract public and may not enforce any such clause included by a contracting party.  (Education Code 35182.5; Government Code 7928.801)

Contracts for Electronic Products or Services

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35182.5 prohibits districts or schools from entering into contracts for electronic products or services that require dissemination of advertising to students, unless the following conditions are satisfied. This section should be modified to reflect any additional requirements included by the Board.
The Board shall not enter into a contract for electronic products or services that requires the dissemination of advertising to students, unless the Board:  (Education Code 35182.5)

	Enters into the contract at a noticed public hearing of the Board
	 
	Makes a finding that the electronic product or service is or would be an integral component of the education of students
	 
	Makes a finding that the district cannot afford to provide the electronic product or service unless it contracts to permit dissemination of advertising to students
	 
	As part of the district's normal, ongoing communication to parents/guardians, provides written notice that the advertising will be used in the classroom or other learning centers
	 
	Offers parents/guardians the opportunity to request in writing that the student not be exposed to the program that contains the advertising
	
	A request shall be honored for the school year in which it is submitted, or longer if specified, but may be withdrawn by the parents/guardians at any time.

Contracts for Digital Storage and Maintenance of Student Records

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49073.1, the Board is mandated to adopt policy when the district chooses to enter into a contract with a third party to provide services specified in the following section.
The district may enter into or renew a contract with a third party for the purpose of providing services, including cloud-based services, for the digital storage, management, and retrieval of student records and/or to provide digital educational software that authorizes a third-party provider of digital educational software to access, store, and use student records. For these purposes, student records include any information maintained by the district that is directly related to a student and any information acquired directly from the student through the use of instructional software or applications assigned to the student by a teacher or other district employee, and do not include de-identified information.  (Education Code 49073.1)

Any such contract shall contain all of the following:  (Education Code 49073.1)

	A statement that student records continue to be the property of and under the control of the district
	 
	If applicable, a description of the means by which students may retain possession and control of their own student-generated content, as defined in Education Code 49073.1, including options by which a student may transfer student-generated content to a personal account
	 
	A prohibition against the third party using any information in the student record for any purpose other than those required or specifically permitted by the contract
	 
	A description of the procedures by which a parent/guardian or a student age 18 years or older may review personally identifiable information in the student's records and correct erroneous information
	 
	A description of the actions the third party will take, including the designation and training of responsible individuals, to ensure the security and confidentiality of student records
	 
	A description of the procedures for notifying the affected parent/guardian, or the affected student if age 18 years or older, in the event of an unauthorized disclosure of the student's records
	 
	A certification that a student's records shall not be retained or available to the third party upon completion of the terms of the contract and a description of how that certification will be enforced, except that these requirements shall not apply to student-generated content if the student chooses to establish or maintain an account with the third party for the purpose of storing that content
	 
	A description of how the district and the third party will jointly ensure compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 USC 1232g
	 
	A prohibition against the third party using personally identifiable information in student records to engage in targeted advertising

Contracts for Personal Services

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is applicable when the district chooses to contract for personal services that are currently or customarily performed by its classified employees. Pursuant to Education Code 45103.1, such a contract may be entered into or renewed by the district in order to achieve cost savings, but only if the contract (1) is awarded through a publicized, competitive bidding process, (2) does not result in displacement of district employees (layoff, demotion, involuntary transfer to a new classification, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, or time base reductions), and (3) meets other specified conditions.
In order to achieve cost savings, the district may enter into or renew a contract for any personal service that is currently or customarily performed by classified employees if the contract does not displace district employees and meets other conditions specified in Education Code 45103.1. To enter into or renew such a contract, the Board shall ensure that the district meets the conditions specified in Education Code 45103.1.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 45103.1 permits personal service contracts that do not meet the conditions specified in the above paragraph so long as the circumstances listed below exist.
In addition, the district may enter into or renew any contract for personal service without meeting the conditions described above, if any of the following conditions exist:  (Education Code 45103.1)

	The contract is for new district functions and the Legislature has specifically mandated or authorized the performance of the work by independent contractors
	 
	The services contracted are not available within the district, cannot be performed satisfactorily by district employees, or are of such a highly specialized or technical nature that the necessary expert knowledge, experience, and ability are not available through the district
	 
	The services are incidental to a contract for the purchase or lease of real or personal property, including, but not be limited to, agreements to service or maintain office equipment or computers that are leased or rented
	 
	The district's policy, administrative, or legal goals and purposes cannot be accomplished through the utilization of persons selected pursuant to the regular or ordinary district hiring process
	 
	The nature of the work is such that the criteria for emergency appointments, as defined in Education Code 45103.1, apply
	 
	The contractor will provide equipment, materials, facilities, or support services that could not feasibly be provided by the district in the location where the services are to be performed
	 
	The services are of such an urgent, temporary, or occasional nature that the delay that would result from using the district's regular or ordinary hiring process would frustrate their very purpose
