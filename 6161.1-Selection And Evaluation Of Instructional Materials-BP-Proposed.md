## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires that District instructional materials, as a whole, present a broad spectrum of knowledge and viewpoints, accurately reflect and value society's diversity, stimulate thought, the exploration of ideas and intellectual exchanges, and enhance instructors' ability to educate all students through the use of multiple teaching strategies and technologies. The Board shall adopt instructional materials based on a determination that such materials are an effective learning resource to help students achieve grade-level competency and that the materials meet criteria specified in law. Textbooks, technology-based materials, and other educational materials shall be aligned with academic content standards and the District's curriculum to ensure that they effectively support the District's adopted courses of study.

The Board shall select instructional materials for use in grades K-8 that have been approved by the State Board of Education (SBE) or that have, during the District's review process, been determined to be aligned with the state academic content standards adopted by SBE, which includes instructional materials for mathematics and English language arts that are aligned to Common Core State Standards.  (Education Code 60200, 60210)

The Board shall adopt instructional materials for grades 9-12 upon determining that the materials meet the criteria specified in law and the accompanying administrative regulation.  (Education Code 60400)

In selecting or adopting instructional materials, the Board shall consider the recommendation of the Superintendent or designee and/or an advisory committee established to review the materials.

The degree to which every student has sufficient access to standards-aligned instructional materials shall be included in the District's local control and accountability plan.  (Education Code 52060)

Sufficiency of Instructional Materials and Public Hearing

The Board shall annually conduct one or more public hearings on the sufficiency of the District's instructional materials, including textbooks, technology-based materials, other educational materials, and tests. Technology-based materials include, but are not limited to, software programs, video disks, compact disks, optical disks, video and audio tapes, lesson plans, databases, and the electronic equipment required to make use of those materials by students and teachers as a learning resource.  (Education Code 60010, 60119)

The hearing shall be held on or before the end of the eighth week from the first day students attend school for that year.  (Education Code 60119)

The Board encourages participation by parents/guardians, teachers, interested community members, and bargaining unit leaders at the hearing. Ten days prior to the hearing, the Superintendent or designee shall post a notice in three public places within the District containing the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. The hearing shall not take place during or immediately following school hours.  (Education Code 60119)

At the hearing(s), the Board shall determine, through a resolution, whether each student in each school, including each English learner, has sufficient textbooks and/or other instructional materials that are aligned to the content standards adopted by SBE and consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by SBE in each of the following subjects:  (Education Code 60119)

	Mathematics
	 
	Science
	 
	History-social science
	 
	English language arts, including the English language development component of an adopted program
	 
	World language
	 
	Health

The Board shall also determine the availability of science laboratory equipment, as applicable to science laboratory courses offered in grades 9-12.  (Education Code 60119)

In making these determinations, the Board shall consider whether each student has sufficient textbooks or other instructional materials to use in class and to take home. This does not require that each student have two sets of materials. However, materials shall not be considered sufficient if they are photocopied sheets from only a portion of a textbook or instructional materials copied to address a shortage.  (Education Code 60119)

If materials are in a digital format, they shall be considered sufficient as long as each student, at a minimum, has and can access the same materials in the class and to take home as all other students in the same class or course in the District, and has the ability to use and access them at home.  (Education Code 60119)

If the Board determines that there are insufficient textbooks or other instructional materials, the Board shall, by resolution, provide information to classroom teachers and to the public setting forth, for each school in which an insufficiency exists, the percentage of students who lack sufficient standards-aligned textbooks or instructional materials in each subject area and the reasons that each student does not have sufficient textbooks and/or instructional materials. The Board shall submit a copy of the resolution to the County Superintendent of Schools no later than three business days after the hearing. The Board shall take any action to ensure that each student has sufficient materials within two months of the beginning of the school year in which the determination is made.  (Education Code 60119)

In addition, if the County Superintendent, in accordance with Education Code 1240, makes the District aware of a school that does not have sufficient textbooks or instructional materials, the District shall take any action to ensure that each student has sufficient materials within two months of the beginning of the school year.

Prohibition Against Refusal to Approve or Prohibit the Use of Specified Instructional Materials

The use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library shall not be rejected or prohibited by the Board or District on the basis that it includes a study of the role and contributions of any individual or group consistent with the requirements of Education Code 51204.5 and 60040, unless such study would violate Education Code 51501 or 60044.  (Education Code 243)

Complaints

Complaints concerning instructional materials shall be handled in accordance with Board Policy 1312.2 - Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials, Board Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, or Administrative Regulation 1312.4 - Williams Uniform Complaint Procedures, as applicable.
