However, a committee member may be liable for injury caused by the member's own wrongful conduct.
Committee Charge

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-9 may be modified to reflect district practice.
When committees are appointed, committee members shall receive written information which includes, but is not limited to:

	The committee members' names
	 
	The procedure to be used in the selection of the committee chairperson and other committee officers
	 
	The name(s) and contact information of staff member(s) assigned to support the work of the committee
	 
	The goals and specific charge(s) of the committee, including its topic(s) for study
	 
	The specific period of time that the committee is expected to serve
	 
	Legal requirements regarding meeting conduct and public notifications

Committees Subject to Brown Act Requirements

CSBA NOTE: Generally, any commission, committee, board, or other body created by formal action of the Governing Board, regardless of whether that body is permanent or temporary, decision-making or advisory, is a "legislative body," as defined in Government Code 54952, and is required to comply with the open meeting laws (Brown Act). However, some committees are by law exempted from the Brown Act. For example, committees specified in Education Code 35147 are not subject to the Brown Act; see "Committees Not Subject to Brown Act Requirements" below. Committees composed solely of Board members who are less than a quorum of the Board may also be exempt from Brown Act requirements in limited circumstances; see BB 9130 - Board Committees.Committees listed in Items #1- 4 below are generally created by formal Board action and thus are subject to the Brown Act. This list should be modified to add any other specific committees in the district created by formal Board action or any committees that the Board has required to follow the Brown Act. This list should be modified to delete any of the committees that were not created by formal Board action (e.g., Superintendent committees) or do not exist within the district. In Frazer v. Dixon Unified School District, the court held that the adoption of a Board policy that required the appointment of a committee to advise the Superintendent, and in turn, the Board, was a committee created by "formal Board action" within the meaning of Government Code 54952. Therefore, the committee's meetings were subject to the Brown Act. Districts should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel when questions arise regarding the applicability of Brown Act requirements to district or school committees.
Brown Act requirements pertaining to open meetings, notices, and public participation pursuant to Government Code 54950-54963 shall be complied with by any committee created by formal action of the Governing Board, including, but not limited to, the following:

	Advisory committee established pursuant to Education Code 8070 related to career technical education
	 
	Committee established to assist in development of a student wellness policy pursuant to 42 USC 1758b
	 
	Committee established pursuant to Education Code 17387-17391 related to the use or disposition of excess real property
	 
	Citizens' oversight committee established to examine the expenditure of general obligation bond or school facilities improvement bond revenues passed with a 55 percent majority of the voters pursuant to Education Code 15278 and 15359.3

Committees Not Subject to Brown Act Requirements

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35147, school site councils and some advisory committees, as specified in Items #1-7 below, are exempt from the Brown Act but must comply with other, less complex procedural requirements (i.e., the "mini" Brown Act). In addition, the Board may require other specific district committees that are not subject to the Brown Act to follow the requirements of the "mini" Brown Act. Such committees should be added to the list below.
The following committees shall comply with procedural meeting requirements established in Education Code 35147:

	Parent advisory committee and English learner parent advisory committee established pursuant to Education Code 52063 to review and comment on the local control and accountability plan
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35147, school site councils are exempt from the Brown Act and are subject to the procedural meeting requirements in Education Code 35147.
	School site councils established pursuant to Education Code 65000-65001 to develop and approve a school plan for student achievement
	 
	District or school advisory committees established pursuant to Education Code 52176 related to programs for English learners
	 
	School advisory committees established pursuant to Education Code 54425(b) related to compensatory education
	 
	Any district advisory committee established pursuant to Education Code 54444.2 related to migrant education programs
	 
	School committees established pursuant to Education Code 11503 related to parent involvement
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35147, as amended by SB 1057 (Ch. 301, Statutes of 2022), special education advisory committees, established pursuant to Education Code 56190-56194, are not required to meet Brown Act requirements pertaining to open meetings, but must comply with "mini" Brown Act requirements described below.
	Advisory committees established pursuant to Education Code 56190-56194 related to special education

CSBA NOTE: The paragraphs which follow describe the "mini" Brown Act Requirements pursuant to Education Code 35147.
Meetings of the above councils or committees shall be open to the public, and any member of the public shall have the opportunity to address the council or committee during the meeting on any item within its subject matter jurisdiction. Notice of the meeting shall be posted at the school site or other appropriate location accessible to the public at least 72 hours before the meeting, specifying the date, time, and location of the meeting and containing an agenda that describes each item of business to be discussed or acted upon.  (Education Code 35147)

The above councils or committees shall not take action on any item of business not listed on the agenda until after all members present vote unanimously finding that there is a need to take immediate action and that this need came to the council's or committee's attention after the agenda was posted. In addition to addressing items on the agenda, members of the council, committee, or public may ask questions or make brief statements that do not have a significant effect on district students or employees or that can be resolved solely by providing information.  (Education Code 35147)

Any council or committee violating the above procedural requirements must, at the demand of any person, reconsider the item at the next meeting, after allowing for public input on the item.  (Education Code 35147)

Any materials provided to a council or committee shall be made available to any member of the public upon request pursuant to the California Public Records Act, Government Code 7920.00-7930.215.  (Education Code 35147)

Committees Created by Superintendent

Committees created by the Superintendent or designee that do not report to the Board and are not specified in Education Code 35147, shall not be subject to the requirements of the Brown Act or Education Code 35147.
