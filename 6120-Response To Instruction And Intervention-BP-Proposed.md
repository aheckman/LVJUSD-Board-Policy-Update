## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to improve learning and behavioral outcomes for all students by providing a high-quality, data-driven educational program that meets the learning and behavioral needs of each student and reduces disparities in achievement among subgroups of students.  Students who are not making academic progress pursuant to District measures of performance and/or are struggling behaviorally shall receive intensive instruction and intervention supports designed to meet individual learning needs, with progress monitored.

The Superintendent or designee shall convene a team that may include, as appropriate, staff with knowledge of curriculum and instruction, student services, special education, and instructional and behavioral support, certificated personnel, other District staff, and parents/guardians to assist in designing the District's Response to Instruction and Intervention (RtI2) system, based on an examination of indicators of District and schoolwide student achievement and social-emotional well-being.

The District's RtI2 system shall include instructional strategies and interventions with demonstrated effectiveness and be aligned with the District curriculum and assessments. The Superintendent or designee may conduct ongoing screening to determine student needs, analyze data, identify interventions for students not making adequate academic progress, monitor the effectiveness of the interventions, and adjust interventions according to efficacy.

The District's RtI2 system shall include research-based, standards-based, culturally relevant instruction for students in the general education program; universal screening and continuous classroom monitoring to determine students' needs and to identify those students who are not making progress; criteria for determining the types and levels of interventions to be provided; and subsequent monitoring of student progress to determine the effectiveness of the intervention and to make changes as needed.

Additionally, the District's RtI2 system shall provide for:


	High-quality classroom instruction
	 
	High expectations
	 
	Assessments and data collection
	 
	Problem-solving systems approach
	 
	Research-based interventions
	 
	Positive behavioral support
	 
	Fidelity of program implementation
	 
	Staff development and collaboration, which may include training in the use of assessments, data analysis, research-based instructional practices and strategies and emphasize a collaborative approach of professional learning communities among teachers within and across grade spans
	 
	Parent/guardian and family involvement, including collaboration and engagement
	 
	Consideration of further evaluation utilizing RtI2 data
	
	The RtI2 system may be utilized as one component when considering the referral of a student for evaluation for special education or other services.
