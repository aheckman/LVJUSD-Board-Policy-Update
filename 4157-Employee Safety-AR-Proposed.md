## Policy Content

The Superintendent or designee shall provide safety devices and implement safeguards, methods, and processes that are reasonably necessary for the safety and health of employees in the workplace.  (Labor Code 6401)

If the Department of Industrial Relations Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) prohibits entry into any District workplace or performance of a District operation or process based on a determination that the workplace exposes employees to the risk of an imminent hazard, including a machine, device, apparatus, or equipment that is in a dangerous condition or is dangerously placed, the Superintendent or designee shall post a notice of the hazard provided by Cal/OSHA in a conspicuous place at the work site. This notice shall not be removed except by an authorized representative of Cal/OSHA and only when the workplace, operation, or process is made safe, and the required safeguards, safety appliances, or devices are provided.  (Labor Code 6325)

Injury and Illness Prevention Program

The District's injury and illness prevention program shall cover all District employees and all other workers whom the District controls or directs and directly supervises on the job to the extent that the workers are exposed to hazards specific to their worksite and job assignment. The obligation of contractors or other employers who control or direct and supervise their own employees on the job shall not be affected by the District's injury and illness prevention program.  (Labor Code 6401.7)

	The name/position of the person(s) with authority and responsibility for implementing the program
	 
	A system for ensuring that employees comply with safe and healthful work practices, which may include, but are not limited to:
	 
	
		Recognition of employees who follow safe and healthful work practices
		 
		Training and retraining programs
		 
		Disciplinary actions

		Meetings
		 
		Training programs
		 
		Posting
		 
		Written communications
		 
		A system of anonymous notification by employees about hazards
		 
		A labor/management safety and health committee

		Whenever the District is made aware of a new or previously unrecognized hazard
		 
	
	
	A procedure for investigating occupational injury or illness
	 
	Methods and/or procedures for correcting unsafe or unhealthful conditions, work practices, and work procedures in a timely manner, based on the severity of the hazard, when the hazard is observed or discovered
	
	When an imminent hazard exists that cannot be immediately abated without endangering employee(s) and/or property, these procedures shall call for the removal of all exposed staff from the area except those necessary to correct the hazardous condition. Employees needed to correct the condition shall be provided with the necessary safeguards.
	 
	Provision of training and instruction as follows:
	 
	
		To all new employees
		 
		To all employees given new job assignments for which training has not previously been received
		 
		Whenever new substances, processes, procedures, or equipment are introduced into the workplace and represent a new hazard
		 
		Whenever the District is made aware of a new or previously unrecognized hazard
		 
		To supervisors, to familiarize them with the safety and health hazards to which employees under their immediate direction and control may be exposed
		 
	
	
	A written workplace violence prevention plan developed and implemented in accordance with Labor Code 6401.9  (Labor Code 6401.7)
	
	The plan, which shall be easily accessible to all employees at all times, shall be in effect at all times and in all work areas, and be specific to the hazards and corrective measures for each work area and operation.  (Labor Code 6401.9)
	
	The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to all employees when the plan is first established and annually thereafter in accordance with Labor Code 6401.9. Training materials shall be appropriate in content and vocabulary to employees' educational level, literacy, and language.  (Labor Code 6401.9)

The Superintendent or designee shall provide employees, or their representative designated pursuant to 8 CCR 3203, with either of the following:  (8 CCR 3203)


	Access to the District's injury and illness prevention program in a reasonable time, place, and manner, but in no event later than five business days after the request for access is received from an employee or a designated representative of the employee.
	
	When an employee or designated representative requests a copy of the District's injury and illness prevention program, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the requester a printed copy unless the employee or designated representative agrees to receive an electronic copy.
	
	The Superintendent or designee shall provide one printed copy free of charge. If the employee or designated representative requests additional copies within one year of the previous request and the District's injury and illness prevention program has not been updated with new information since the prior copy was provided, the District may charge reasonable reproduction costs pursuant to 8 CCR 3204 for the additional copies.
	 
	Unobstructed access to the District's injury and illness prevention program through the District's server or website that allows an employee to review, print, and email the current version of the District's injury and illness prevention program.

The Superintendent or designee shall communicate the right and procedure to access the District's injury and illness prevention program to all employees.  (8 CCR 3203)

	Review results of the periodic, scheduled worksite inspections.
	 
	Review investigations of occupational accidents and causes of incidents resulting in occupational injury or illness or exposure to hazardous substances. As appropriate, the committee may submit suggestions to the Superintendent or designee regarding the prevention of future incidents.
	 
	Review investigations of alleged hazardous conditions brought to the attention of any committee member. When determined necessary by the committee, it may conduct its own inspection and investigation to assist in remedial solutions.
	 
	Submit recommendations to assist in the evaluation of employee safety suggestions.
	 
	Upon request of Cal/OSHA, verify abatement action taken by the District to abate citations issued by Cal/OSHA.

To avoid unnecessary delay in medical treatment in the event of an employee's serious injury or illness, the Superintendent or designee shall use one or more of the following:  (8 CCR 3400)

	A communication system for contacting a physician or emergency medical service, such as access to 911 or equivalent telephone system. The communication system or the employees using the system shall have the ability to direct emergency services to the location of the injured or ill employee.
	 
	Readily accessible and available on-site treatment facilities suitable for treatment of reasonably anticipated injury and illness
	 
	Proper equipment for prompt medical transport when transportation of injured or ill employees is necessary and appropriate

Protection from Communicable Diseases and Infections

The Superintendent or designee shall develop an exposure control plan for bloodborne pathogens that is consistent with the District's injury and illness prevention program. The plan shall include a determination of which job classifications have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials; precautions to be implemented, including universal precautions, engineering and work practice controls, and personal protective equipment; availability of the hepatitis B vaccination; provision of information and training to employees; and follow-up actions to be taken if exposure occurs. The District shall ensure that a copy of the exposure control plan is accessible to employees in accordance with law.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)
