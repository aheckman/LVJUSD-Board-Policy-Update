## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires that all District schools provide a high-quality educational program that maximizes the achievement of each District student. The District shall provide assistance to schools to support the continuous improvement of student performance within the priorities identified in the District's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) and to enhance the achievement of low-performing student subgroups.

At its discretion, the Board may submit a request to the County Superintendent of Schools for technical assistance regarding the following:  (Education Code 52071)

	Identifying the District's strengths and weaknesses in regard to state priorities addressed in the LCAP, including collaboration between the District and County Superintendent to review performance data on the state and local indicators included in the California School Dashboard, educator qualifications data, and other relevant local data and to identify effective, evidence-based programs or practices that address any areas of weakness
	 
	Identifying student subgroups that are low performing or experiencing significant disparities from other subgroups as identified on the California School Dashboard in order to identify and implement effective programs and practices to improve the outcomes and opportunities for these students
	 
	Securing assistance from an academic, programmatic, or fiscal expert, or team of experts, to identify and implement effective programs and practices that are designed to improve performance in any areas of weakness identified by the District
	 
	Identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses in the identified goals, actions, and services addressed in the LCAP, with a particular focus on those areas considered to be contributing toward meeting the increased or improved services requirement and all required goals
	 
	Reviewing the District's data management policies and collection and submission processes, including monitoring and oversight of the student information system, to ensure the submission of accurate data according to the processes and timelines established by the California Department of Education (CDE)

In the event that the County Superintendent requires the District to receive technical assistance based on a determination that one or more numerically significant student subgroups in a District school meet the performance criteria established pursuant Education Code 52064.5, the District shall, for a minimum of two years, maintain regular communication with, and provide timely documentation to, the County Superintendent regarding the District's completion of the activities listed in Items #1-5 above, or substantially similar activities.  (Education Code 52071)

The District may, at its own expense, engage another service provider, including, but not limited to, another school District, the county office of education, or a charter school, to act as a partner to the District in filling the District's need for technical assistance.  (Education Code 52071)

The District shall consider any recommendations from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence in order to accomplish the goals set forth in the District's LCAP.  (Education Code 52071, 52072, 52074)

If the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) identifies the District as needing intervention, the District shall cooperate with any action taken by the SPI or any academic advisor appointed by the SPI, which may include one or more of the following:  (Education Code 52072.1)

	Revision of the District's LCAP
	 
	Revision of the District's budget, in conjunction with changes in the LCAP, that would allow the District to improve the outcomes for all student subgroups in regard to state and local priorities
	 
	A determination to stay or rescind any District action that would prevent the District from improving outcomes for all student subgroups, provided that action is not required by a collective bargaining agreement

In addition, any school identified by CDE for comprehensive support and improvement, targeted support and improvement, or additional targeted support and improvement shall develop and implement a school plan in accordance with 20 USC 6311. Such schools may be required to partner with an external entity, agency, or individual with demonstrated expertise and capacity to identify and implement more rigorous interventions.
