ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT AND RELEASE OF DISTRICT FROM LIABILITY (STUDENTS)

CSBA NOTE: The following Exhibit presents a sample Acceptable Use Agreement outlining obligations and responsibilities of students using the district's technological resources. The district is encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel in the development of such an agreement. Districts using an Acceptable Use Agreement should require all students and their parents/guardians to sign the agreement as an acknowledgment that they have read and understood its contents and Board Policy 6164.4 - Student Use of Technology.For a sample Acceptable Use Agreement for employees, see E(1) 4040 - Employee Use of Technology.
The  _____________________________  School District authorizes students to use technology, as defined in Board Policy 6163.4 - Student Use of Technology. The use of district technology is a privilege permitted at the district's discretion and is subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth in applicable board policies, administrative regulations, and this Agreement. The district reserves the right to suspend access at any time, without notice, for any reason.

The district expects all students to use technology responsibly in order to avoid potential problems and liability. The district may place reasonable restrictions on the sites, material, and/or information that students may access through the system.

The district makes no guarantee that the functions or services provided by or through the district will be without defect. In addition, the district is not responsible for financial obligations arising from unauthorized use, or misuse, of the system.

Each student who is authorized to use district technology and the student's parent/guardian shall sign this Agreement, which indicates that the student has read and understands the Agreement and Board Policy 6163.4 - Student Use of Technology.

Student Obligations and Responsibilities

Students are expected to use district technology safely, responsibly, and for educational purposes only, and in accordance with the accompanying board policy and applicable copyright laws. The student in whose name district technology is issued is responsible for its proper use at all times. Students shall not share their assigned online services account information, passwords, or other information used for identification and authorization purposes, and shall use the system only under the account to which they have been assigned.

Students shall not gain unauthorized access to the files or equipment of others, access electronic resources by using another person's name or electronic identification, or send anonymous electronic communications. Furthermore, students shall not attempt to access any data, documents, emails, or programs in the district's system for which they do not have authorization.

Students are prohibited from using district technology for improper purposes, including, but not limited to, use of district technology to:

	Access, post, display, create, or otherwise use material that is discriminatory, libelous, defamatory, obscene, sexually explicit, or disruptive
	 
	Bully, harass, intimidate, or threaten other students, staff, or other individuals ("cyberbullying")
	 
	Disclose, use, or disseminate personal identification information (such as name, address, email, telephone number, Social Security number, or other personal information) of another student, staff member, or other person with the intent to threaten, intimidate, harass, or ridicule that person
	 
	Share confidential information or personally identifiable information with an open artificial intelligence (AI) system of themselves, another student, staff member, or other person
	 
	Adjust the privacy settings on any technology tool or AI app unless directed to do so by a teacher or staff member
	 
	Violate the direction of teachers or other staff members, age restrictions, or the intended use of the technology
	 
	Infringe on copyright, license, trademark, patent, or other intellectual property rights
	 
	Intentionally disrupt or harm district technology or other district operations (such as destroying district equipment, placing a virus on district computers, adding or removing a computer program without permission from a teacher or other district personnel, changing settings on shared computers)
	 
	Install unauthorized software
	 
	"Hack" into the system to manipulate data of the district or other users
	 
	Engage in or promote any practice that is unethical or violates any law or board policy, administrative regulation, or district practice

Privacy

Since the use of district technology is intended for educational purposes, students shall not have any expectation of privacy in any use of district technology.

The district reserves the right to monitor and record all use of district technology, including, but not limited to, access to the Internet or social media, Internet searches, browsing history, use of AI, communications sent or received from district technology, or other uses. Such monitoring/recording may occur at any time without prior notice for any legal purposes including, but not limited to, record retention and distribution and/or investigation of improper, illegal, or prohibited activity. Students should be aware that, in most instances, their use of district technology (such as web searches and emails) cannot be erased or deleted.

All passwords created for or used on any district technology are the sole property of the district. The creation or use of a password by a student on district technology does not create a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Personally Owned Devices

If a student uses a personally owned device to access district technology, the student shall abide by all applicable board policies, administrative regulations, and this  Agreement. Any such use of a personally owned device may subject the contents of the device and any communications sent or received on the device to disclosure pursuant to a lawful subpoena or public records request.

Reporting

If a student becomes aware of any security problem (including, but not limited to, a cyberattack, phishing, or any compromise of the confidentiality of any login or account information), or misuse of district technology, the student shall immediately report such information to the teacher or other district personnel.

Consequences for Violation

Violations of the law, board policy, or this Agreement may result in revocation of a student's access to district technology and/or discipline, up to and including suspension or expulsion. In addition, violations of the law, board policy, or this Agreement may be reported to law enforcement agencies as appropriate.

Student Acknowledgment

I have received, read, understand, and agree to abide by this Agreement and other applicable laws and district policies and regulations governing the use of district technology. I understand that there is no expectation of privacy when using district technology. I further understand that any violation may result in loss of user privileges, disciplinary action, and/or appropriate legal action.

Parent or Legal Guardian Acknowledgment

If the student is under 18 years of age, a parent/guardian must also read and sign the Agreement.

As the parent/guardian of the above-named student, I have read, understand, and agree that my child shall comply with the terms of the Agreement. By signing this Agreement, I give permission for my child to use district technology and/or to access the school's computer network and the Internet. I understand that, despite the district's best efforts, it is impossible for the school to restrict access to all offensive and controversial materials. I agree to release from liability, indemnify, and hold harmless the school, district, district personnel and the Board against all claims, damages, and costs that may result from my child's use of district technology or the failure of any technology protection measures used by the district. Further, I accept full responsibility for supervision of my child's use of my child's access account if and when such access is not in the school setting.
