## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE:  The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. 
The Governing Board desires to protect the integrity of student assessments in order to obtain accurate and reliable student achievement data and to ensure accountability to the community and state.  Staff and students shall maintain a high level of integrity in the completion and handling of student assessments.

In administering standardized tests, staff shall not engage in any acts that could result in the invalidation of test results, such as:
 

	Providing inappropriate test preparation
	 
	Modifying test administration procedures, except as allowed by law
	 
	Providing inappropriate assistance to students during test administration
	 
	Changing or filling in answers on student answer sheets
	 
	Providing inaccurate data on student header sheets
	 
	Discouraging or excluding certain students from taking the test
	 
	Engaging in any other practice to artificially raise student scores without actually improving underlying student achievement


Appropriate Test Preparation

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 60611 prohibits districts from implementing any program for the sole purpose of test preparation for the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), as provided below. The district may revise the following paragraph to be applicable to other assessments, such as district or national tests. 
The Superintendent or designee, principals, and teachers shall not implement any program for the sole purpose of test preparation of students for the statewide assessment system or a particular test used in the statewide assessment system.  (Education Code 60611)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 60611 clarifies that districts are not prohibited from using materials to familiarize students with item types or the computer-based testing environment used in the CAASPP. The Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium provides a practice and training test site which offers opportunities for administrators, students, and others to become familiar with the online testing environment before taking an actual online assessment.
The primary preparation for assessments shall be high-quality instruction in the content specified in state and district academic standards.  In addition, staff may prepare students for assessments by teaching general test-taking strategies and familiarizing them with item types or the computer-based testing environment used in state assessments.

Investigation and Consequences of Testing Irregularities

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section establishes a process for investigating reports of testing irregularities and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Reports of cheating on assessments shall be submitted to the Superintendent or designee. The Superintendent or designee shall immediately investigate with due diligence any reports of inappropriate test preparation or other testing irregularities.

Students found to have cheated on assessments shall be subject to disciplinary procedures in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulations.

A staff member found to have committed testing irregularities shall be subject to discipline in accordance with law, applicable collective bargaining agreements, Board policy, and administrative regulations.
           
If the Superintendent or designee is made aware of a testing irregularity on state assessments, he/she shall report the irregularity to the California Department of Education.
