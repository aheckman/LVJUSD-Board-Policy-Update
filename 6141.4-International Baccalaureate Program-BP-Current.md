## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that have received authorization from the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) in Geneva, Switzerland to offer one or more International Baccalaureate (IB) programs at the elementary, middle school, and/or high school level and may be revised to reflect district practice. IB courses and examinations are governed and monitored by the IBO. The Primary Years Program is for elementary school age students and is a schoolwide program. The Middle Years Program is a five-year program beginning in grade 6. The IB Diploma and Career-related Programs are for high school students who participate in IB courses and take IB examinations. Such students may receive college credit for those courses when allowed by the postsecondary institution. For additional information about the requirements for all IB programs, see the International Baccalaureate Organization's web site. 
To encourage district students to challenge themselves academically, develop intercultural understanding and respect, and be more competitive when applying for admission to postsecondary institutions, the district shall offer opportunities for students to participate in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. The Superintendent or designee shall provide a challenging, cross-disciplinary curriculum that provides the knowledge, concepts, skills, attitudes, and action that district students need to equip them for successful lives. The district's IB program shall provide structured, purposeful inquiry that engages students in their own learning.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that district students of all ability levels are offered the opportunity to participate in the program if it is available at their school.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that teachers and administrators are engaged in the planning process for the IB program to construct a rigorous and challenging curriculum.  He/she shall coordinate implementation of the IB program with any other advanced learning opportunities offered by the district.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide staff development and support to teachers of IB courses. Such professional development may include, but is not limited to, mentoring for prospective teachers of IB courses, opportunities for teachers to obtain information on the curriculum of specific courses through online workshops, webinars, blended learning and e-learning resources, and opportunities for district staff to share course syllabi and teaching practices.

IB Diploma Program or IB Career-related Program

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for districts that maintain one or more high schools that offer the IB Diploma Program pursuant to Education Code 52920-52922 and/or the IB Career-related Program and may be revised to reflect district practice. The district may also develop an administrative regulation to provide further details about the district's program and the requirements that students must fulfill in order to successfully complete the program. The IB Diploma Program provides high school students with a balanced education, facilitates geographic and cultural mobility, and promotes international understanding through a shared academic experience in a comprehensive and rigorous two-year program. The IB program has recently added the IB Career-related Program for high school students pursuing vocational or career and technical education (CTE). In this two-year program, students take fewer IB courses but still meet other diploma-level requirements and complete a final project related to their vocational or CTE field. 
The district's IB Diploma Program shall offer a comprehensive, rigorous two-year program for students. To earn the IB diploma, students shall:
 

	Complete a specific, intensive, balanced liberal arts course of study
	 
	Pass examinations in six curricular areas, including language and literature, language acquisition, individuals and societies, sciences, mathematics, and the arts
	 
	Demonstrate an understanding of the theory of knowledge through an oral presentation and extended essay on an externally assessed, independent research project
	 
	Demonstrate creativity, action, and service through involvement in a minimum of 150 hours of artistic activities, physical activities, and community service


The district shall offer a two-year, rigorous IB Career-related Program to high school students pursuing vocational or career and technical education (CTE). Students participating in the IB Career-related Program shall take a minimum of two IB courses and meet other diploma-level requirements, including performing community service and completing a final project related to their vocational or CTE field.

As necessary, the Superintendent or designee may adjust the number of courses taken and hours of community service performed by students depending on the IB program in which they are participating.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop support systems to encourage students to participate in IB courses and take IB course examinations. Support systems may include, but are not limited to, resource centers, programs to recognize student accomplishments, and parent involvement through an IB parent organization group. In addition, the Superintendent or designee may explore partnerships with colleges and universities to encourage students to pursue postsecondary education.

To the extent feasible, the district shall reduce the cost of IB examination fees for eligible low-income students. The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians of the availability of funds for this purpose and shall provide information on how students may apply for funding.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional two paragraphs are for use by districts that receive federal funding distributed by the California Department of Education (CDE) pursuant to 20 USC 6534, or choose to use district funds, to assist economically disadvantaged students in paying the cost of IB examination fees. Students eligible for assistance through federal funds are those whose family income does not exceed 185 percent of the federal poverty level. A student who is eligible for the free and reduced-price meal program qualifies for fee assistance. According to the CDE's Frequently Asked Questions, available on its web site, in order to receive funding assistance, districts must annually submit an application to the CDE which includes the number of income-eligible students and the number of tests taken by each income-eligible student. 
The Superintendent or designee shall annually apply to the California Department of Education for federal funds to support the reimbursement of fees for low-income students. In addition, the Superintendent or designee may recommend the use of district funds, when available and appropriate, to provide additional support for the fee assistance program.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060 requires that the district's local control and accountability plan include annual goals, aligned with specified state priorities, to be achieved for all students and for each numerically significant subgroup as defined in Education Code 52052. Pursuant to Education Code 52060, one measure of the state priority of student achievement is the percentage of students who have passed an Advanced Placement examination with a score of 3 or higher. At its discretion, the district's measures of student achievement could also include the percentage of all students and of each numerically significant student subgroup who pass IB examinations. See AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, as amended by AB 104 (Ch. 13, Statutes of 2015), a numerically significant subgroup includes ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and homeless students, when there are at least 30 students in the subgroup (or at least 15 foster youth or homeless students) in the school or district. For schools or districts with 11-99 students, numerically significant student subgroups are defined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction with approval by the State Board of Education. SB 416 (Ch. 538, Statutes of 2015) repealed Education Code 52921 which had required submission of certain program data to the CDE. 
The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board regarding the number of students participating in the IB program and, as applicable, the percentage of participating students who pass the IB examination in each curricular area. Such reports shall include the participation and outcomes of numerically significant student subgroups as defined in Education Code 52052.
