## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional Board policy and accompanying administrative regulation address disruption of school activities by nonstudents and may be revised to reflect district practice. In Reeves v. Rocklin Unified School District, a California Court of Appeal held that school officials have legal authority to control access to a school campus in order to prevent disruption to normal school activities and need not wait until an actual disruption occurs before restricting access to school grounds.For language regarding disturbances by students, see BP/AR 5131.4 - Student Disturbances and BP/AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process. Employees who cause a disruption may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with the district's collective bargaining agreement and/or Board policy; see BP/AR 4118 - Dismissal/Suspension/Disciplinary Action and AR 4218 - Dismissal/ Suspension/Disciplinary Action.
The Governing Board is committed to providing a safe and orderly environment for students, staff, and others on district property or while engaged in school activities.

The Superintendent or designee shall remove any individual who, by his/her presence or action, disrupts or threatens to disrupt normal operations at a school campus or any other district facility, threatens the health or safety of anyone on district property, or causes or threatens to cause damage to district property or to any property on school grounds.

CSBA NOTE: Specific strategies for responding to disruptions may be developed as part of the district's comprehensive school safety plan (see BP/AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan) and/or may be included in the district's emergency and disaster preparedness plan (see BP/AR 3516 - Emergencies and Disaster Preparedness Plan). The U.S. Department of Education's Guide for Developing High-Quality School Emergency Operations Plans recommends that a school emergency plan describe specific courses of action for addressing threats and hazards, including, but not limited to, criminal threats and actions and active shooter situations.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish a plan describing staff responsibilities and actions to be taken when an individual is causing or threatening to cause a disruption. The plan shall address, as appropriate, visitor registration procedures; campus security measures; evacuation procedures; lock-down procedures; possible responses to an active shooter situation; communications within the school and with parents/guardians, law enforcement, and the media in the event of an emergency; and crisis counseling or other assistance for students and staff after a disruption. In developing such a plan, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with law enforcement to create guidelines for law enforcement support and intervention when necessary.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to school staff on how to identify and respond to actions or situations that may constitute a disruption.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48902 requires the principal or designee to notify law enforcement authorities when any student possesses a firearm or explosive or sells or furnishes a firearm at school. In addition, pursuant to 20 USC 7961, as renumbered by P.L. 114-95, districts are mandated to develop a policy to notify law enforcement whenever a student brings a firearm to school. For policy implementing this mandate, see BP 5131.7 - Weapons and Dangerous Instruments.
Any employee who believes that a disruption may occur shall immediately contact the principal. The principal or designee shall notify law enforcement in accordance with Education Code 48902 and 20 USC 7961 and in other situations, as appropriate.
