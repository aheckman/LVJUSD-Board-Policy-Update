## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes the importance of keeping confidential information confidential. Staff shall maintain the confidentiality of information acquired in the course of their employment.  Confidential/privileged information shall be released only to the extent authorized by law. 

Disclosure of Closed Session Information

CSBA NOTE: As added by AB 1945 (Ch. 1119, Statutes of 2002), Government Code 54963 specifies that a person may not disclose confidential information acquired during his/her presence in a closed session.  For prohibition of the disclosure of closed session information by a Board member, see BB 9011- Disclosure of Confidential/Privileged Information.
An employee shall not disclose confidential information acquired by being present during a closed session to a person not entitled to receive such information, unless the Board authorizes disclosure of that information.  (Government Code 54963)

Confidential information means a communication made in a closed session that is specifically related to the basis for the Board to meet lawfully in closed session. (Government Code 54963)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54963, as added by AB 1945 (Ch. 1119, Statutes of 2002), provides that an employee who willfully discloses confidential information may be subject to disciplinary action. However, in order for the Board to impose discipline, Government Code 54963 requires that the employee have received training about this law or otherwise been given notice of its requirements.  As is the case with any other person who violates this section, the employee may also be subject to injunctive relief in a court of law (e.g., injunction or restraining order) or referral to a grand jury.
An employee who willfully discloses confidential information acquired during a closed session may be subject to disciplinary action if he/she has received training or notice as to the requirements of this policy.  (Government Code 54963)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph specifies one method to help ensure that employees who attend closed sessions receive notice of the law's requirements.  This paragraph should be modified to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide all employees who attend closed sessions a copy of this policy.  New employees who may attend closed sessions shall also receive a copy of this policy.  
CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54963, as added by AB 1945 (Ch. 1119, Statutes of 2002), states that the district may not take disciplinary action against an employee for releasing information if the disclosure was part of an investigation by a grand jury or the district attorney's office, part of a whistleblower action, or merely an opinion as to the legality of a Board action, as specified below.

The district shall not take disciplinary action against any employee for disclosing confidential information acquired in a closed session, nor shall the disclosure be considered a violation of the law or Board policy, when the employee is:  (Government Code 54963)

	Making a confidential inquiry or complaint to a district attorney or grand jury concerning a perceived violation of law, including disclosing facts necessary to establish the illegality or potential illegality of a Board action that has been the subject of deliberation during a closed session
	 
	Expressing an opinion concerning the propriety or legality of Board action in closed session, including disclosure of the nature and extent of the illegal or potentially illegal action
	 
	Disclosing information that is not confidential

Other Disclosures

An employee who willfully releases confidential/privileged information about the district, students or staff shall be subject to disciplinary action.

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 1098 prohibits the disclosure of confidential information for pecuniary or financial gain.  Pursuant to Education Code 35160, the Board may prohibit the disclosure of confidential information even if the release is not for pecuniary gain.  The following paragraph may be modified to reflect district practice.
No employee shall disclose confidential information acquired in the course of his/her official duties.  Confidential information includes information that is not a public record subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act, information that by law may not be disclosed, or information that may have a material financial effect on the employee. 

Any action by an employee which inadvertently or carelessly results in release of confidential/privileged information shall be recorded, and the record shall be placed in the employee's personnel file.  Depending on the circumstances, the Superintendent or designee may deny the employee further access to any privileged information and shall take any steps necessary to prevent any further unauthorized release of such information.
