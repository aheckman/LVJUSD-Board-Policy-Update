## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: As part of the Williams litigation settlement, Education Code 17070.75 requires that each school district participating in the state's School Facility Program have a facility inspection system in place for all schools to ensure that school facilities are kept in good repair. Education Code 17002 defines "good repair" to mean that the facility is maintained in a manner that ensures that it is clean, safe, and functional as determined pursuant to the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the Office of Public School Construction or a local evaluation instrument that uses the same criteria.
The Superintendent or designee shall inspect school facilities to ensure that they are maintained in good repair. At a minimum, the Superintendent or designee shall assess those facility conditions specified on the facilities inspection tool developed by the Office of Public School Construction, including, but not limited to, the following:  (Education Code 17002, 35292.5)

	Gas Leaks: Gas systems and pipes appear and smell safe, functional, and free of leaks
	 
	Mechanical Systems: Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, as applicable, are functional and unobstructed; appear to supply an adequate amount of air to all classrooms, work spaces, and facilities; and maintain interior temperatures within normally acceptable ranges
	 
	Windows and Doors: Windows and doors are intact, functional, and open, close, and lock as designed, unless there is a valid reason they should not function as designed
	 
	Fences and Gates: Fences and gates are intact, functional, and free of holes and other conditions that could present a safety hazard to students, staff, or others
	
	Locks and other security hardware function as designed.
	 
	Interior Surfaces: Walls, floors, and ceilings are free of safety hazards from tears, holes, missing floor and ceiling tiles, torn carpet, water damage, or other cause
	
	Ceiling tiles are intact. Surfaces display no evidence of mold or mildew.
	 
	Hazardous Materials: Hazardous and flammable materials are stored properly
	
	No evidence of peeling, chipping, or cracking paint is apparent. No indicators of mold, mildew, or asbestos exposure are evident. There does not appear to be evidence of hazardous materials that may pose a threat to the health and safety of students or staff.
	 
	Structures: Posts, beams, supports for portable classrooms and ramps, and other structures appear intact, secure, and functional as designed
	
	Ceilings and floors are not sloping or sagging beyond their intended design. There is no visible evidence of severe cracks, dry rot, mold, or damage that undermines structural components.
	 
	Fire Safety and Emergency Equipment: Fire sprinklers, fire extinguishers, emergency alarm systems, and all emergency equipment and systems appear to be functioning properly
	
	Fire alarm pull stations are clearly visible. Fire extinguishers are current and placed in all required areas, including every classroom and assembly area. Emergency exits are clearly marked and unobstructed.
	 
	Electrical Systems: Electrical systems, components, and equipment, including switches, junction boxes, panels, wiring, outlets, and light fixtures, are securely enclosed, properly covered and guarded from student access, and appear to be working properly
	 
	Lighting: Interior and exterior lighting appears to be adequate and working properly
	
	Lights do not flicker, dim, or malfunction, and there is no unusual hum or noise from light fixtures.
	 
	Pest/Vermin Infestation: No visible or odorous indicators of pest or vermin infestation are evident
	 
	Drinking Fountains: Interior and exterior drinking fountains are functional, accessible, and free of leaks
	
	Drinking water pressure is adequate. Fountain water is clear and without unusual taste or odor, and moss, mold, or excessive staining is not evident
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35292.5, as amended by SB 760 (Ch. 227, Statutes of 2023), districts may temporarily close a restroom due to (1) a documented student safety concern, (2) an immediate threat to student safety, or (3) the need to repair the facility.
	Restrooms: Restrooms and restroom fixtures are fully operational, maintained and cleaned regularly, and stocked at all times with supplies, including toilet paper, soap, and paper towels or functional hand dryers, in accordance with Education Code 35292.5
	
	The school keeps all restrooms open during school hours when students are not in classes and keeps a sufficient number of restrooms open during school hours when students are in classes, except when necessary to temporarily close a restroom due to a documented student safety concern, an immediate threat to student safety, or the need to repair the facility.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35292.6, as amended by AB 230 (Ch. 421, Statutes of 2023), the requirement to stock the school's restrooms with free menstrual products for use in connection with the menstrual cycle, and to post a notice as described below, has been expanded to include schools that serve students in grades 3-12. See the accompanying exhibit for a sample notice. The following paragraph should be revised to reflect the grade levels served by the district.


Additionally, any school serving students in any of grades 3-12 shall, at all times, stock and make available and accessible free of cost, an adequate supply of menstrual products in every women's and all-gender restroom, and in at least one men's restroom. The district shall post in a prominent and conspicuous location in every restroom required to stock menstrual products a notice regarding this requirement that includes an email address and telephone number for a designated individual responsible for maintaining the requisite supply of menstrual products.  (Education Code 35292.6

CSBA NOTE: Beginning July 1, 2026, Education Code 35292.5, as amended by SB 760, requires each school to provide and maintain at least one all-gender restroom for student use, as described below. The district is required to ensure that an employee is designated as a point of contact to implement these requirements for each school, and that a notice regarding the requirements be posted in a prominent and conspicuous location outside the all-gender restroom, including contact information for the designated point of contact. The California Department of Education is required to post on its website guidance for implementation of the requirements specified in Education Code 35292.5, including examples of signage and best practices.
In addition, starting July 1, 2026, any school that has more than one female and more than one male restroom designated exclusively for student use shall provide and maintain at least one all-gender restroom for student use. The district shall use signage that identifies the bathroom facility as being open to all genders and is in accordance with 24 CCR 11B-703; ensure that it is available for use consistent with the requirements specified above and is unlocked, unobstructed, easily accessible by any student, and consistent with existing access to sex-segregated restrooms; stock the bathroom facility with menstrual products in accordance with Education Code 35292.6, as specified above; and, ensure that the bathroom facility is available during school hours and school functions when students are present. The district shall post in a prominent and conspicuous location outside at least one all-gender restroom a notice regarding these requirements that includes contact information for the staff member designated as the point of contact responsible for implementing such requirements.


	Sewers: The sanitary sewer system controls odors as designed, displays no signs of stoppage, backup, or flooding in school facilities or on school grounds, and appears to be functioning properly
	 
	Roofs: Roofs, gutters, roof drains, and downspouts appear to be functioning properly and are free of visible damage and evidence of disrepair when observed from the ground from inside and outside the building
	 
	Drainage: School grounds do not exhibit signs of drainage problems, such as visible evidence of flooded areas, eroded soil, water damage to asphalt playgrounds or parking areas, or clogged storm drain inlets
	 
	Playground/School Grounds: Playground equipment, including exterior fixtures, seating, tables, and equipment, and school grounds, fields, walkways, and parking lot surfaces are functional and free of significant cracks, trip hazards, holes, deterioration that affects functionality or safety, and other health and safety hazards
	 
	Overall Cleanliness: School grounds, buildings, common areas, and individual rooms appear to have been cleaned regularly and are free of accumulated refuse and unabated graffiti
	
	Restrooms, drinking fountains, and food preparation or serving areas appear to have been cleaned each day that school is in session.

CSBA NOTE: Although the FIT does not specifically require districts to test for the presence of lead in drinking water, soil, or painted surfaces, such testing is recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency due to the health risks posed by lead exposure, especially for young children. Schools and child care facilities that maintain their own public water systems must test for lead pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 USC 300f-300j-27), and licensed day care centers located in buildings that were constructed before January 1, 2010 are required to test for lead pursuant to Health and Safety Code 1597.16. See AR 3514 - Environmental Safety for further information about lead testing and abatement in schools.
Additionally, to ensure the health and safety of students, the Superintendent or designee shall provide for the testing of drinking water on campus and of the soil and painted surfaces of school facilities for the presence of lead and/or other harmful substances, in accordance with state and federal standards.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any necessary repairs or removal of hazards identified during the inspection are made in a timely and expeditious manner.

An assessment of the safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of school facilities, including any needed maintenance to ensure good repair as defined in Education Code 17002, shall be reported on the school accountability report card.  (Education Code 33126)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35186 provides that the Williams uniform complaint procedures should be used for any complaint alleging a school facility condition that poses an emergency or urgent threat, as defined in Education Code 17592.72, or any complaint that a school restroom is not clean, maintained, or kept open, as defined in Education Code 35292.5; see AR/E(1)/E(2) 1312.4 - Williams Uniform Complaint Procedures.
Any complaint alleging a school facility condition that poses an emergency or urgent threat to the health or safety of students or staff, or alleging that a school restroom is not clean, maintained, stocked, or kept open, shall be addressed in accordance with Administrative Regulation 1312.4 - Williams Uniform Complaint Procedures.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 1240 requires the County Superintendent of Schools to visit low-performing schools to determine (1) the status of any facility condition that may create an emergency or urgent threat to the health or safety of students or staff and (2) the accuracy of data reported on the school accountability report card with respect to the safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of school facilities. Education Code 1240 requires that the County Superintendent provide a quarterly report to the Governing Board on the results of any county office of education (COE) visit. Education Code 1240 provides that, if the County Superintendent determines that a facility condition poses an emergency or urgent threat, or is not in good repair, the County Superintendent may return to the school to verify repairs and/or prepare a report that identifies areas of noncompliance if the district has not provided evidence that the repairs will be made within 30 days or, for major repairs, in a timely manner. The County Superintendent may then present the report to the Board at a public meeting and post the report on the COE's website.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Governing Board with regular reports regarding the district's facility inspections and updates of any visits to district schools by the County Superintendent of Schools to review school facilities.

Schools and child care facilities that maintain their own public water systems must test for lead pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 USC 300f-300j-27), and licensed day care centers located in buildings that were constructed before January 1, 2010 are required to test for lead pursuant to Health and Safety Code 1597.16. See AR 3514 - Environmental Safety for further information about lead testing and abatement in schools.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="YNzgMA4" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22YNzgMA4%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22QNA848%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1726248456%2C%22text%22%3A%22Although%20the%20FIT%20does%20not%20specifically%20require%20districts%20to%20test%20for%20the%20presence%20of%20lead%20in%20drinking%20water%2C%20soil%2C%20or%20painted%20surfaces%2C%20such%20testing%20is%20recommended%20by%20the%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency%20due%20to%20the%20health%20risks%20posed%20by%20lead%20exposure%2C%20especially%20for%20young%20children.%20Schools%20and%20child%20care%20facilities%20that%20maintain%20their%20own%20public%20water%20systems%20must%20test%20for%20lead%20pursuant%20to%20the%20Safe%20Drinking%20Water%20Act%20%2842%20USC%20300f-300j-27%29%2C%20and%20licensed%20day%20care%20centers%20located%20in%20buildings%20that%20were%20constructed%20before%20January%201%2C%202010%20are%20required%20to%20test%20for%20lead%20pursuant%20to%20Health%20and%20Safety%20Code%201597.16.%20See%20AR%203514%20-%20Environmental%20Safety%20for%20further%20information%20about%20lead%20testing%20and%20abatement%20in%20schools.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-YNzgMA4" title="CSBA NOTE: Although the FIT does not specifically ..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

<div id='YMw850' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Education Code 1240 requires the County Superintendent of Schools to visit low-performing schools to determine (1) the status of any facility condition that may create an emergency or urgent threat to the health or safety of students or staff and (2) the accuracy of data reported on the school accountability report card with respect to the safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of school facilities. Education Code 1240 requires that the County Superintendent provide a quarterly report to the Governing Board on the results of any county office of education (COE) visit. Education Code 1240 provides that, if the County Superintendent determines that a facility condition poses an emergency or urgent threat, or is not in good repair, the County Superintendent may return to the school to verify repairs and/or prepare a report that identifies areas of noncompliance if the district has not provided evidence that the repairs will be made within 30 days or, for major repairs, in a timely manner. The County Superintendent may then present the report to the Board at a public meeting and post the report on the COE's website.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="YNzgMA6" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22YNzgMA6%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22YMw850%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1726249622%2C%22text%22%3A%22Education%20Code%201240%20requires%20the%20County%20Superintendent%20of%20Schools%20to%20visit%20low-performing%20schools%20to%20determine%20%281%29%20the%20status%20of%20any%20facility%20condition%20that%20may%20create%20an%20emergency%20or%20urgent%20threat%20to%20the%20health%20or%20safety%20of%20students%20or%20staff%20and%20%282%29%20the%20accuracy%20of%20data%20reported%20on%20the%20school%20accountability%20report%20card%20with%20respect%20to%20the%20safety%2C%20cleanliness%2C%20and%20adequacy%20of%20school%20facilities.%20Education%20Code%201240%20requires%20that%20the%20County%20Superintendent%20provide%20a%20quarterly%20report%20to%20the%20Governing%20Board%20on%20the%20results%20of%20any%20county%20office%20of%20education%20%28COE%29%20visit.%20Education%20Code%201240%20provides%20that%2C%20if%20the%20County%20Superintendent%20determines%20that%20a%20facility%20condition%20poses%20an%20emergency%20or%20urgent%20threat%2C%20or%20is%20not%20in%20good%20repair%2C%20the%20County%20Superintendent%20may%20return%20to%20the%20school%20to%20verify%20repairs%20and/or%20prepare%20a%20report%20that%20identifies%20areas%20of%20noncompliance%20if%20the%20district%20has%20not%20provided%20evidence%20that%20the%20repairs%20will%20be%20made%20within%2030%20days%20or%2C%20for%20major%20repairs%2C%20in%20a%20timely%20manner.%20The%20County%20Superintendent%20may%20then%20present%20the%20report%20to%20the%20Board%20at%20a%20public%20meeting%20and%20post%20the%20report%20on%20the%20COE%27s%20website.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-YNzgMA6" title="CSBA NOTE: Education Code 1240 requires the County..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
