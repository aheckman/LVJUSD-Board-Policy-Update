Patriotic Exercises

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52720 requires all schools to conduct patriotic exercises daily. Pursuant to Education Code 52720 and 52730, this requirement may be satisfied by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and/or through the instruction described below.
Each school shall conduct patriotic exercises daily, which may include the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States and/or instruction that promotes understanding of the concepts of "pledge," "allegiance," "republic," and "indivisible" and understanding of the importance of the pledge as an expression of patriotism, love of country, and pride in the United States.  (Education Code 52720, 52730)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts maintaining elementary schools.
At elementary schools, such exercises shall be conducted at the beginning of each school day. (Education Code 52720)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts maintaining secondary schools. Education Code 52720 mandates that the Board adopt regulations pertaining to the conduct of patriotic exercises in secondary schools. The following paragraph should be revised to reflect district practice.
At secondary schools, such exercises shall be conducted during the homeroom period.

CSBA NOTE: In Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a school policy permitting teacher-led recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance pursuant to Education Code 52720 where students were permitted by policy to decline participation for personal reasons. In West Virginia State Board of Education et al. v. Barnette et al., the court held that individuals may not be compelled to salute the flag or to stand during the salute.
A student may choose not to participate in the flag salute or Pledge of Allegiance for personal reasons.

Display of Flag

At all times, the national flag shall be placed in the position of first honor.  (Government Code 431, 436; 4 USC 6)

When displayed on a building or on a flagstaff in the open, the national flag shall be displayed only from sunrise to sunset unless properly illuminated during the hours of darkness. The flag should not be displayed during inclement weather unless an all-weather flag is used.  (4 USC 6)

The national flag shall fly at half-staff on the following occasions:  (4 USC 7)

	For 30 days from the death of the President or a former President
	 
	For 10 days from the death of the Vice President, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives
	 
	From the day of death until interment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a secretary of an executive or military department, former Vice President, or the Governor of a state
	 
	On the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress
	 
	On Memorial Day, until noon only
	 
	On Peace Officers Memorial Day (May 15), unless it falls on Armed Forces Day
	 
	Upon a proclamation from the Governor in the event of the death of a present or former official of the state government, a member of the Armed Forces from the state who has died while serving on active duty, or the death of a first responder working in the state who dies while serving in the line of duty
