Education Code 35331 requires districts to offer insurance to students participating in an excursion or field trip (see "Field Trips/Excursions" section below).The district is authorized, but not required, to offer medical and/or hospital service or insurance protection to students engaging in other activities, including students who are (1) injured while on school grounds during the school day, at any other place that a school-sponsored activity is being held, or while being transported by the district to and from school, another place of instruction, or a school activity (Education Code 49472); (2) participating in an organized rooting section or being spectators at athletic events (Education Code 32220); (3) participating in occasional play day or field day activities in which students from two or more district schools participate in athletic contests (Education Code 32220); (4) participating in other athletic activities sponsored by, controlled by, or under the jurisdiction of the district (Education Code 49470); (5) enrolled in work experience or vocational education programs at locations off school grounds (Education Code 51760); and/or (6) enrolled in a nursing program or other program in the healing arts offered by the district (Education Code 52530). If the district chooses to offer medical/hospital service or insurance protection for one or more of those purposes, it may expand the following policy accordingly.
The Governing Board believes that all students should have health and accident insurance protection to ensure that they receive needed health care services in the event of illness or injury.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide information to students and their parents/guardians about available insurance against injuries occurring during school-related activities, which may include printed matter furnished by the insurer or membership corporation. Parents/guardians shall not be required to enroll their children in insurance programs offered by the district.
