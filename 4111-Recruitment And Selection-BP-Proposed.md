## Policy Content

The Board of Education is committed to employing suitable, qualified individuals to effectively carry out the District's vision, mission, and goals, and believes that students benefit when District staff reflects the racial, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of the District.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop equitable, fair, and transparent recruitment and selection processes and procedures that ensure individuals are selected for employment in the District based on demonstrated knowledge, skills, and competence and not on any bias, personal preference, or unlawful discrimination.

Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall, through the recruitment and selection processes and procedures, seek to establish and maintain a diverse staff, including the active recruitment from institutions and organizations that serve populations underrepresented among District employees.

When a vacancy occurs, the Superintendent or designee shall review, as appropriate, the job description for the position to ensure that it accurately describes the major functions and duties of the position. The Superintendent or designee shall also disseminate job announcements to ensure a wide range of candidates, in accordance with contract language contained within the current collective bargaining agreement.

When posting an employment opportunity, the Superintendent or designee shall include the pay scale for the open position.  (Labor Code 432.2)

The Superintendent shall develop and maintain appropriate hiring procedures to identify the best possible candidates for a position. In doing so, an interview committee may be established to rank candidates and recommend finalists. During job interviews, applicants may be asked to describe or demonstrate how they will be able to perform the duties of the job. All discussions and recommendations shall be confidential and consistent with law.

No inquiry shall be made about any information prohibited by state or federal nondiscrimination laws.

Unless otherwise provided for in law, the District may not discriminate against a person in hiring based on the person's use of cannabis off the job and away from the workplace, including that the District may not request information from an applicant related to the applicant's prior use of cannabis, apart from the applicant's criminal history, or penalize an applicant based on a drug screening which finds that the applicant has nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolites in the applicant's hair, blood, urine, or other bodily fluid.  (Government Code 12954)

However, the District retains the right to maintain drug-free schools or prohibit employees from possessing, being impaired by, or using cannabis while on the job.  (Government Code 12954)

The Superintendent or designee shall not inquire, orally or in writing, about an applicant's salary history information, including compensation and benefits. Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall not rely on salary history information as a factor in determining whether to offer employment to an applicant or the salary to offer. However, the Superintendent or designee may consider salary information that is disclosable under state or federal law or that the applicant discloses voluntarily and without prompting.  (Labor Code 432.3)

For each position, the Superintendent or designee shall present to the Board one candidate who meets all qualifications established by law and the Board for the position. No person shall be employed by the Board without the recommendation or endorsement of the Superintendent or designee.

Incentives

With Board approval and in accordance with District needs and any applicable collective bargaining agreements, the District may provide incentives to recruit teachers, administrators, or other employees, such as signing bonuses, assistance with beginning teacher induction and/or credential costs, mentoring, additional compensation, and/or subsidized housing.
