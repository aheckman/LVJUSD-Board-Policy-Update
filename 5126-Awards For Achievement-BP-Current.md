## Policy Content

The Governing Board encourages excellence as a goal for all students and wishes to publicly recognize students for exemplary achievement in academic, artistic, extracurricular, athletic, and community service activities.

CSBA NOTE: Generally, state law requires that the educational program be made available to all students, regardless of their socioeconomic background. For example, Education Code 51455 and 51464, prohibit districts from charging students a fee or other cost in relation to any requirements in qualifying for or receiving the Golden State Seal Merit Diploma or the State Seal of Biliteracy. Additionally, Education Code 51007 requires that all students enrolled in the state's public elementary and secondary schools, regardless of their socioeconomic background, have equitable access to educational programs designed to strengthen technological skills. The following paragraph reflects the intent of these laws. For more information regarding the promotion of equity in district programs and activities, see BP 0415 - Equity.
No fee or other cost shall be charged to any student in relation to any requirements in qualifying for or receiving any district achievement awards.

District/School Awards

See the accompanying administrative regulation for language implementing this mandate.Pursuant to Education Code 44015, when such an awards program is established in a district, the Board is required to budget funds for this purpose, but may authorize awards from funds under its control regardless of whether budgeted funds have been provided or the budgeted funds are exhausted.
Student awards may include verbal recognition, a letter, a certificate, a Board resolution, public ceremony, trophy, gift, plaque, or monetary gift. The Board shall establish a budget for this purpose.  (Education Code 44015)

District Awards for Biliteracy

See the accompanying administrative regulation for eligibility criteria for the award.Education Code 51475 established the California Serves program which provides grants to eligible districts with the goal of expanding access for students to obtain a State Seal of Civic Engagement through service learning.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph reflects information on CDE's website emphasizing that the criteria are written to ensure that no student is excluded from the opportunity to earn the State Seal of Civic Engagement based on academic ability, alternative school settings, or unique or unconventional expressions of civic engagement.
All district students shall be afforded the opportunity to earn the State Seal of Civic Engagement, regardless of their background, communities, or experiences. No student shall be denied such opportunity based on academic ability, alternative school setting, or unique or unconventional expression of civic engagement.

Scholarship and Loan Fund

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that choose to establish and maintain a scholarship and loan fund pursuant to Education Code 35310-35319. If the district chooses to establish such a fund, it should revise the following paragraph to reflect only those purposes for which it wishes to make funds available.
The Board shall establish and maintain a scholarship and loan fund which shall be used to provide interest-free loans for educational advancement, scholarship, and/or grants-in-aid to bona fide organizations, students, or graduates of district schools.  (Education Code 35310, 35315)

The district's scholarship and loan fund shall be administered by a district committee composed of Board members, the Superintendent, and such other community, staff, administrative, and/or student representatives as determined by the Board.  (Education Code 35310)

CSBA NOTE: If the district chooses to establish and maintain a scholarship and loan fund, it is mandated pursuant to Education Code 35310 to develop rules and regulations specifying the term of office and method of selection of the community, faculty, administrative, and student representative members of the committee appointed to administer the fund. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Board shall select its own representatives to the committee. Staff, community, and/or student representatives shall be selected by the Superintendent. Members of this committee shall serve two-year terms.

The committee may accept gifts, donations, and bequests made for the purposes of the fund and may prescribe conditions or restrictions on these gifts and bequests. If the donor imposes any conditions, the committee shall review the conditions and make a recommendation to the Board as to the compatibility of such conditions with the intent and purpose of the fund. The Board may prohibit the committee from accepting any donation under conditions it finds incompatible with the fund's intents and purposes as specified in Board Policy 3290 - Gifts, Grants and Requests.  (Education Code 35313)
