Educational Opportunities

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional. Pursuant to Education Code 51745, the list of educational opportunities that may be provided through independent study includes Items #1-5 below, and may be revised or expanded to reflect district practice.
Educational opportunities offered through independent study may include, but are not limited to:  (Education Code 51745)

	Special assignments extending the content of regular courses of instruction
	 
	Individualized study in a particular area of interest or in a subject not currently available in the regular school curriculum
	 
	Continuing and special study during travel
	 
	Volunteer community service activities and leadership opportunities that support and strengthen student achievement
	 
	Individualized study for a student whose health, as determined by the student's parent/guardian, would be put at risk by in-person instruction or for a student who is unable to attend in-person instruction due to a quarantine due to exposure to, or infection with, COVID-19, pursuant to local or state public health guidance

In addition, when requested by a parent/guardian due to an emergency or illness, independent study may be used on a short-term basis to ensure that the student is able to maintain academic progress in the student's regular classes.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts maintaining high schools.
No course required for high school graduation shall be offered exclusively through independent study.  (Education Code 51745)

Equivalency

The district's independent study option shall be substantially equivalent in quality and quantity to classroom instruction to enable participating students to complete the district's adopted course of study within the customary timeframe. Students in independent study shall have access to the same services and resources that are available to other students in the school and shall have equal rights and privileges.  (5 CCR 11700, 11701.5)

Students participating in independent study shall have access to Internet connectivity and devices adequate to participate in the educational program and complete assigned work.  (Education Code 51747)

The district shall not provide independent study students and their parents/guardians with funds or items of value that are not provided for other students and their parents/guardians. Providing access to Internet connectivity and district-owned devices adequate to participate in an independent study program and complete assigned work consistent with Education Code 51747, or to participate in an independent study course, as authorized by Education Code 51749.5, shall not be considered funds or other things of value.  (Education Code 46300.6, 51747.3)

Eligibility for Independent Study

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51748, independent study students must be enrolled in school as a condition of receiving state apportionments.
To participate in independent study, a student shall be enrolled in a district school.  (Education Code 51748)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee may approve the participation of a student who demonstrates the motivation, commitment, organizational skills, and academic skills necessary to work independently provided that experienced certificated staff are available to effectively supervise students in independent study. The Superintendent or designee may also approve the participation of a student whose health would be put at risk by in-person instruction. A student whose academic performance is not at grade level may participate in independent study only if the program is able to provide appropriate support, such as supplemental instruction, tutoring, counseling, ongoing diagnostic assessments, and/or differentiated materials, to enable the student to be successful. For an elementary student, the Superintendent or designee may consider the parent/guardian's level of commitment to assist the student.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph limits eligibility for independent study to those students for whom state apportionments can be claimed. Education Code 46300.2 provides that districts will receive state funding for independent study for students who are residents of the county or an adjacent county. Pursuant to Education Code 51747.3, students whose residency status is based on parent/guardian employment within district boundaries in accordance with Education Code 48204 are not eligible for funds apportioned for average daily attendance (ADA).
A student participating in independent study shall be a resident of the county or an adjacent county. Full-time independent study shall not be available to students whose district residency status is based on their parent/guardian's employment within district boundaries pursuant to Education Code 48204.  (Education Code 46300.2, 51747.3)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51745, a student with disabilities may participate in independent study if the student's individualized education program specifically provides for such participation, as specified below.
A student with disabilities, as defined in Education Code 56026, may participate in independent study if the student's individualized education program (IEP) specifically provides for such participation. If a parent/guardian of a student with disabilities requests independent study because the student's health would be put at risk by in-person instruction, the student's IEP team shall make an individualized determination as to whether the student can receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in an independent study placement. A student's inability to work independently, need for adult support, or need for special education or related services shall not preclude the IEP team from determining that the student can receive FAPE in an independent study placement.  (Education Code 51745)

A temporarily disabled student shall not receive individual instruction pursuant to Education Code 48206.3 through independent study.  (Education Code 51745)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph limits enrollment in independent study to those students for whom state apportionments can be claimed. Pursuant to Education Code 51745, no more than 10 percent of the students enrolled in a continuation high school or opportunity school or program are eligible for apportionment credit for independent study, with the exception of students participating in independent study due to an emergency as described in Education Code 41422 and 46392. A pregnant student or a parenting student who is the primary caregiver for the student's child(ren) is not included in this cap.
Except for students participating in independent study due to an emergency as described in Education Code 41422 and 46392 and pregnant and parenting students who are the primary caregiver for their child(ren), no more than 10 percent of the students enrolled in a continuation high school or opportunity school or program shall be enrolled in independent study.  (Education Code 51745)

Monitoring Student Progress

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice.
The independent study administrator and/or supervising teacher shall promptly and directly address any failure by the student to meet the terms of the student's written agreement. The following supportive strategies may be used:

	A letter to the student and/or parent/guardian
	 
	A meeting between the student and the teacher and/or counselor
	 
	A meeting between the student and the independent study administrator, including the parent/guardian if appropriate
	 
	An increase in the amount of time the student works under direct supervision

When the student has failed to make satisfactory educational progress or missed the number of assignments specified in the written agreement as requiring an evaluation, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct an evaluation to determine whether independent study is in the student's best interest. This evaluation may result in termination of the independent study agreement and the student's return to the regular classroom program or other alternative program.  (Education Code 51747, 51749.5; 5 CCR 11701)

A written record of the findings of any such evaluation shall be treated as a mandatory interim student record which shall be maintained for three years from the date of the evaluation, and if the student transfers to another public school in California, the record shall be forwarded to that school.  (Education Code 51747, 51749.5)

Responsibilities of Independent Study Administrator

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice.
The responsibilities of the independent study administrator include, but are not limited to:

	1.    Recommending certificated staff to be assigned as independent study teachers at the required teacher-student ratios pursuant to Education Code 51745.6 and supervising staff assigned to independent study functions who are not regularly supervised by another administrator
	2.    Approving or denying the participation of students requesting independent study
	3.    Facilitating the completion of written independent study agreements

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51745.6, the equivalency of teacher-student ratios as described below is a necessary condition for the district to receive apportionments for independent study. The district may exceed these ratios, but those additional units of independent study ADA would not be funded.The Education Audit Appeals Panel's, "Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting," includes verification that the district calculated its independent study teacher-student ratio consistent with Education Code 51745.6.
The ratio of student average daily attendance for independent study students age 18 years or younger to full-time equivalent certificated employees responsible for independent study shall not exceed the equivalent ratio for all other education programs in the district, unless a new higher or lower ratio for all other educational programs offered is negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement or the district enters into a memorandum of understanding that indicates an existing collective bargaining agreement contains an alternative ratio.  (Education Code 51745.6)

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The responsibilities of the supervising teacher shall include, but are not limited to:

	Regularly meeting with the student to discuss the student's progress
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51747.5, the district may claim apportionment credit for independent study only to the extent of the time value of student work products as personally judged by a certificated employee of the district, or the combined time value of student work products and participation in synchronous instruction, as long as the synchronous instructional offering augments the time value of the student work product and evidence of student participation is furnished and maintained. Pursuant to Education Code 51747.5, as amended by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), work products may include the daily time value spent by a student engaged in asynchronous instruction, including work completed on an online or computer-based instructional activity, regardless of whether student work products are produced, if the computer program documents student participation. Education Code 51747.5, as amended by AB 176 (Ch. 998, Statutes of 2024), clarifies that the district is required to maintain documentation of hours or fraction of an hour for both student work products and the time that the student engaged in asynchronous instruction. Evidence of student participation may include, but is not limited to, student work produced or performed, or documentation that the student participated in an instructional period either visually or verbally, as verified by a certificated employee and maintained by the district for each hour or fraction of an hour of the synchronous instructional offering. Education Code 51747.5 specifies that the teacher is not required to sign and date the work products.
	Determining the time value of assigned work or work products completed and submitted by the student, including time that the student engaged in asynchronous instruction
	 
	Assessing student work and assigning grades or other approved measures of achievement
