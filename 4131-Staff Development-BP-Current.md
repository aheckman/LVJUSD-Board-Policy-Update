## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Staff development is not one of the enumerated items within the scope of collective bargaining pursuant to Government Code 3543.2.  However, the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) has found that some aspects of staff development may be negotiable if they are related to an enumerated subject of bargaining, such as working hours, wages, or other enumerated terms or conditions of employment; see United Faculty of Contra Costa Community College District v. Contra Costa Community College District.  Because the terms "staff development" and "training" are not always clear, their negotiability, in the absence of an agreement, may be determined by PERB on a case-by-case basis.The following paragraph has been expanded to emphasize the importance of student well-being and related professional development in the area of social-emotional development and learning.  Social-emotional learning is a strategy utilized to improve school climate, which benefits all students including students at higher risk of harassment.  See Items #4 and 7 below regarding diverse student populations and school climate, respectively.
The Governing Board believes that, in order to maximize student learning, achievement, and well-being, certificated staff members must be continuously learning and improving relevant skills.  The Superintendent or designee shall develop a program of ongoing professional development which includes opportunities for teachers to enhance their instructional and classroom management skills, become informed about changes in pedagogy and subject matter, and strengthen practices related to social-emotional development and learning.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060-52077 require districts to develop a local control and accountability plan (LCAP) which includes goals aligned with state and local priorities, specific actions aligned to meet those goals, and a budget aligned to fund those specific actions; see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.  The district's staff development program should be aligned with its priorities and goals as outlined in the LCAP and other applicable district and school plans.
The Superintendent or designee shall involve teachers, site and district administrators, and others, as appropriate, when creating, reviewing, and amending the district's staff development program.  The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's staff development program is aligned with district priorities for student learning, achievement and well-being, school improvement objectives, the local control and accountability plan, and other district and school plans.

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-11 below are optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The district's staff development program shall assist certificated staff in developing knowledge and skills, including, but not limited to:

	Mastery of subject-matter knowledge, including current state and district academic standards
	 
	Use of effective, subject-specific teaching methods, strategies, and skills
	
	CSBA NOTE: The State Board of Education's California Digital Learning Integration and Standards Guidance, adopted pursuant to SB 98 (Ch. 24, Statutes of 2020), provides recommendations for staff development regarding technology-based learning.  It encompasses curriculum and instructional guidance for mathematics, English language arts, and English language development, including a framework for addressing critical standards, formative and diagnostic assessment, recommended aggregate time for instruction and independent work by grade, and guidance on embedding social-emotional supports for students into technology-based learning curriculum.  Although this guidance was written in response to COVID-19, it is intended to be used as a resource for the re-envisioning of education and digital teaching and learning.Education Code 51745-51749.6, as amended by AB 130 (Ch. 44, Statutes of 2021), contain specified requirements for districts offering technology-based instruction pursuant to an independent study program. See BP/AR 6158 - Independent Study.
	Use of technologies to enhance instruction and learning, including face-to-face, remote, or hybrid instruction
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 218, the California Department of Education (CDE) has developed and/or updated resources, available on its web site, for use in schools serving students in grades 7-12 for in-service training for the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) students, and strategies to increase support for LGBTQ students which improve overall school climate. Pursuant to Education Code 218, districts that serve students in grades 7-12 are encouraged to use such resources to provide training at least once every two years to teachers and other certificated staff.
	Sensitivity to and ability to meet the needs of diverse student populations, including, but not limited to, students with characteristics specified in Education Code 200 and/or 220, Government Code 11135, and/or Penal Code 422.55
	 
	Understanding of how academic and career technical instruction can be integrated and implemented to increase student learning
	 
	Knowledge of strategies that encourage parents/guardians to participate fully and effectively in their children's education
	 
	Effective classroom management skills and strategies for establishing a climate that promotes respect, fairness, acceptance, and civility, including conflict resolution, hatred prevention, and positive behavioral interventions and supports
	 
	Ability to relate to students, understand their various stages of growth and development, and motivate them to learn
	 
	Ability to interpret and use data and assessment results to guide instruction
	
	CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph has been expanded to include social-emotional learning and trauma-informed practices.The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning describes social-emotional learning as, "the process through which all young people and adults acquire and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to develop healthy identities, manage emotions and achieve personal and collective goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain supportive relationships, and make responsible and caring decisions."Trauma-informed practices include recognizing and responding appropriately to students who have experienced trauma in order to minimize disruption to learning, academic achievement, and physical and emotional well-being.
	Knowledge of topics related to student mental and physical health, safety, and welfare, which may include social-emotional learning and trauma-informed practices
	 
	Knowledge of topics related to employee health, safety, and security


CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.  Education Code 44277 encourages districts to establish individualized professional growth programs for teachers and other educators based on a needs assessment and to evaluate such programs based on specified criteria.  Districts may assist teachers with preliminary credentials to meet the qualifications required for a professional clear credential, and are required to provide support and guidance to teachers participating in internship programs (Education Code 44325-44328, 44450-44468, and 44830.3) and teachers who possess a short-term staff permit (5 CCR 80021), a provisional internship permit (5 CCR 80021.1), or an emergency permit (Education Code 44300; 5 CCR 80023-80026.6); see AR 4112.2 - Certification and AR 4112.21 - Interns.
The Superintendent or designee shall, in conjunction with teachers, interns, and administrators, as appropriate, develop an individualized program of professional growth to increase competence, performance, and effectiveness in teaching and classroom management and, as necessary, to assist them in meeting state or federal requirements to be fully qualified for their positions.

Professional learning opportunities offered by the district shall be evaluated based on the criteria specified in Education Code 44277.  Such opportunities may be part of a coherent plan that combines school activities within a school, including lesson study or co-teaching, and external learning opportunities that are related to academic subjects taught, provide time to meet and work with other teachers, and support instruction and student learning.  Learning activities may include, but are not limited to, mentoring projects for new teachers, extra support for teachers to improve practice, and collaboration time for teachers to develop new instructional lessons, select or develop common formative assessments, or analyze student data.  (Education Code 44277)

The district's staff evaluation process may be used to recommend additional individualized staff development for individual employees.

The Board may budget funds for actual and reasonable expenses incurred by staff who participate in staff development activities.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide a means for continual evaluation of the benefit of staff development activities to both staff and students and shall regularly report to the Board regarding the effectiveness of the staff development program.  Based on the Superintendent's report, the Board may revise the program as necessary to ensure that the staff development program supports the district's priorities for student achievement and well-being.
