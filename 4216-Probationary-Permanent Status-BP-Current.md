## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 45113 mandates the Governing Board in a non-merit system district to develop rules and regulations for the personnel management of classified employees. For districts establishing the merit system pursuant to Education Code 45240-45320, rules for the efficient running of the classified service are established by the personnel commission pursuant to Education Code 45260. The following policy may be revised to reflect district practice, any applicable collective bargaining agreement, or personnel commission rules.
The Governing Board desires to employ and retain highly qualified classified personnel to support the district's educational program and operations. Newly hired classified employees shall serve a probationary period during which the Board shall determine their suitability for long-term district employment.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph should be revised to reflect the specific length of the probationary period prescribed by the district, provided the probationary period does not exceed the time limits specified below.
A probationary employee who has been employed by the district for six months or 130 days of paid service, whichever is longer, shall be classified as a permanent employee of the district.  (Education Code 45113, 45301)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45113 (non-merit system districts) and 45301 (merit system districts), as amended by AB 486 (Ch. 666, Statutes of 2021), in order to receive permanent classified service status, a full-time district police officer and public safety dispatcher who operates a dispatch center certified by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training must serve in a probationary status for not less than one year from the date of appointment to the full-time position. See AR 3515.3 - District Police/Security Department.
However, in order to receive permanent classified service status, a full-time district police officer or public safety dispatcher who operates a dispatch center certified by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training shall serve in a probationary status for not less than one year from the date of appointment.  (Education Code 45113, 45301)

Probationary employees shall receive written performance evaluations by their supervisor during the probationary period. These evaluations shall indicate whether the evaluator is satisfied or not satisfied with the employee's ability, performance, and compatibility with the job.

The district may, without cause, dismiss a new employee during the probationary period.

Permanent employees promoted to a higher classification shall be considered probationary in their new position until they have satisfactorily completed the probationary period.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45301, as amended by SB 874 (Ch. 150, Statutes of 2022), the paragraph below also applies to districts that have adopted the merit system.
A permanent employee who accepts a promotion and fails to complete the probationary period for that promotional position shall be employed in the classification from which the employee was promoted.  (Education Code 45113, 45301)

This policy shall be made available to classified employees and the public.  (Education Code 45113)
