## Policy Content

In order to provide for the safety of students and staff, the Board of Education authorizes the Superintendent or designee to close a school site, change the regular school day schedule, or take any necessary action when hazardous environmental, health, or weather conditions, or other emergencies, warrant.

When an emergency condition causes a school closure, reduction in attendance, or change in schedule pursuant to Education Code 41422 or 46392, thereby preventing the District from complying with the minimum number of instructional days or minutes required by law, the Superintendent or designee shall complete and submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) the necessary forms and/or affidavits for obtaining approval of apportionment credit for the days of the closure, reduction in attendance, or change in schedule. The Superintendent or designee shall submit other relevant District records as may be required.

For school closures or material decreases in attendance due to emergency events that occur between September 2, 2021 and June 30, 2026, the Superintendent or designee shall certify in the affidavit submitted to the SPI that the District has a plan for offering independent study within 10 instructional days of the school closure to any student impacted by the emergency condition. The plan shall address the establishment, within a reasonable time, of independent study master agreements as specified in Board Policy 6158 - Independent Study, and require reopening in person as soon as possible once allowable under the direction from the city or county health officer.   (Education Code 46393)

For school closures or material decreases in attendance due to emergency events occurring on or after July 1, 2026, the Superintendent or designee shall certify in the affidavit submitted to the SPI that the District's comprehensive safety plan includes an instructional continuity plan, and that the District offered student engagement and instruction consistent with the instructional continuity plan, or that it did not do so due to extenuating circumstances.  (Education Code 46393)

The Superintendent or designee shall establish a system for informing students and parents/guardians with timely notice in advance of any changes to the school day, a school closure, or if school buses are not operating as scheduled. The District's notification system shall include, but is not limited to, notifying local television, streaming services, and/or radio stations; posting on District website(s) and/or social media account(s); sending email and text messages; and/or making telephone calls.

When the District makes any notification to students and/or parents/guardians utilizing an automatic dialing-announcing device, the device shall be operated by a person who shall follow all procedures required by law prior to operating the device, and disconnect the device from the telephone line upon the termination of the call.  (Public Utilities Code 2874)

Whenever the school day schedule changes after students have arrived at school, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that students are supervised in accordance with the procedures specified in Board Policy/Administrative Regulation 3516 - Emergencies and Disaster Preparedness Plan.

The Superintendent or designee may provide a means to make up lost instructional time later during the year.
