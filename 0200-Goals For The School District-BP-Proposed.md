## Policy Content

As part of the Board of Education's responsibility to set direction for the school district, the Board shall adopt long-term goals focused on the achievement of all District students.  The District's goals shall be aligned with the District's vision, mission, philosophy, and priorities.

In developing goals and identifying strategies to achieve those goals, the Board and Superintendent shall solicit input and review from key stakeholders. The Board shall also review and consider quantitative and/or qualitative data, including data disaggregated by student subgroup and school site, to ensure that District goals are aligned with student needs.

Goals shall be established for all students and each numerically significant subgroup as defined in Education Code 52052, which may include ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and homeless students and shall address each of the state priorities identified in Education Code 52060 and any additional local priorities established by the Board.  These goals shall be incorporated into the District's local control and accountability plan (LCAP).  (Education Code 52060-52077)

The LCAP shall include a clear description of each goal, one or more of the state or local priorities addressed by the goal, any student subgroup(s) or school site(s) to which the goal is applicable, and expected progress toward meeting the goal for the term of the LCAP and in each year.

Each year the District's update to the LCAP shall review progress toward the goals and describe any changes to the goals. (Education Code 52060-52061)

In addition to the goals identified in the LCAP, and consistent with those goals, the District and each school site may establish goals for inclusion in another district or school plan or for any other purpose. Such goals may address the improvement of governance, leadership, fiscal integrity, facilities, community involvement and collaboration, student wellness and other conditions of children, and/or any other areas of District or school operations.  As appropriate, each goal shall include benchmarks or short-term objectives that can be used to determine progress toward meeting the goal.
