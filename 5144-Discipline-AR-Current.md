## Policy Content

Site-Level Rules

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional. Pursuant to Education Code 35291.5, schools are authorized, but not required, to adopt site-level student discipline rules and procedures. Schools that choose to adopt student discipline rules, or that are directed by the Governing Board to do so, must solicit input from groups specified in Items #1-5 below. Such site-level rules must be consistent with law, Board policy, and district regulations. If the school develops student discipline rules, Education Code 32282 requires that they be included in the comprehensive safety plan; see BP/AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan.In addition, pursuant to Education Code 52060, the district is required to adopt a local control and accountability plan (LCAP) that includes a description of the specific actions that it intends to take to achieve its annual goals in specified priority areas, including student engagement and school climate. In the development of the LCAP, the district is required to involve and/or consult with parents/guardians, employees, employee organizations, and students in accordance with law. See BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.
Site-level rules shall be consistent with state law and Board policies and administrative regulations. In developing site-level disciplinary rules, the principal or designee shall solicit the participation, views, and advice of one representative selected by each of the following groups:  (Education Code 35291.5)

	Parents/guardians
	 
	Teachers
	 
	School administrators
	 
	School security personnel, if any
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35291.5 references students in junior high and high school, which has been interpreted to mean students in grades 7-12. Item #5 below may be deleted by elementary districts.
	Students in grades seven through twelve

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 35291.5 authorizes, but does not require, each school site to adopt school rules every four years. However, it is recommended that the timelines for the review of school rules be aligned with those for the review and updating of the comprehensive safety plan, since the school rules must, by law, be included in the plan. Pursuant to Education Code 32286, the comprehensive safety plan must be reviewed and updated every year by March 1; see BP/AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan.
Annually, site-level discipline rules shall be reviewed and, if necessary, updated to align with any changes in state law, district discipline policies and regulations, and/or goals for school safety and climate as specified in the district's local control and accountability plan. A copy of the rules shall be filed with the Superintendent or designee for inclusion in the comprehensive safety plan.

School rules shall be communicated to students clearly and in an age-appropriate manner.

It shall be the duty of each employee of the school to enforce the school rules on student discipline.  (Education Code 35291.5)

Disciplinary Strategies

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48900.5 lists means of correction of student behavior that a district may use as an alternative to suspension. The district should select those strategies that are appropriate for its student population. The following strategies may be modified or expanded to reflect district practice.
To the extent possible, staff shall use disciplinary strategies that keep students in school and participating in the instructional program. Except when students' presence causes a danger to themselves or others or they commit a single act of a grave nature or an offense for which suspension or expulsion is required by law, suspension, supervised suspension, or expulsion shall be used only when other means of correction have failed to bring about proper conduct. Disciplinary strategies may include, but are not limited to:

	Discussion or conference between school staff, the student, and the student's parents/guardians
	 
	Referral of the student to the school counselor or other school support service personnel for case management and counseling
	 
	Convening of a study team, guidance team, resource panel, or other intervention-related team to assess the behavior and develop and implement an individual plan to address the behavior in partnership with the student and the student's parents/guardians
	 
	When applicable, referral for a comprehensive psychosocial or psychoeducational assessment, including for purposes of creating an individualized education program (IEP) or a Section 504 plan
	 
	Enrollment in a program for teaching prosocial behavior or anger management
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49414.4, as added by SB 10 (Ch. 856, Statutes of 2023), as part of a restorative justice framework, the district may use alternatives to a referral to a law enforcement agency in response to an incident involving a student's misuse of an opioid, to the extent the alternatives are not in conflict with any other law requiring that referral. Items #6-9 below reflect these alternative approaches.
	Participation in a restorative justice program
	 
	A positive behavior support approach with tiered interventions that occur during the school day on campus
	 
	Participation in a social and emotional learning program that teaches students the ability to understand and manage emotions, develop caring and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relationships, and handle challenging situations capably
	
	CSBA NOTE: The Public Counsel's Fix School Discipline Project recognizes that exposure to chronic violence and other family or community traumas, such as serious accidents and life-threatening illnesses involving loved ones, and to conditions such as homelessness, may affect students' ability to learn and function well in school, and urges schools to adopt policies that recognize those factors and provide appropriate support to students.
	Participation in a program that is sensitive to the traumas experienced by students, focuses on students' behavioral health needs, and addresses those needs in a proactive manner
	 
	After-school programs that address specific behavioral issues or expose students to positive activities and behaviors, including, but not limited to, those operated in collaboration with local parent and community groups
	 
	Detention after school hours as provided in the section below entitled "Detention After School"
	 
	Community service as provided in the section below entitled "Community Service"
	 
	In accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation, restriction or disqualification from participation in extracurricular activities
	 
	Reassignment to an alternative educational environment
	 
	Suspension and expulsion in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48900.5, when a student's misbehavior may result in a referral for suspension or expulsion after other means of correction have failed, the district may document and place in the student's record any other means of correction used to address the behavior. The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
When, by law or district policy, other means of correction are required to be implemented before a student could be suspended or expelled, any other means of correction implemented shall be documented and retained in the student's records.  (Education Code 48900.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 48900.5, as amended by AB 1165 (Ch. 22, Statutes of 2023), the district is encouraged to have a student who has been suspended, or for whom other means of correction have been implemented pursuant to Education Code 48900.5 for an incident of racist bullying, harassment, or intimidation, as well as the victim, to engage in a restorative justice practice suitable to address the needs of both the victim and the perpetrator, in addition to the other measures specified in the following paragraph.
When a student has been suspended, or other means of correction have been implemented against the student, for an incident of racist bullying, harassment, or intimidation, the principal or designee shall engage both the victim and perpetrator in a restorative justice practice suitable to the needs of the students. The principal or designee shall also require the perpetrator to engage in a culturally sensitive program that promotes racial justice and equity and combats racism and ignorance and shall regularly check on the victim to ensure that the victim is not in danger of suffering from any long-lasting mental health issues.  (Education Code 48900.5)

CSBA NOTE: On July 19, 2022, The United States Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights and Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services issued new guidance, "Supporting Students with Disabilities and Avoiding the Discriminatory Use of Student Discipline under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973," to help schools support students with disabilities and avoid discriminatory discipline practices.
Staff shall enforce disciplinary rules fairly, consistently, and in accordance with the district's nondiscrimination policies.

When disciplining a student who has been identified for special education and related services, the procedures specified in Administrative Regulation 5144.2 - Suspension And Expulsion/Due Process (Students With Disabilities) shall be applied. If a student has not been identified as a student with a disability and the district suspects the behavior that resulted in discipline may be based in an unidentified disability, the district shall conduct an evaluation to determine if the student has a disability which requires an IEP or 504 plan.  (U.S.C. 1412(a)(3))

Detention After School

Students may be detained for disciplinary reasons for up to one hour after the close of the maximum school day, or until the departure of the school bus to which they have been assigned if applicable.  (5 CCR 307, 353)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph should be modified to reflect district practice.
The student shall not be detained unless the principal or designee notifies the parent/guardian.

Students shall remain under the supervision of a certificated employee during the period of detention.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is offered for districts that use Saturday classes for purposes of detention. Education Code 37223 authorizes the use of Saturday classes; however, except in the case of truants, attendance at such classes must be at the election of the student, or parent/guardian when the student is a minor.
Students may be offered the choice of serving their detention on Saturday rather than after school.

Community Service

As part of or instead of disciplinary action, the Board, Superintendent, principal, or principal's designee may require a student to perform community service during nonschool hours on school grounds or, with written permission of the student's parent/guardian, off school grounds. Such service may include, but is not limited to, community or school outdoor beautification, community or campus betterment, and teacher, peer, or youth assistance programs.  (Education Code 48900.6)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48900.6 provides that the community service option is not available for those students who have been suspended, pending expulsion, for acts qualifying for either "mandatory recommendation for expulsion" or "mandatory expulsion" pursuant to Education Code 48915. See BP 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process.
This community service option is not available for a student who has been suspended, pending expulsion, pursuant to Education Code 48915. However, if the recommended expulsion is not implemented or the expulsion itself is suspended, then the student may be required to perform community service for the resulting suspension.  (Education Code 48900.6)

Notice to Parents/Guardians and Students

At the beginning of the school year, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians, in writing, about the availability of district rules related to discipline.  (Education Code 35291, 48980)

The Superintendent or designee shall also provide written notice of disciplinary rules to parents/guardians of transfer students at the time of their enrollment in the district.
