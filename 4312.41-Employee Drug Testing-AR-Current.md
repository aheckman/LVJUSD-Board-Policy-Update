## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation is for use by districts implementing a pre-employment drug/alcohol screening program for prospective employees in safety-sensitive positions as identified in Board policy and should be modified to reflect district practice.
Pre-Employment Drug/Alcohol Screening for Safety-Sensitive Positions

CSBA NOTE: Job applicants may have an expectation of privacy related to the procedure used for drug and alcohol screening.  Courts will therefore analyze whether the testing procedure unreasonably intrudes upon the applicant's privacy.  Districts should make efforts to ensure that the laboratory procedure ensures individual privacy (e.g., taking samples in a private restroom).
Applicants shall sign a form consenting to the drug and alcohol testing.  The consent form shall authorize release of the test results to the district.  To ensure an individual's privacy, the district shall not use test results for any purpose other than those stated in Board policy and administrative regulation, shall maintain the confidentiality of screening records, and shall not disclose such records unless the applicant consents or the Superintendent or designee is presented with a court order requiring the disclosure.

All initial screening tests shall be conducted at the district's expense.  If an applicant's initial test is positive, a second test, at the district's expense, shall be administered as soon as possible to confirm the results.  Upon obtaining a second positive result, the applicant may seek an independent drug and alcohol screening from a recognized medical laboratory at his/her own expense.  Any applicant who fails to provide the district with a negative drug and alcohol screening report within five working days of a confirmed positive result shall be determined to have failed the screening and shall not be employed.

Failure to submit to the process or to complete the process shall preclude the applicant from being hired into the position.  Disqualified applicants shall not be prohibited from applying for another job within the district.
