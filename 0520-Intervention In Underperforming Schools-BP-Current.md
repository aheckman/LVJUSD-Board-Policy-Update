## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52059.5, California has established a single statewide system of support for districts and schools that meets state requirements as well as federal Title I requirements. The following policy reflects the purposes and requirements of the statewide system and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board desires that all district schools provide a high-quality educational program that maximizes the achievement of each district student. The district shall provide assistance to schools to support the continuous improvement of student performance within the priorities identified in the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) and to enhance the achievement of low-performing student subgroups.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52071, technical assistance is required to be provided if a numerically significant student subgroup is not making sufficient progress toward its local control and accountability plan (LCAP) goals pursuant to Education Code 52064.5. Technical assistance includes, but is not limited to (1) identifying a district's strengths and weaknesses in regard to state priorities, (2) working collaboratively to secure assistance from academic, programmatic, or fiscal experts to identify and implement effective programs and practices designed to improve performance in any areas of weakness, (3) obtaining timely documentation from the district demonstrating that it has completed the above activities or substantially similar activities, or it has selected another service provider to work with the school district to complete the above activities, and (4) requesting that the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence (CCEE) provide advice and assistance to the district.Education Code 52071, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), expands technical assistance provided on this basis to include identifying student subgroups that are low performing or experiencing significant disparities from other student subgroups as identified on the California School Dashboard, and reviewing the district's LCAP to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses in the identified goals, actions, and services, with a particular focus on those areas considered to be contributing toward meeting the increased or improved services requirement and all required goals.Education Code 52071, as amended by SB 114, creates a new basis for technical assistance when a district fails to meet the data submission requirements of Education Code 60900. In this circumstance, technical assistance includes, but is not limited to (1) identifying a district's strengths and weaknesses in regard to state priorities, (2) working collaboratively to secure assistance from academic, programmatic, or fiscal experts to identify and implement effective programs and practices designed to improve performance in any areas of weakness, (3) obtaining timely documentation from the district demonstrating that it has completed the above activities or substantially similar activities, or it has selected another service provider to work with the school district to complete the above activities, (4) requesting that CCEE provide advice and assistance to the district, (5) reviewing the district's LCAP to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses in the identified goals, actions, and services, with a particular focus on those areas considered to be contributing toward meeting the increased or improved services requirement and all required goals, and (6) reviewing the district's data management policies and collection and submission processes, including monitoring and oversight of the student information system, to ensure the timely submission of accurate data.In addition to technical assistance as described above, the Board may request technical assistance from the County Superintendent of Schools, who may be required to provide it, but the district may be assessed a fee, not to exceed the cost of the service.Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 114, has been expanded to include long-term English learners as a numerically significant subgroup, separate from English learners. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), a "long-term English learner" is defined as a student who has not attained English language proficiency within seven years of initial classification as an English learner.
At its discretion, the Board may submit a request to the County Superintendent of Schools for technical assistance regarding the following:  (Education Code 52071)

	Identifying the district's strengths and weaknesses in regard to state priorities addressed in the LCAP, including collaboration between the district and County Superintendent to review performance data on the state and local indicators included in the California School Dashboard, educator qualifications data, and other relevant local data and to identify effective, evidence-based programs or practices that address any areas of weakness
	 
	Identifying student subgroups that are low performing or experiencing significant disparities from other subgroups as identified on the California School Dashboard in order to identify and implement effective programs and practices to improve the outcomes and opportunities for these students
	 
	Securing assistance from an academic, programmatic, or fiscal expert, or team of experts, to identify and implement effective programs and practices that are designed to improve performance in any areas of weakness identified by the district
	 
	Identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses in the identified goals, actions, and services addressed in the LCAP, with a particular focus on those areas considered to be contributing toward meeting the increased or improved services requirement and all required goals
	 
	Reviewing the district's data management policies and collection and submission processes, including monitoring and oversight of the student information system, to ensure the submission of accurate data according to the processes and timelines established by the California Department of Education (CDE)

In the event that the County Superintendent requires the district to receive technical assistance based on a determination that one or more numerically significant student subgroups in a district school meet the performance criteria established pursuant Education Code 52064.5, the district shall, for a minimum of two years, maintain regular communication with, and provide timely documentation to, the County Superintendent regarding the district's completion of the activities listed in Items #1-5 above, or substantially similar activities.  (Education Code 52071)

The district may, at its own expense, engage another service provider, including, but not limited to, another school district, the county office of education, or a charter school, to act as a partner to the district in filling the district's need for technical assistance.  (Education Code 52071)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52074, the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) may refer a district to CCEE if it is determined to be necessary to help the district accomplish the goals set forth in the district's LCAP. Additionally, following the provision of technical assistance pursuant to Education Code 52071, the County Superintendent and the geographic lead agency may agree to refer the district to CCEE if it is determined to be necessary to help the district accomplish the goals set forth in the district's LCAP. If a district receives an emergency apportionment pursuant to Education Code 41320-41322, the district shall be deemed to have been referred to CCEE. Pursuant to Education Code 52074, as amended by SB 114, other than the circumstances described above, only a district that is eligible for technical assistance pursuant to Education Code 52071 may request advice and assistance from CCEE.Education Code 52072, as repealed and added by SB 114, provides that if the district meets the performance criteria for assistance and intervention pursuant to Education Code 52064.5 for three or more student subgroups, or all of the district's subgroups if the district has less than three subgroups, in three out of the four consecutive school years, CCEE will consult with the district and any provider of technical assistance to determine if assistance from CCEE is necessary. When making this determination, primary consideration will be given to the needs of the students in the district. Any resulting technical assistance will be facilitated by CCEE, in collaboration with the County Superintendent, and focus on building the district's capacity to develop and implement actions and services responsive to student and community needs pursuant to Section 52071 in a manner that streamlines improvement efforts for the school district.
The district shall consider any recommendations from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence in order to accomplish the goals set forth in the district's LCAP.  (Education Code 52071, 52072, 52074)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52072.1, as added by SB 114, provides that the SPI, with approval of the State Board of Education (SBE), may intervene when a district is identified by CCEE pursuant to Education Code 52072 as either (1) failing, or being unable to implement the recommendations of CCEE, or (2) based on the California School Dashboard, exhibiting inadequate performance that is so persistent or acute as to require intervention by the SPI.For any district identified as needing intervention, the SPI or an academic trustee appointed by the SPI may, with approval of the SBE, take one or more of the actions listed in items #1-3 below.
If the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) identifies the district as needing intervention, the district shall cooperate with any action taken by the SPI or any academic advisor appointed by the SPI, which may include one or more of the following:  (Education Code 52072.1)

	Revision of the district's LCAP
	 
	Revision of the district's budget, in conjunction with changes in the LCAP, that would allow the district to improve the outcomes for all student subgroups in regard to state and local priorities
	 
	A determination to stay or rescind any district action that would prevent the district from improving outcomes for all student subgroups, provided that action is not required by a collective bargaining agreement

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6311, based on data in the Dashboard, schools that are in the lowest performing five percent statewide of schools receiving federal Title I funding, as well as high schools with a graduation rate lower than 68 percent averaged over three years, are identified by the California Department of Education (CDE) for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI). Schools are identified for targeted support and improvement if one or more numerically significant student subgroups meet the criteria for the lowest performing five percent of Title I schools, or for additional targeted support and improvement if one student group, on its own, meets these criteria. More information on CSI, including CDE's, "2022 Dashboard Technical Guide: Every Student Succeeds Act School Support," is available on CDE's website. For program requirements, see BP 0520.1 - Comprehensive and Targeted Support and Improvement.
In addition, any school identified by CDE for comprehensive support and improvement, targeted support and improvement, or additional targeted support and improvement shall develop and implement a school plan in accordance with 20 USC 6311. Such schools may be required to partner with an external entity, agency, or individual with demonstrated expertise and capacity to identify and implement more rigorous interventions.

Any resulting technical assistance will be facilitated by CCEE, in collaboration with the County Superintendent, and focus on building the district's capacity to develop and implement actions and services responsive to student and community needs pursuant to Section 52071 in a manner that streamlines improvement efforts for the school district.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="INjkMQ2" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22INjkMQ2%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22MNQ224%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1702331418%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2052074%2C%20the%20Superintendent%20of%20Public%20Instruction%20%28SPI%29%20may%20refer%20a%20district%20to%20CCEE%20if%20it%20is%20determined%20to%20be%20necessary%20to%20help%20the%20district%20accomplish%20the%20goals%20set%20forth%20in%20the%20district%27s%20LCAP.%20Additionally%2C%20following%20the%20provision%20of%20technical%20assistance%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2052071%2C%20the%20County%20Superintendent%20and%20the%20geographic%20lead%20agency%20may%20agree%20to%20refer%20the%20district%20to%20CCEE%20if%20it%20is%20determined%20to%20be%20necessary%20to%20help%20the%20district%20accomplish%20the%20goals%20set%20forth%20in%20the%20district%27s%20LCAP.%20If%20a%20district%20receives%20an%20emergency%20apportionment%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2041320-41322%2C%20the%20district%20shall%20be%20deemed%20to%20have%20been%20referred%20to%20CCEE.%20Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2052074%2C%20as%20amended%20by%20SB%20114%2C%20other%20than%20the%20circumstances%20described%20above%2C%20only%20a%20district%20that%20is%20eligible%20for%20technical%20assistance%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2052071%20may%20request%20advice%20and%20assistance%20from%20CCEE.%5Cn%5CnEducation%20Code%2052072%2C%20as%20repealed%20and%20added%20by%20SB%20114%2C%20provides%20that%20if%20the%20district%20meets%20the%20performance%20criteria%20for%20assistance%20and%20intervention%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2052064.5%20for%20three%20or%20more%20student%20subgroups%2C%20or%20all%20of%20the%20district%27s%20subgroups%20if%20the%20district%20has%20less%20than%20three%20subgroups%2C%20in%20three%20out%20of%20the%20four%20consecutive%20school%20years%2C%20CCEE%20will%20consult%20with%20the%20district%20and%20any%20provider%20of%20technical%20assistance%20to%20determine%20if%20assistance%20from%20CCEE%20is%20necessary.%20When%20making%20this%20determination%2C%20primary%20consideration%20will%20be%20given%20to%20the%20needs%20of%20the%20students%20in%20the%20district.%20Any%20resulting%20technical%20assistance%20will%20be%20facilitated%20by%20CCEE%2C%20in%20collaboration%20with%20the%20County%20Superintendent%2C%20and%20focus%20on%20building%20the%20district%27s%20capacity%20to%20develop%20and%20implement%20actions%20and%20services%20responsive%20to%20student%20and%20community%20needs%20pursuant%20to%20Section%2052071%20in%20a%20manner%20that%20streamlines%20improvement%20efforts%20for%20the%20school%20district.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-INjkMQ2" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52074, the S..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
