## Policy Content

Qualifications/Assignment of Special Education Teachers

CSBA NOTE: Individuals providing instruction in special education must possess an appropriate credential or added authorization issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) permitting such service, including the (1) education specialist credential, which includes specializations in mild/moderate disabilities, moderate/severe disabilities, deaf and hard of hearing, visual impairments, physical and health impairments, early childhood special education, and language and academic development; (2) previously issued special education credential; (3) speech-language pathology services credential; or (4) clinical or rehabilitative services credential authorizing the provision of audiology and/or orientation and mobility services.Teachers who receive an added authorization may be assigned to serve students in the broad specialty area pursuant to their credential and in the specific area of the added authorization. 5 CCR 80048.7 allows credential holders to obtain added authorizations in the following areas: autism spectrum disorders (ASD), deaf-blind, emotional disturbance, orthopedically impaired, other health impaired, and traumatic brain injury. In addition, holders of a valid prerequisite teaching credential authorizing the teaching of physical education in any grade K-12 or a credential authorizing instruction or services in special education may obtain an added authorization pursuant to 5 CCR 80046.1 to provide adapted physical education to students with special needs who are unable to participate in a general physical education program. Holders of a special education teaching credential may obtain an added authorization pursuant to 5 CCR 80048.5 to provide early childhood special education to children from birth through prekindergarten. An added authorization to provide resource specialist services may be granted pursuant to 5 CCR 80070.1-80070.5 to a person who holds a special education credential, but is unnecessary for holders of education specialist credentials issued since September 1997 since that credential already includes an authorization to provide resource specialist services. An option that allowed districts, under certain conditions, to assign teachers who possess the mild/moderate disabilities specialization to provide instruction to students with ASD expired in 2013. Preliminary education specialist credential programs now include ASD content for all specialty areas, and preliminary and clear credentials authorize the holder to provide ASD services within their specialty areas.
Any teacher assigned to serve students with disabilities shall possess an appropriate credential or other authorization issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) that specifically authorizes him/her to teach students with the primary disability within the program placement recommended in the students' individualized education program (IEP).  (5 CCR 80046.1-80048.9.4)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44325, the CTC issues special education district intern credentials which authorize their holders to provide classroom instruction to students with disabilities.  For requirements pertaining to internship programs, see BP/AR 4112.21 - Interns.
The district may employ a person with an appropriate district intern credential to provide classroom instruction to students with disabilities, provided he/she has met the subject matter requirement specified in Education Code 44325 and receives guidance, supervision, and professional development through an established district intern program.  (Education Code 44325, 44326, 44830.3)

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 80027.1 establishes the special education limited assignment teaching permit which allows a special education credential holder to serve outside his/her specialty area while completing the coursework for an added authorization in special education or an additional full specialty area in another special education area. The permit is valid for up to one year from the date of issuance but may be renewed twice, for a total of three years in the specialty area, if renewal requirements are met.
The Superintendent or designee may request that the CTC issue a special education limited assignment teaching permit which authorizes a qualified special education teacher, with his/her written consent, to serve outside the specialty area of his/her credential. If the teacher has not yet obtained permanent status, the Superintendent or designee shall assign one or more experienced educators in the special education subject area(s) of the permit, who have at least three years of full-time teaching experience in each of the subject area(s) of the permit, to provide guidance and assistance to the permit holder.  (5 CCR 80026, 80027.1)

As needed, the district may apply to the CTC for an emergency permit for resource specialist services pursuant to 5 CCR 80023.2 and 80024.3.1.

CSBA NOTE: When requesting that the CTC issue a special education limited assignment teaching permit or an emergency resource specialist permit, the district must submit a Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators in accordance with 5 CCR 80026. The form for the Declaration of Need is available in the CTC's online Credential Information Guide, which may be accessed only by employers. Pursuant to 5 CCR 80026, the Declaration of Need is valid for up to 12 months, but expires no later than June 30 following its submission to the CTC. See BP 4112.2 - Certification for additional information regarding the Declaration of Need.
When requesting either a limited assignment teaching permit or an emergency resource specialist permit, the Superintendent or designee shall submit a Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators that satisfies the requirements of 5 CCR 80026 and has been approved by the Board at a regularly scheduled Board meeting. (5 CCR 80026)

CSBA NOTE: Note: Pursuant to 5 CCR 80021.1, if the district is unable to employ a suitable credentialed teacher after a diligent search, it may request that the CTC issue a provisional internship permit (PIP) to a qualified candidate for one year. Pursuant to 5 CCR 80021, the district may request that the CTC issue a short-term staff permit (STSP) when there is a need to immediately fill a classroom vacancy. See BP/AR 4112.2 - Certification for requirements related to these permits. When the district is unable to hire a person with the STSP or PIP, the district may request that the CTC issue a short-term or variable term waiver.Before the district applies for the STSP, PIP, or a waiver, the CTC recommends that the district first seek a special education limited assignment permit if an individual meets the requirements for that permit. See theCTC's Special Education Teaching and Services Credentials, Added Authorizations in Special Education, and Limited Assignment Permits for California Prepared Teachers: Frequently Asked Questions, available on its web site.
If there is a need to immediately fill a classroom vacancy or a suitable credentialed teacher cannot be found after a diligent search, the Superintendent or designee may, as appropriate, apply to the CTC for a short-term staff permit pursuant to 5 CCR 80021, a provisional internship permit pursuant to 5 CCR 80021.1, or, as a last resort, a credential waiver.

Individuals providing related services to students with disabilities, including developmental, corrective, and other supportive and related services, shall meet the applicable qualifications specified in 5 CCR 3051-3051.24.  (5 CCR 3051; 34 CFR 300.34, 300.156)

The Superintendent or designee shall provide ongoing professional development as needed to assist special education staff in updating and improving their knowledge and skills.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 80048.8.1, completion of a CTC-approved induction program offered by either a district or a college/university is a requirement to earn a clear credential. Also see BP 4131.1 - Teacher Support and Guidance.
Whenever a candidate for a clear education specialist credential is employed by the district, the Superintendent or designee shall, within 60 days of employment, collaborate with the candidate and, as applicable, with the college or university to develop an individualized induction plan including supported induction and job-related course of advanced preparation. (5 CCR 80048.8.1)

Resource Specialists
CSBA NOTE: Education Code 56195.8 mandates entities providing special education to adopt policy related to resource specialists. The following section fulfills this mandate and should be revised for consistency with the policy and regulations of the Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) in which the district participates.  Also see language on caseloads for resource specialists in the section "Caseloads" below.

The duties of resource specialists shall include, but are not limited to:  (Education Code 56362; 5 CCR 80070.5)

	Providing instruction and services for students with disabilities whose needs have been identified in an IEP
	 
	Conducting educational assessments
	 
	Providing information and assistance for students with disabilities and their parents/guardians
	 
	Providing consultation, resource information, and material regarding students with disabilities to staff members in the regular education program and the students' parents/guardians
	 
	Coordinating special education services with the regular school program for each student with disabilities enrolled in the resource specialist program
	 
	Monitoring student progress on a regular basis, participating in the review and revision of IEPs as appropriate, and referring students who do not demonstrate appropriate progress to the IEP team
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #7 below should be deleted by districts that do not maintain secondary schools.
	Providing services for secondary students that emphasize academic achievement, career and vocational development, and preparation for adult life
	
	Any student who receives resource specialist services shall be assigned to regular classroom teacher(s) for a majority of the school day, unless his/her IEP team approves enrollment in the resource specialist program for a majority of the school day.   (Education Code 56362; 5 CCR 80070.5)

Resource specialists shall not simultaneously be assigned to serve as resource specialists and to teach regular classes.  (Education Code 56362)

The district's resource specialist program shall be under the direction of a resource specialist who possesses the qualifications specified in Education Code 56362.

Caseloads

CSBA NOTE: The following section should be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 56362 specifies maximum caseloads for resource specialists. Education Code 56363.3 and 56441.7 specify caseloads for language, speech, and hearing specialists. Other special education caseloads are not set by law and may be determined through collective bargaining agreements or the policies and regulations of the SELPA in which the district participates.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that caseloads for special education teachers are within the maximum caseloads established by law, the collective bargaining agreement, and/or the comprehensive plan of the Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) in which the district participates.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 56195.8 and 56362 mandate that each entity providing special education adopt policy that includes caseloads for resource specialists. Such caseloads must not exceed 28 students per resource specialist except as provided below. The following paragraph should be revised as necessary for consistency with SELPA and district practice.In addition, pursuant to Education Code 56362, at least 80 percent of the resource specialists within a SELPA must be provided with an instructional aide.
No resource specialist shall have a caseload which exceeds 28 students.  As necessary and with the agreement of the resource specialist, the Governing Board may request a waiver from the State Board of Education to increase the caseload to no more than 32 students, provided that an individual resource specialist does not have a caseload exceeding 28 students for more than two school years and has the assistance of an instructional aide at least five hours daily during the period of the waiver.  (Education Code 56362, 56362.1; 5 CCR 3100)

The average caseload for language, speech, and hearing specialists shall not exceed 55 cases, unless the SELPA plan specifies a higher average caseload and states the reasons for the higher average caseload. The maximum caseload for speech and language specialists exclusively serving children with disabilities age 3-5 years shall not exceed 40.  (Education Code 56363.3, 56441.7)
