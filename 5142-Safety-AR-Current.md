Activities with Safety Risks

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section lists activities that might be prohibited by the district because of high risk to student safety and should be revised to reflect district practice.Pursuant to Government Code 831.7, public entities, including districts, are not liable to participants in a hazardous recreational activity, those who assist participants, or spectators for any damage to person or property arising out of the hazardous recreational activity when the person knew or reasonably should have known that the hazardous recreational activity created a substantial risk of injury and was voluntarily in the place of risk or having the ability to leave but failed to do so. Government Code 831.7 defines a "hazardous recreational activity" as a recreational activity conducted on school grounds that creates a substantial risk of injury, as distinguished from a minor, trivial, or insignificant risk of injury. The list below includes, but is not limited to, some of the hazardous recreational activities listed in Government Code 831.7. Prior to authorizing such activities, it is recommended that districts consult with their insurance carrier or joint powers authority or, for those who self-insure, with CSBA District and County Offices of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel. See BP/AR 3530 - Risk Management/Insurance.
Due to concerns about the risk to student safety, the principal or designee shall not permit the following activities on campus or during school-sponsored events unless the activity is properly supervised, students wear protective gear as appropriate, and each participant has insurance coverage:
