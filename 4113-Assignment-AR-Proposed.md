Procedures for verifying a teacher's subject matter knowledge shall be developed and implemented by the Superintendent or designee with the involvement of appropriate subject matter specialists, including curriculum specialists, resource teachers, classroom teachers certified to teach the subject, staff assigned to regional subject matter projects or curriculum institutes, or college faculty.  (Education Code 44258.3)

Whenever a teacher is assigned to teach departmentalized classes pursuant to Education Code 44258.3, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the exclusive representative of the District's certificated employees.  (Education Code 44258.3)

Assignment to Elective Courses Outside Credential Authorization

The Superintendent or designee shall establish a committee on assignments, consisting of an equal number of teachers selected by teachers and school administrators selected by school administrators, to approve such assignments.  (Education Code 44258.7)

Assignments approved by the committee shall be for a maximum of one school year, but may be extended by action of the committee upon application by the principal and teacher.  (Education Code 44258.7)
