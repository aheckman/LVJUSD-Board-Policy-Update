## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes its responsibility to establish an evaluation system that enables a fair assessment of the Superintendent's effectiveness in leading the District toward established goals, serves to support his/her continued growth in leadership and management skills, and provides a basis for Board decisions regarding contract extension and compensation. The Board shall annually conduct a formal evaluation of the Superintendent's performance and may provide additional opportunities throughout the year to review the Superintendent's progress toward meeting established goals.

The Board shall determine, with the Superintendent's input, the criteria, schedule, method(s), and instrument(s) to be used for the Superintendent's evaluation. Evaluation criteria shall include, but are not limited to, District goals and success indicators; educational, management, and community leadership skills; and the Superintendent's professional relationship with the Board.

Prior to the evaluation, the Superintendent shall provide to the Board for its review a report of progress toward District goals, the Superintendent's self-appraisal of accomplishments and performance, and a statement of actions taken to address any Board recommendations from the previous evaluation.

Each Board member shall independently evaluate the Superintendent's performance based upon the evaluation criteria, after which the Board shall produce a single document that integrates the individual evaluations and represents the consensus of the Board.

The evaluation shall provide commendations in areas of strength and achievement and recommendations for improving effectiveness in any areas of need, concern, or unsatisfactory performance.

The Board shall meet in closed session with the Superintendent to discuss the evaluation.  (Government Code 54957)

At this meeting, the Superintendent shall have an opportunity to ask questions, respond verbally and in writing to the evaluation, and present additional information regarding his/her performance or District progress.

The discussion shall include the establishment of performance goals for the next year and may identify professional development opportunities for the Superintendent and/or the entire governance team to address areas of concern, strengthen the relationship between the Superintendent and Board, or enhance the Superintendent's knowledge of current educational issues and leadership and management skills.

After the Board and Superintendent have discussed the evaluation, the Board president and Superintendent shall sign the evaluation and it shall be placed in the Superintendent's personnel file. The evaluation, including personal performance goals, shall be confidential to the extent permitted by law.
