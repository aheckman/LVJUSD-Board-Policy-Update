## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that education is a lifelong endeavor and that it is important for individuals to continuously develop new skills necessary to participate effectively as citizens, workers, parents/guardians, and family and community members. Eligible adults shall be offered opportunities to enroll in programs and courses that develop academic and workforce skills and, as appropriate, lead to completion of requirements for high school graduation.

The Superintendent or designee shall recommend, for approval by the Board and the California Department of Education, courses to be offered through the District's adult education program.

Adult education classes may be offered any day or evening, including weekends, for such length of time during the school year as determined by the Board.  (Education Code 52505)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all teachers of adult education classes possess an appropriate credential issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and have access to high-quality professional development to continuously enhance their knowledge and skills.

Upon recommendation of the administrator of the student's adult school or noncredit program of attendance, the Board may authorize an adult education student pursuing a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate to attend a community college during any session or term as a special part-time student.  (Education Code 52620)

The Board may award diplomas or certificates to adults and eligible minors enrolled in adult schools upon satisfactory completion of a prescribed course of study in an elementary school program.  (Education Code 52508, 52509)

Adult education students who fulfill the District's graduation requirements shall receive a diploma of high school graduation.

If the District has an adult school or classes for adults but is unable to maintain such school or classes because of an inability to secure a teacher(s) or because of a lack of facilities, the District may, with the approval of the County Superintendent of Schools and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, contract with another District for the instruction of such students.  (Education Code 52511)

To ensure efficient and coordinated adult education services, the District may join a regional adult education consortium. The District shall participate in the consortium's identification of the educational needs of adults in the region, identification of available funding and services, development and approval of an adult education plan pursuant to Education Code 84906, and implementation of strategies to address the identified needs, improve the effectiveness of District services, and improve students' transitions into postsecondary education and the workforce.

The District's representative to the regional adult education consortium shall be designated by the Board.  (Education Code 84905)

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board on the effectiveness of the District's adult education program. This report shall include, but not be limited to, the number of adults and high school students participating in the program, student participation in each type of adult education course or class, and the extent to which students successfully completed these programs, including, as applicable, the completion of requirements for the high school diploma or certificate of equivalency.
