## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 234.7, districts were mandated to adopt policies, by June 1, 2018, with language that is equivalent to the model policy language developed by the California Attorney General in "Promoting a Safe and Secure Learning Environment for All: Guidance and Model Policies to Assist California's K-12 Schools in Responding to Immigration Issues," first published in April 2018 ("2018 Guidance"). The Attorney General updated the 2018 Guidance in December 2024 ("2024 Guidance") and has stated that districts "should" adopt or update their policies based on the 2024 Guidance by May 1, 2025. The 2024 Guidance is available on the Office of the Attorney General's website.Since the legal landscape regarding a district's response to immigration enforcement is in flux and additional legislation is currently pending, it is recommended that districts consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Service or district legal counsel when adopting this policy.See the accompanying Board policy, BP 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities, BP/AR 5111 - Admission, AR 5111.1 - District Residency, BP/AR 5125 - Student Records, AR/E 5125.1 - Release of Directory Information, and BP 5131.2 - Bullying for additional language fulfilling this mandate.The Attorney General recommends that, if feasible, districts designate an immigrant affairs liaison to facilitate training programs for staff, help provide non-legal advice to families, and assist in communications with other educational agencies and local and state government stakeholders. The following administrative regulation may be revised to reflect any such position established by the district.
Responding to Requests for Immigration-Related Information or Documents

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.7 prohibits the collection of information or documents regarding the citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members, except as required by state or federal law, or as required to administer a state or federally supported education program. If the district becomes aware of the citizenship or immigration status of any student, it is prohibited from disclosing that information except in limited circumstances, such as when parent/guardian consent, a court order, or a judicial subpoena/warrant is provided.
Upon receiving any verbal or written request for information or documents related to a student's or family's immigration or citizenship status, district staff shall:

	Record or otherwise document the request and notify the Superintendent or designee about the request
	 
	Provide the student's parent/guardian or, if the student is at least 18 years old, the student, with notice, a description of the request, and any documentation provided to the district describing the request, unless prohibited by a court order, judicial subpoena/warrant, or in cases involving investigation of child abuse, neglect, or dependency

Information or documents related to a student's immigration or citizenship status shall not be disclosed to a law enforcement officer without consent by the parent/guardian or, if the student is at least 18 years old, by the student, a court order, or judicial subpoena/warrant. To obtain written consent, the release of student information shall include the following information:


	The signature and signature date of the parent/guardian, or student if the student is at least 18 years old
	 
	A description of the records to be disclosed
	 
	The reason for the release of information
	 
	The parties or class of parties receiving the information
	 
	A copy of the records to be released, if requested by the parent/guardian or student

In accordance with law and Board Policy 5125 - Student Records, the Superintendent or designee shall annually notify parents/guardians that the district will not release student information to third parties for immigration enforcement purposes, unless the parent/guardian consents or as required to do so by a court order or judicial subpoena/warrant.

Responding to Requests for Access to Students or School Grounds

District staff shall receive parent/guardian consent or, if the student is at least 18 years old, the student's consent, before the student is interviewed or searched by any law enforcement officer for immigration enforcement purposes, unless the officer presents a court order or a judicial warrant.

A student's parent/guardian shall be immediately notified when a law enforcement officer requests or is able to interview, search, detain, or otherwise interact with the student for immigration enforcement purposes, unless prohibited by a court order or a judicial warrant, or in cases involving investigations of child abuse, neglect, or dependency.  (Education Code 48906)

CSBA NOTE: The Attorney General's model policy includes requirements that the district post signs at school entrances containing school hours and registration requirements and that the district adopt measures for responding to outsiders in a manner that avoids classroom interruptions. See BP/AR 1250 - Visitors/Outsiders for procedures applicable to all visitors.
A law enforcement officer who requests to enter district property which is not open to all visitors shall register in accordance with Board Policy 1250 - Visitors/Outsiders, except in cases where the officer states that exigent circumstances exist or as stated in a court order or judicial warrant.  (Penal Code 627.2, 627.3)

As early as possible, district staff shall notify the Superintendent or designee of any immigration enforcement-related request by a law enforcement officer for access to a student or to district property, including service of lawful warrants, subpoenas, petitions, complaints, or other similar documents.

Responding to Law Enforcement Officers on District Property

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be modified by districts that do not maintain a district police or security department.
District staff shall report the presence of any law enforcement officer on district property for immigration enforcement purposes to on-site district police and other appropriate administrators.

Unless a law enforcement officer declares that exigent circumstances exist and demands immediate access to the campus, district staff shall take the following actions when such an officer is actually or imminently present on district property for immigration enforcement purposes:

	Advise the officer that before school personnel can respond to the officer's request, they must first receive notification and direction from the Superintendent, principal, or designee, except under exigent circumstances that necessitate immediate action
	 
	Request to see and record or otherwise document the officer's credentials, including the officer's name and badge number, and the phone number of the officer's supervisor, and note or make a copy of all such information
	 
	Ask the officer for, and then record or otherwise document, the officer's reason for being on district property
	 
	Request that the officer produce any documentation that authorizes the officer's school access, make copies of all such documentation, and retain at least one copy for district records
	 
	Contact and consult with the district's legal counsel or Superintendent or designee
	 
	Follow the direction from the district's legal counsel or Superintendent or designee

If the officer declares that exigent circumstances exist and demands immediate access to the campus, district staff shall comply with the officer's orders and immediately contact the Superintendent or designee and then the district's legal counsel.

Regardless of whether the officer declares that exigent circumstances exist, district staff shall not attempt to physically impede the officer, even if the officer appears to be acting outside the law or in excess of the officer's stated or documented authorization. If an officer enters the premises without consent, district staff shall document the officer's actions while on campus but only to the extent that it does not impede the officer's actions.

After the officer leaves district property, district staff shall promptly make written notes of all interactions with the officer, including:

	A list or copy of the officer's credentials and contact information, if known
	 
	The identity of all other district staff known to have communicated with the officer
	 
	A description of the officer's request and activities
	 
	The type of documentation, such as a warrant or subpoena, that authorized the officer's request or actions, what was requested by the documentation, and whether the documentation was signed by a judge
	 
	District staff's response to the officer's request
	 
	Any further action taken by the officer
	 
	Copies of any documents presented by the officer

District staff shall promptly provide a copy of these notes and any associated documents district staff has collected from the officer to the district's legal counsel or other district official designated by the Superintendent.

The district's legal counsel or the Superintendent or designee shall submit a timely report to the Governing Board regarding the officer's requests and actions and the district's response.  (Education Code 234.7)

The Superintendent or designee shall also email the Bureau of Children's Justice in the California Department of Justice (BCJ@doj.ca.gov) regarding any attempt by a law enforcement officer to access a school site or a student for immigration enforcement purposes.

Responding to the Detention or Deportation of Student's Parent/Guardian

The Superintendent or designee shall encourage parents/guardians to update their emergency contact information as needed at any time. The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians that the district will only use information provided on the emergency cards in response to specific emergency situations and not for any other purpose.

The Superintendent or designee may also encourage all students and families to learn their emergency phone numbers and be aware of the location of important documentation, including birth certificates, passports, social security cards, physicians' contact information, medication lists, lists of allergies, and other such information that would allow the students and families to be prepared in the event that a student's parent/guardian is detained or deported.

In the event that a student's parent/guardian is detained or deported, the Superintendent or designee shall release the student to the person(s) designated in the student's emergency contact information or to any individual who presents a caregiver's authorization affidavit on behalf of the student. The Superintendent or designee shall only contact child protective services if district personnel are unable to arrange for the timely care of the student by the person(s) designated in the emergency contact information maintained by the school or identified on a caregiver's authorization affidavit.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48204.4 provides that a student complies with district residency requirements if the student's parent/guardian was a resident of California and departed against the parent/guardian's will due to a transfer by a government agency that had custody of the parent/guardian, a lawful order from a court or government agency authorizing removal, or removal or departure pursuant to the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. See AR 5111.1 - District Residency.
In an instance where a student's parent/guardian was detained or deported, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the student, as well as the individuals designated in the student's emergency contact information and any individual who presented a caregiver's authorization affidavit on behalf of the student, that the student continues to meet the residency requirements for attendance in the district if the student and the student's parent/guardian who was detained or deported satisfy the conditions as specified in Education Code 48204.4.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is recommended, but not required, by the Attorney General's model policy. It should be deleted or modified to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee may refer a student or the student's family members to other resources for assistance, including, but not limited to, an U.S. Immigrant and Customs Enforcement detainee locator, legal assistance, or the consulate or embassy of the parent/guardian's country of origin.

	<li>Request to see and record or otherwise document the officer&#39;s credentials, including the officer&#39;s name and badge number, and the phone number of the officer&#39;s supervisor, and note or make a copy of all such information<br>

<br>
Regardless of whether the officer declares that exigent circumstances exist, district staff shall not attempt to physically impede the officer, even if the officer appears to be acting outside the law or in excess of the officer&#39;s stated or documented authorization. If an officer enters the premises without consent, district staff shall document the officer&#39;s actions while on campus but only to the extent that it does not impede the officer&#39;s actions.<br>
<br>
After the officer leaves district property, district staff shall promptly make written notes of all interactions with the officer, including:

	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The identity of all other district staff known to have communicated with the officer<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A description of the officer&#39;s request and activities<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The type of documentation, such as a warrant or subpoena, that authorized the officer&#39;s request or actions, what was requested by the documentation, and whether the documentation was signed by a judge<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>District staff&#39;s response to the officer&#39;s request<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Any further action taken by the officer<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Copies of any documents presented by the officer</li>
</ol>
District staff shall promptly provide a copy of these notes and any associated documents district staff has collected from the officer to the district&#39;s legal counsel or other district official designated by the Superintendent.<br>
<br>
The district&#39;s legal counsel or the Superintendent or designee shall submit a timely report to the Governing Board regarding the officer&#39;s requests and actions and the district&#39;s response.&nbsp; (Education Code 234.7)<br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall also email the Bureau of Children&#39;s Justice in the California Department of Justice (BCJ@doj.ca.gov) regarding any attempt by a law enforcement officer to access a school site or a student for immigration enforcement purposes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Responding to the Detention or Deportation of Student&#39;s Parent/Guardian</strong><br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall encourage parents/guardians to update their emergency contact information as needed at any time. The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians that the district will only use information provided on the emergency cards in response to specific emergency situations and not for any other purpose.<br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee may also encourage all students and families to learn their emergency phone numbers and be aware of the location of important documentation, including birth certificates, passports, social security cards, physicians&#39; contact information, medication lists, lists of allergies, and other such information that would allow the students and families to be prepared in the event that a student&#39;s parent/guardian is detained or deported.<br>
<br>
In the event that a student&#39;s parent/guardian is detained or deported, the Superintendent or designee shall release the student to the person(s) designated in the student&#39;s emergency contact information or to any individual who presents a caregiver&#39;s authorization affidavit on behalf of the student. The Superintendent or designee shall only contact child protective services if district personnel are unable to arrange for the timely care of the student by the person(s) designated in the emergency contact information maintained by the school or identified on a caregiver&#39;s authorization affidavit.<br>
