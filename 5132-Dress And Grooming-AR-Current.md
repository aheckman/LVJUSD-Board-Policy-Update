## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation should be revised to reflect district practice.
In cooperation with teachers, students, and parents/guardians, the principal or designee may establish school rules governing student dress and grooming which are consistent with law, Board policy, and administrative regulations. These school dress codes shall be regularly reviewed.

CSBA NOTE: Optional items #1-4 below may be revised to reflect district practice.
The following guidelines shall apply to all regular school activities:

	Clothing, jewelry, and personal items shall be free of writing, pictures, or any other insignia which is vulgar, lewd, obscene, profane, or sexually suggestive or which promotes the use of alcohol, drugs, tobacco, or other illegal activity.
	 
	Appropriate shoes must be worn at all times.
	 
	Hats, caps, and other head coverings shall not be worn indoors.
	 
	Clothes shall be sufficient to conceal undergarments. See-through tops and bare abdomens are prohibited.

The dress code shall be modified as appropriate to accommodate a student's religious or cultural observance, health condition, or other circumstance deemed necessary by the principal or designee. In addition, the principal or designee may impose dress requirements to accommodate the needs of special school activities, physical education classes, athletic activities, and other extracurricular and cocurricular activities.

No grade of a student participating in a physical education class shall be adversely affected if the student does not wear standardized physical education apparel because of circumstances beyond the student's control.  (Education Code 49066)

Students shall be allowed to wear sun-protective clothing, including but not limited to hats, for outdoor use during the school day.  (Education Code 35183.5)

Gang-Related Apparel

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts in which individual schools have adopted a dress code prohibiting gang-related apparel pursuant to Education Code 35183. It is recommended that districts consult legal counsel when developing administrative regulations related to gang apparel.
At individual schools that have a dress code prohibiting gang-related apparel at school or school activities, the principal, staff, and parents/guardians participating in the development of the school safety plan shall define "gang-related apparel" and shall limit this definition to apparel that reasonably could be determined to threaten the health and safety of the school environment if it were worn or displayed on a school campus.  (Education Code 32282)

Because gang-related symbols are constantly changing, definitions of gang-related apparel shall be reviewed at least once each semester and updated whenever related information is received. As necessary, the school shall collaborate with law enforcement agencies to update definitions of gang-related apparel.

Uniforms

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use only by districts with schools that have a school uniform policy pursuant to Education Code 35183.
In schools that require a schoolwide uniform, the principal, staff, and parents/guardians of the school shall jointly select the specific uniform to be worn.  (Education Code 35183)

At least six months before a school uniform policy is implemented, the principal or designee shall notify parents/guardians of this policy.  (Education Code 35183)

Parents/guardians shall also be informed of their right to have their child exempted.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish criteria for determining student eligibility for financial assistance when purchasing uniforms.

Students who participate in a nationally recognized youth organization shall be allowed to wear organization uniforms on days when the organization has a scheduled meeting.  (Education Code 35183)
