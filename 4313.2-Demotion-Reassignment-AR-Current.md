## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: For information regarding the transfer of a certificated administrative employee to an identical position at a different location, see BP/AR 4314 - Transfers. For language regarding notice of nonreelection or nonemployment of deputy, associate, or assistant superintendents under a contract, see BP 4312.1 - Contracts. The district should seek legal counsel if a demotion or reassignment is to take place during the school year for cause or involves an employee who is covered by the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.
Certificated Administrative Employees

CSBA NOTE: The courts have found that certificated administrative employees do not possess a statutory right to their positions and, as a result, have no tenure in their administrative positions.  However, pursuant to Education Code 44893, 44894, and 44956.5, certificated administrators earn seniority as certificated employees of the district and thus are subject to the same procedures as other certificated employees in the event of a layoff.  If an administrator is a certificated probationary employee, and the Board determines to not reemploy him/her for the following year, then the district must send a notice of nonreelection pursuant to Education Code 44929.21; see AR 4117.6 - Decision to Not Rehire.
Permanent certificated management staff are not entitled to seniority rights in their administrative positions.  However, such staff shall earn and/or retain any seniority earned in service as a classroom teacher or site administrator pursuant to Education Code 44893, 44894, or 44956.5. 

End of Year Release/Reassignment of Certificated Administrators

CSBA NOTE: Note: In Ellerbroek v. Saddleback Valley School District, the court held that, if notice of release/reassignment is not given by March 15 for the following year, a change in assignment may only occur "for cause" and the employee must be provided due process (i.e., notice, reasons, documentation, and the right to respond)
By March 15, an employee shall be notified by either registered mail or in person that he/she may be released or reassigned from his/her position for the following school year.  If the notice is presented to the employee in person, the district shall obtain his/her signature acknowledging receipt of the notice on the district's copy of the written notice.  (Education Code 44951)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is based on the court's decision in Ellerbroek v. Saddleback Valley School District.  If the district's March 15 notice indicates that the release/reassignment is only a possibility, but the district does not send another notice indicating definite release/reassignment by the end of the school year, the employee will remain in the current assignment.
If the March 15 notice indicates that release or reassignment is only a possibility, the Governing Board shall take additional action to release/reassign the employee before the new school year and shall send the employee a second notice by June 30 indicating that he/she has been released or reassigned.

CSBA NOTE: In Hentschke v. Sink, the court held that an administrator serves at the pleasure of the Board and may be removed for any reason satisfactory to the Board.
If the employee is to be released or reassigned to a teaching position, the Board shall give the employee, upon his/her request, a written statement of the reasons for the release/reassignment.  If the reasons include incompetence as an administrator or supervisor, the district shall have completed an evaluation of the employee within the 60-day period immediately preceding the notice date.  (Education Code 44896)
