## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35171 mandates that the Governing Board adopt reasonable regulations related to evaluating the performance of certificated personnel. The following policy and accompanying administrative regulation should be revised to reflect district practice and any applicable provisions of collective bargaining agreements.  Pursuant to Government Code 3543.2, procedures to be used for the evaluation of employees are conditions of employment subject to negotiation.For policy related to the evaluation of certificated administrators and supervisory personnel, see BP 4315 - Evaluation/Supervision.
The Governing Board believes that regular, comprehensive evaluations designed to hold instructional staff accountable for their performance are key to improving their teaching skills and raising students' levels of achievement.

Evaluations shall be used to recognize the exemplary skills and accomplishments of staff and to identify areas needing improvement.  When areas needing improvement are identified, the Board expects employees to accept responsibility for improving their performance and encourages them to take initiative to request assistance as necessary, including participation in appropriate staff development and/or individualized teacher support and guidance programs.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44662 requires the Board to establish evaluation criteria which, at a minimum, must include the criteria listed in items #1-4 below. The following list may be expanded to include additional criteria adopted by the Board. 
The Superintendent or designee shall assess the performance of certificated instructional staff as it reasonably relates to the following criteria:  (Education Code 44662)

	Students' progress toward meeting district standards of expected achievement for their grade level in each area of study and, if applicable, towards the state-adopted content standards as measured by state-adopted criterion-referenced assessments
	 
	The instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee
	 
	The employee's adherence to curricular objectives
	 
	The establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment within the scope of the employee's responsibilities

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.  Education Code 44661.5 authorizes the Board, with the agreement of the exclusive representative of the certificated staff, to include any objective evaluation standards from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and/or the California Standards for the Teaching Profession, as long as the standards are consistent with Education Code 44660-44665.  If the certificated staff do not have an exclusive representative, the Board may adopt objective evaluation and assessment guidelines consistent with Education Code 44661.5.  Districts in which there is no exclusive representative should modify the following paragraph accordingly.
With the agreement of the exclusive representative of the certificated staff when applicable, the Superintendent or designee may incorporate objective standards from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and/or the California Standards for the Teaching Profession into district evaluation standards.

The evaluation of certificated employee performance shall not include the use of publishers' norms established by standardized tests.  (Education Code 44662)

Noninstructional certificated employees shall be evaluated on their performance in fulfilling their defined job responsibilities.  (Education Code 44662)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that evaluation ratings have uniform meaning and are uniformly applied throughout the district.
