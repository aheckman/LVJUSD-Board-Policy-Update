## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 234.7, districts were mandated to adopt policies, by July 1, 2018, with language that is equivalent to the model policy language developed by the California Attorney General in "Promoting a Safe and Secure Learning Environment for All: Guidance and Model Policies to Assist California's K-12 Schools in Responding to Immigration Issues," first published in April 2018 ("2018 Guidance"). The Attorney General updated the 2018 Guidance in December 2024 ("2024 Guidance") and has stated that districts "should" adopt or update their policies based on the 2024 Guidance by May 1, 2025. The 2024 Guidance is available on the Office of the Attorney General's website.Since the legal landscape regarding a district's response to immigration enforcement is in flux and additional legislation is currently pending, it is recommended that districts consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Service or district legal counsel when adopting this policy.See the accompanying administrative regulation, BP 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities, BP/AR 5111 - Admission, AR 5111.1 - District Residency, BP/AR 5125 - Student Records, AR/E 5125.1 - Release of Directory Information, and BP 5131.2 - Bullying for additional language that is equivalent to the model policy language in the 2018 Guidance and 2024 Guidance.
The Governing Board is committed to the success of all students and believes that every school site should be a safe and welcoming place for all students and their families irrespective of their citizenship or immigration status.

District staff shall not solicit or collect information or documents, and shall not seek or require information or documents to the exclusion of other permissible information or documents, regarding the citizenship or immigration status of a student or the student's family members.  (Education Code 234.7)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.1 mandates that districts adopt policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on the actual or perceived characteristics set forth in Education Code 220 and Penal Code 422.55. Education Code 234.1 expressly includes immigration status among the protected categories. See BP 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities and BP 5145.3 - Nondiscrimination/Harassment for language fulfilling this mandate.
In accordance with law, Board Policy 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities, and Board Policy 5145.3 - Nondiscrimination/Harassment, no student shall be denied equal rights and opportunities, nor be subjected to unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying in the district's programs and activities on the basis of the student's or family's immigration status or for the refusal to provide information related to the student's or family's immigration status.  (Education Code 200, 220, 234.1)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 8310.3 prohibits districts from disclosing information about immigration status or religion for use in the compilation of a registry for immigration enforcement or otherwise assisting in the creation of such a registry. The 2024 Guidance contains a similar prohibition. Also see BP 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities and BP 5125 - Student Records.
Resources and data collected by the district shall not be used, directly or by others, to compile a list, registry, or database of individuals based on national origin, immigration status, religion, or other category of individual characteristics protected against unlawful discrimination.  (Government Code 8310.3)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 234.7, a district is required to notify parents/guardians of their children's right to a free public education regardless of immigration status. The 2024 Guidance provides additional detail on this topic, which includes one appendix titled "Know Your Educational Rights." Such notice may be included in the annual parental notification provided pursuant to Education Code 48980 or through any other cost-effective means. See 5145.6 - Parent/Guardian Notifications and BP 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians regarding their children's right to a free public education regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs and their rights related to immigration enforcement.  (Education Code 234.7)

The Superintendent or designee shall develop procedures for addressing any immigration-related requests by a law enforcement officer for access to district records, school sites, or students.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph reflects a recommendation from the 2024 Guidance and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee may provide training to staff regarding immigration issues, including information on responding to a request from a law enforcement officer to visit a school site or to have access to a student.

The Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board in a timely manner any requests for information or access to a school site by a law enforcement officer for the purpose of enforcing the immigration laws. Such notification shall be provided in a manner that ensures the confidentiality and privacy of any potentially identifying information.  (Education Code 234.7)
