## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that high-quality supplemental instruction can motivate and support students to attain grade-level academic standards, overcome academic deficiencies, and/or acquire critical skills. The District shall offer programs of direct, systematic, and intensive supplemental instruction to meet student needs. Supplemental instruction shall be offered in accordance with law and may be used to assist the District in meeting its goals for student achievement.

Supplemental instruction may be offered during and outside the regular school day, including during the summer, before school, after school, on Saturday, and/or during intersessions.  When supplemental instruction is offered during the regular school day, it shall not supplant the student's instruction in the core curriculum areas or physical education.

As appropriate, supplemental instruction may be provided through a classroom setting, individual or small group instruction, technology-based instruction, and/or an arrangement with a community or other external service provider.

When determined to be necessary by the principal or designee and when written parent/guardian consent is obtained for the student's participation, a student may be required to participate in supplemental instruction outside the regular school day.

Supplemental instruction shall be offered to students who are recommended for retention, or are identified as being at risk for retention, at their current grade level.  (Education Code 48070.5)

In addition, supplemental instruction may be offered to:


	Students who demonstrate academic deficiencies that may jeopardize their attainment of academic standards
	 
	High school students who need support to successfully complete courses required for graduation
