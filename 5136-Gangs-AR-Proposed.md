Prevention, Intervention, and Suppression Measures

The Superintendent or designee shall become informed of the gang history in the District and community, conduct assessments of current gang activity at the school sites, and document and follow up on gang-related incidents.

In order to discourage the influence of gangs, the following measures shall be implemented:


	Any student suspected of gang affiliation based on the display of behavior, gestures, apparel, or paraphernalia shall be referred to the principal or designee, and the following actions taken, as appropriate:
	 
	
		The student's parent/guardian shall be contacted and may be asked to meet with school staff in order to proactively address the concern and be included as part of the solution.
		 
		The student may be sent home to change clothes if necessary.
		 
		The student's behaviors and progress in school shall be documented, including attendance and grades.
		 
		 Intervention techniques such as mentoring, academic support, and a system of wraparound support service shall be implemented to help the student disengage from gang involvement.
		 
		Consistent and graduated discipline and accountability shall be implemented when appropriate and combined with positive support using conflict-resolution strategies and other restorative justice practices demonstrated to be effective with gang-involved youth.
		 
		Students shall be offered help in rejecting gang associations, including possible referral to community-based gang suppression and prevention organizations.
		 
		Law enforcement shall be notified if the student is suspected of being involved in gangs.
		 
	
	
	Any graffiti on school premises shall be removed, washed down, or painted over as soon as discovered. Graffiti shall be documented and photographed before it is removed.  These photographs shall be shared with local law enforcement authorities and used in future disciplinary or criminal action against the offenders. This information can also be used to determine whether a threat or incident is imminent.
	 
	Classroom and after-school programs may include gang prevention lessons that are taught jointly by teachers, counselors, law enforcement, and/or other organizations that are knowledgeable about gang prevention and shall:
	 
	
		Provide social and emotional learning designed to enhance individual self-esteem, provide positive reinforcement for acceptable behavior, and foster interest in a variety of constructive activities
		 
		Explain the dangers of gang membership
		 
		Provide counseling for targeted at-risk students
		 
		Include lessons or role-playing workshops in gang avoidance skills and nonviolent conflict resolution, including communication skills, anti-bullying, anger management, acceptance, and mediation skills
		 
		Assign individual gang members to cooperative learning groups in which they may work toward common goals with students who are not members of their gang
		 
		Provide school-to-career instruction
		 
		Provide positive interaction with local law enforcement
		 
	
	
	Staff shall actively promote membership in authorized school clubs and student organizations, sports and cultural activities and affiliations with the local community, and community service projects which can provide students companionship, safety, and a sense of purpose and belonging.

Parent/Guardian and Community Outreach

The Superintendent or designee may offer gang prevention classes or counseling for parents/guardians which may address the following topics:


	The reasons students join gangs
	 
	The dangers and consequences of gang membership
	 
	Warning signs which may indicate that students are at risk of becoming involved with gangs, including the use of social media for gang communication and promotion
	 
	The nature of local gang apparel and graffiti
	 
	Effective parenting techniques and planning family time
	​​​​​​​
	Conflict resolution techniques

In addition, the Superintendent or designee may offer community programs that address the scope and nature of local gang problems and strategies by which each segment of the community may alleviate gang problems.
