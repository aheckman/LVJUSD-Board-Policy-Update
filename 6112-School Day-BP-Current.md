## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. California law specifies the minimum length of the school day for elementary and secondary schools, which are reflected in the accompanying administrative regulation. In its, "Frequently Asked Questions," about attendance accounting and instructional time for independent study, the California Department of Education has clarified that the same minimum school day requirements apply to independent study as for students attending in-person instruction; for more information regarding instructional minutes as they relate to independent study, see BP/AR 6158 - Independent Study.
The Governing Board shall fix the length of the school day in accordance with law.  (Education Code 46100)

At each school, the length of the school day shall be the same for all students, except as otherwise permitted by law. For any student with a disability, the length of the school day shall be as specified in the student's individualized education program or Section 504 plan.

CSBA NOTE: The following two paragraphs are for use by districts that maintain any of grades K-6. Pursuant to Education Code 49056, as added by SB 291 (Ch. 863, Statutes of 2023) and amended by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), districts that maintain any of grades K-6 are required to provide recess as specified below, except that for any student with a disability, recess is required to be in accordance with the student's individualized education program or Section 504 plan. SB 153 clarifies that the recess requirements specified below do not apply to (1) students in grades 7-12, even if the school also serves students in grades K-6, or (2) students in grade 6 where grade 6 is part of a middle school program or part of a program that serves some or all of students in grades 6-12 if the students receive physical education as specified in Education Code 51222. For information regarding the prohibition against denying a student recess, see BP 5144 - Discipline.
Unless there is a field trip or other educational program, the daily schedule for grades K-6 shall include at least one or more periods of recess of at least 30 minutes on regular instructional days and 15 minutes on early release days. During this time, students shall be provided supervised opportunities, outdoors when weather and air quality permit unless space is not sufficient in which case recess may be held indoors, to engage in unstructured physical activity, play, organized games, and/or social engagement with peers, and may be provided a snack.  (Education Code 49056)

Educational Program means the entire school-sponsored offering for students, including in-class and out-of-class activities.  (Education Code 49056)

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this policy only applies to districts that maintain secondary schools and may be modified to reflect district practice.
In establishing the daily instructional schedule for each secondary school, the Superintendent or designee shall give consideration to course requirements and curricular demands, availability of school facilities and equipment, and applicable legal requirements.

The Board encourages flexibility in scheduling so as to provide longer time blocks or class periods when appropriate and desirable to support student learning, provide more intensive study of core academic subjects or extended exploration of complex topics, and reduce transition time between classes.

Prior to implementing a block or alternative schedule that will allow secondary students to attend school for fewer school days than the total number of school days for which the school is in session, the Board shall consult in good faith, in an effort to reach agreement with the certificated and classified employees of the school, parents/guardians of the students who would be affected by the change, and the community at large. Such consultation shall include at least one public hearing for which the Board shall give adequate notice to the employees and to the parents/guardians of affected students.  (Education Code 46162)
