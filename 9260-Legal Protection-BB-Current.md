Liability Insurance

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35208 requires the Governing Board to insure against the personal liability of Board members for death, personal injury, or damage/loss of property caused by a Board member's negligent act or omission when acting within the scope of the Board member's office. Districts may self-insure pursuant to Education Code 35214. See BP/AR 3530 - Risk Management/Insurance for additional information regarding district insurance requirements.
The Governing Board shall provide insurance necessary to protect Board members from liability caused by a negligent act or omission that occurs within the scope of the Board member's office in accordance with Education Code 35208.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 820.9, Board members are not vicariously liable for injuries caused by the district's acts or omissions. Additionally, in Caldwell v. Montoya, the California Supreme Court determined that Board members are immune from suits pursuant to Government Code 820.2 when performing "discretionary acts," such as basic governmental policy decisions, within the scope of their duties. Personal and/or criminal liability may exist, however, for injuries caused by the individual's own "wrongful" conduct, for some civil rights violations, or knowing violations of the Brown Act. See BB 9323.2 - Actions by the Board. Because the determination as to whether personal liability exists is dependent on the specific facts of each case, it is recommended that the district consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel if a question arises when making such a determination.
Protection Against Personal Liability

No Board member shall be liable for any harm caused by the Board member's negligent act or omission when acting within the scope of the Board member's responsibilities, including, but not limited to, Board responsibilities as specified in Board Bylaw 9000 - Role Of The Board. Additionally, no Board member shall be vicariously liable for injuries caused by the district's acts or omissions.  (Education Code 35208; Government Code 820.9)

In addition, no Board member shall be liable for any harm caused by the Board member's act or omission if the Board member was acting within the scope of the Board member's responsibilities, made in conformity with federal, state, and local laws, and made in furtherance of an effort to control, discipline, expel or suspend a student, or maintain order or control in the classroom or school.  (20 USC 7946)

This protection against liability shall not apply when:  (20 USC 7946)

	The Board member acted with willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, recklessness, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the harmed person's right to safety
	 
	The Board member caused harm by operating a motor vehicle
	 
	The Board member was not properly licensed, if required, by the State for such activities
	 
	The Board member was found by a court to have violated a federal or state civil rights law
	 
	The Board member was under the influence of alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct
	 
	The misconduct constituted a crime of violence pursuant to 18 USC 16 or an act of terrorism for which the Board member has been convicted in a court
	 
	The misconduct involved a sexual offense for which the Board member has been convicted in a court

Nothing in this Board bylaw is intended to protect a Board member from criminal or civil liability for injury caused by the Board member's own wrongful conduct, for certain violations of law, including the Brown Act, or for liability from the requirement to reimburse the district under certain circumstances as specified in law.  (Government Code 820.9, 825, 825.6, 54959, 54960)
