## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: With the establishment of the California Universal Meal Program pursuant to Education Code 49501.5, as amended by SB 348 (Ch. 600, Statutes of 2023), all public schools in California must make available, free of charge, one nutritionally adequate breakfast and one nutritionally adequate lunch each school day, to any student who requests a meal, regardless of the student's free or reduced-price meal eligibility status. To receive state reimbursement for the two meals, districts must participate in both the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program and comply with the requirement to have a written and clearly communicated meal charge policy as mandated pursuant to U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Memorandum SP 46-2016. However, some requirements of the National School Lunch Program and/or School Breakfast Program are no longer applicable.The California Department of Education's (CDE) Nutrition Services Division Management Bulletin SNP-04-2023 clarifies that districts that operate a non-pricing program such as the California Universal Meals Program, the Community Eligibility Program, or Provision 2 at all sites are not required to establish a meal charge policy because no students are charged for meals. However, if any school in the district charges for meals because it does not only operate a non-pricing program at all sites, the district is mandated to adopt and communicate a meal charge policy. In view of the potential conflict between the federal requirement and CDE guidance, it is recommended that districts adopt this administrative regulation and accompanying Board policy which addresses meal charges, even if the district operates a non-pricing program such as the California Universal Meals Program. Districts with questions about meal charge policies should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.The district may revise the following paragraphs accordingly.
Payments for Meals

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain a system for accurately recording payments received and tracking meals provided to each student.

At the beginning of the school year, the Superintendent or designee shall communicate the district's meal payment policies through multiple methods, including, but not limited to:

	Explaining the meal charge policy within registration materials provided to parents/guardians at the start of the school year
	 
	Including the policy in print versions of student handbooks, if provided to parents/guardians annually
	 
	Providing the policy whenever parents/guardians are notified regarding the application process for free and reduced-price meals, such as in the distribution of eligibility forms at the start of the school year
	 
	Posting the policy on the district's website

Reimbursement Claims

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49501.5, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), CDE is required to provide state meal reimbursement to districts that participate in, and meet the requirements of, the federal School Breakfast Program and National School Lunch Program, and any applicable state laws or regulations, for reduced-price and paid meals served to students. For additional information on California's Universal Meals Program, see BP/AR 3550 - Food Service/Child Nutrition Program and BP/AR 3553 - Free and Reduced Price Meals.To streamline administration of state and federal meal programs, CDE has developed an online Child Nutrition Information and Payment System which must be used to submit reimbursement claims and to submit and track the status of applications and USDA food requests.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records of the number of meals served each day by school site and by category of free and reduced-price meals. The Superintendent or designee shall submit reimbursement claims for school meals to the California Department of Education (CDE) using the online Child Nutrition Information and Payment System.

Minimizing Food Waste and Reducing Food Insecurity

The District shall take steps to minimize food waste and reduce food insecurity in district schools.  (Health and Safety Code 114079)

CSBA NOTE: Districts with an on-site food facility, such as a school cafeteria, are required to donate edible food that would otherwise be thrown away to a food recovery organization, unless the district demonstrates the existence of extraordinary circumstances beyond its control that makes such compliance impracticable. Additionally, pursuant to 14 CCR 18995.1 and 18995.4,  districts with an on-site food facility will be inspected by the governmental entity that provides solid waste collection services regarding its edible food recovery program and may be issued a Notice of Violation for noncompliance. If a Notice of Violation is issued, compliance is required within 60 days, unless extended by the enforcing agency because compliance is impracticable due to extenuating circumstances, as specified in 14 CCR 18991.3. For more information regarding organic waste reduction requirements, including a model edible food recovery agreement, see CalRecyle's, "Resources for Local Education Agencies: K-12 Public Schools and School Districts," available on its website. Also see BP/AR 3511.1 -- Integrated Waste Management for additional requirements related to waste diversion and recovery.
The Superintendent or designee shall arrange to recover the maximum amount of edible food that would otherwise be disposed for donation to a local food recovery organization.  (14 CCR 18991.3)

The district may also provide sharing tables where students and staff may return appropriate unused cafeteria food items to be made available to students during the course of a regular school meal time. If food on the sharing tables is not taken by a student, the school cafeteria may donate the food to a food bank or any other nonprofit charitable organization.  (Health and Safety Code 114079)

Food that may be donated includes prepackaged, nonpotentially hazardous food with the packaging still intact and in good condition, whole uncut produce that complies with Health and Safety Code 113992, unopened bags of sliced fruit, unopened containers of milk that are immediately stored in a cooling bin maintained at 41 degrees Fahrenheit or below, and perishable prepackaged food if it is placed in a proper temperature-controlled environment. The preparation, safety, and donation of food shall be consistent with Health and Safety Code 113980.  (Health and Safety Code 114079)

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records related to edible food recovery including a list of each food recovery service or organization that collects or receives the district's edible food, contact information for the service or organization, the types of food, frequency, and quantity that will be collected or hauled by the district, and a copy of contracts or written agreements between the district and food recovery services or organizations.  (14 CCR 18991.4)

Cafeteria Fund and Account

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 38093 authorizes the Governing Board to establish one or more cafeteria revolving accounts to be treated as revolving cash accounts of the cafeteria fund.
All proceeds from food sales and other services offered by the cafeteria shall be deposited in the cafeteria fund as provided by law.  (Education Code 38090, 38093)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 38101 permits a district, with approval from CDE, to utilize cafeteria funds to pay for the purchase of a mobile food facility. However, if the district uses federal reimbursements from any of the federal child nutrition programs for such purchase, the mobile food facility shall only be used to support the administration of those federal programs. Mobile food facilities used for any purposes other than to support the administration of federal child nutrition programs shall not be purchased with cafeteria funds.
The cafeteria fund shall be used only for those expenditures authorized by the Governing Board as necessary for the operation of school cafeterias in accordance with Education Code 38100-38103, 2 CFR Part 200 Appendix VII, and the California School Accounting Manual.

CSBA NOTE: By law, cafeteria funds may be used for the operation and improvement of school food services. For example, pursuant to Education Code 49550.5, districts may use cafeteria funds to supplement the cost of providing universal breakfast provided they submit the required certification to CDE.
The district may use cafeteria funds to supplement the provision of a nutritionally adequate breakfast and/or lunch to district students when permitted by law.

Any charges to, or transfers from, a food service program shall be dated and accompanied by a written explanation of the purpose of and basis for the expenditure.  (Education Code 38101)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. 2 CFR Part 200 Appendix VII, USDA's guidance, "SP 60-2016," and CDE's website, "Frequently Asked Questions about Indirect Costs," provide information regarding allowable indirect costs that may be charged to the nonprofit school food service account. Indirect costs are those that are incurred for the benefit of multiple programs or objectives and typically support administrative overhead functions (e.g., accounting, payroll, purchasing, utilities, janitorial services). Each program or objective that benefits from the indirect cost bears a commensurate portion of the cost. Costs may be charged to the nonprofit food service account only if properly documented.
Indirect costs charged to the food service program shall be based on either the district's prior year indirect cost rate as approved by CDE or the statewide average approved indirect cost rate for the second prior fiscal year, whichever is less.  (Education Code 38101)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 7 CFR 210.14 and 220.7, net cash resources (i.e., all monies that have accrued to the nonprofit school food service at any given time, less cash payable) should not exceed three months' average expenditures or such other amount as may be approved by CDE. If there is a surplus, then according to USDA's guidance, "Indirect Costs: Guidance for State Agencies and School Food Authorities," the district must lower the price of paid lunches, improve food quality, or make other improvements to school meal operations. CDE's Nutrition Services Division Management Bulletin SNP-04-2022 states that in an effort to provide flexibility to districts affected by various natural disasters and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, CDE has increased the excess net cash resources limitation to six months' average operating expenditures.
Net cash resources in the nonprofit school food service shall not exceed six months' average expenditures.  (7 CFR 210.14, 220.7)

U.S. Department of Agriculture Foods

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that participate in the National School Lunch Program and receive foods from USDA pursuant to 42 USC 1755 and 7 CFR 250.1-250.70. CDE is responsible for ordering and distributing USDA foods for use in California schools.
The district shall provide facilities for the storage and control of foods received through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that protect against theft, spoilage, damage, or other loss. Such storage facilities shall maintain donated foods in sanitary conditions, at the proper temperature and humidity, and with adequate air circulation. The district shall comply with all federal, state, or local requirements related to food safety and health and procedures for responding to a food recall, as applicable, and shall obtain all required health inspections.  (7 CFR 250.14)

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain inventories of USDA foods in accordance with 7 CFR 250.59 and CDE procedures, and shall ensure that foods are used before their expiration dates.

USDA donated foods shall be used in school lunches as far as practicable. USDA foods also may be used in other nonprofit food service activities, including, but not limited to, school breakfasts or other meals, a la carte foods sold to students, meals served to adults directly involved in the operation and administration of the food service and to other school staff, and training in nutrition, health, food service, or general home economics instruction for students, provided that any revenues from such activities accrue to the district's nonprofit food service account.  (7 CFR 250.59)

Contracts with Outside Services

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that contract for food service management services pursuant to Education Code 49554, 42 USC 1758, or 7 CFR 210.16 or consulting services pursuant to Education Code 45103.5, and should be modified to reflect the type(s) of contracts the district maintains; see the accompanying Board policy.Pursuant to CDE's Nutrition Services Division Management Bulletin SNP-05-2023, a district that participates in the School Nutrition Programs must obtain prior CDE approval for all food service management company Request for Proposals, Invitation for Bids, proposed contracts, contracts, and contract amendments. Districts currently using, or planning to use, the services of a food service management company must conduct a competitive procurement process. CDE suggests districts submit their bid solicitation documents in January, or at least 120 days prior to the anticipated contract execution date, whichever comes first. See AR 3311 - Bids for additional information on bidding requirements.
The term of any contract for food service management or consulting services shall not exceed one year. Any renewal of the contract or further requests for proposals to provide such services shall be considered on a year-to-year basis.  (Education Code 45103.5; 7 CFR 210.16)

Any contract for management of the food service operation shall be approved by CDE and comply with the conditions in Education Code 49554 and 7 CFR 210.16 as applicable. The district shall retain control of the quality, extent, and general nature of its food services.  (Education Code 49554; 42 USC 1758; 7 CFR 210.16)

Any contract for consulting services shall not result in the supervision of food service classified staff by the management consultant, nor shall it result in the elimination of any food service classified staff or position or have any adverse effect on the wages, benefits, or other terms and conditions of employment of classified food service staff or positions. All persons providing consulting services shall be subject to applicable employment conditions related to health and safety as listed in Education Code 45103.5.  (Education Code 45103.5)
