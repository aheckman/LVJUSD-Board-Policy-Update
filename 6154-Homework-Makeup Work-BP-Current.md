## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board recognizes that meaningful homework assignments can be a valuable extension of student learning time, provide enrichment, and assist students in developing good study habits. Homework and/or makeup work shall be assigned when necessary to support classroom lessons, enable students to complete unfinished assignments, or review and apply academic content for better understanding.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph addresses student use of technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), in relation to homework and makeup work, and may be modified to reflect district practice. The U.S. Department of Education Office of Educational Technology's, "Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Teaching and Learning: Insights and Recommendations," provides information related to the opportunities for using AI to improve education, the challenges in doing so, and recommendations to guide further policy development. For more information regarding prohibited and permitted student use of technology, see BP 5131.9 - Academic Honesty and BP 6163.4 - Student Use of Technology.
Students may use technology to assist with homework and/or makeup work in conducting research, correcting grammar and spelling, and learning from educational applications such as tutoring systems and language learning applications, as specified in Board Policy 5131.9 - Academic Honesty and Board Policy 6163.4 - Student Use of Technology.

The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with school administrators and teachers to develop and regularly review guidelines for the assignment of homework and the related responsibilities of students, staff, and parents/guardians.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to specify the average number of minutes of homework that may be expected per day at each grade level, or the district may adopt an administrative regulation that contains such guidelines.
Homework assignments shall be reasonable in length and appropriate to the grade level and course. The Board expects that the number, frequency, and degree of difficulty of homework assignments will increase with the grade level and the maturity of students. Teachers shall assign homework only as necessary to fulfill academic goals and reinforce current instruction.

As needed, teachers may receive training in designing relevant homework assignments that reinforce classroom learning objectives and inspire students' interests.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
Although on-time completion of homework is important to maintain academic progress, the Board recognizes that students learn at different rates. Students shall receive credit for work that is completed late in order to encourage their continued learning.

Age-appropriate instruction may be given to help students allocate their time wisely, meet their deadlines, learn to work independently, and develop good personal study habits.

At the beginning of the school year, teachers shall communicate homework expectations to students and their parents/guardians. Homework guidelines shall also be included in student and/or parent/guardian handbooks. These communications shall include the manner in which homework relates to achievement of academic standards and course content, the impact of homework assignments on students' grades, any school resources and programs that are available to provide homework support, and ways in which parents/guardians may appropriately assist their children.

Although it is the student's responsibility to undertake assignments independently, parents/guardians may serve as a resource and are encouraged to ensure that their child's homework assignments are completed. Students may also work with other students and use approved outside resources as directed by the teacher.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph should be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 8482.3, programs operated under the After School Education and Safety Program (Education Code 8482-8484.65), the federal 21st Century Community Learning Center program (Education Code 8484.7-8484.9; 20 USC 7171-7176), and/or the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (Education Code 46120) are required to include an educational and literacy component in which tutoring or homework assistance is provided in language arts, mathematics, history-social science, computer training, and/or science. If the district offers a before-school or after-school program under the 21st Century High School After School Safety and Enrichment for Teens program for grades 9-12 (Education Code 8420-8428; 20 USC 7171-7176), the program must include an academic assistance program, which may include homework assistance. See AR 5148.2 - Before/After School Programs. In addition, some districts offer a supervised study hall elective which high school students can take instead of other electives.
To further support students' homework efforts, the Superintendent or designee may establish and maintain electronic forums, provide access to school library media centers and technological resources, and/or provide before-school and after-school programs where students can receive homework assistance from teachers, volunteers, and/or student tutors. The Board encourages the Superintendent or designee to design class and transportation schedules that will enable students to make use of homework support services.

Teachers shall review all completed homework to assess the student's understanding of academic content and shall provide timely feedback to the student.

If a student repeatedly fails to complete homework, the teacher shall notify the student's parents/guardians as soon as possible so that corrective action can be taken prior to the release of any final grades or report cards.

Makeup Work

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48205, students who miss schoolwork because of an excused absence must be given full credit for makeup work satisfactorily completed within a reasonable period of time. State law does not require districts to give full credit for makeup work following an unexcused absence. However, CSBA's governance brief, "Research-Supported Strategies to Improve the Accuracy and Fairness of Grades," recommends that student absence be dealt with separately from determining students' academic understanding and progress. Thus, the following paragraph provides for full credit to be awarded for satisfactory completion of makeup work regardless of the reason for the absence, an approach which is consistent with BP/AR 5121 - Grades/Evaluation for Student Achievement. Also see BP/AR 5113.1 - Chronic Absence and Truancy for strategies to address excessive excused and/or unexcused absences. The district may revise the following paragraph to reflect district practice, provided that it ensures compliance with Education Code 48205.
Students who are absent from school shall be given the opportunity to complete all assignments and tests that can be reasonably provided. As determined by the teacher, the assignments and tests shall be equivalent to, but not necessarily identical to, the assignments and tests missed during the absence. Students shall receive full credit for work satisfactorily completed within a reasonable period of time.

The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians that no student may have a grade reduced or lose academic credit for any excused absence when missed assignments and tests are satisfactorily completed within a reasonable period of time. Such notification shall include the full text of Education Code 48205.  (Education Code 48980)

Suspended Students

When a parent/guardian of a student who has been suspended for two or more school days requests homework that the student would otherwise have been assigned, the student's teacher shall provide such homework. If a homework assignment is requested and is turned in to the teacher by the student either upon the student's return from suspension or within the timeframe originally prescribed by the teacher, whichever is later, and is not graded before the end of the academic term, the homework assignment shall not be included in the calculation of the student's overall grade in the class.  (Education Code 48913.5)

The teacher of any class from which a student is suspended may require the student to complete any assignments and tests missed during the suspension.  (Education Code 48913)

If a homework assignment is requested and is turned in to the teacher by the student either upon the student&#39;s return from suspension or within the timeframe originally prescribed by the teacher, whichever is later, and is not graded before the end of the academic term, the homework assignment shall not be included in the calculation of the student&#39;s overall grade in the class. &nbsp;(Education Code 48913.5)<br>

The teacher of any class from which a student is suspended may require the student to complete any assignments and tests missed during the suspension. &nbsp;(Education Code 48913)</body>
