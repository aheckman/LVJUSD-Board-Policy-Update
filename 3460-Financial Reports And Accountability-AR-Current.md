## Policy Content

Interim Reports

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42130 requires that the district issue two interim reports; see the accompanying Board policy for information about the use of these reports to certify whether the district will be able to meet its fiscal obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year and, based on current forecasts, for the two subsequent fiscal years.
Each interim report developed pursuant to Education Code 42130 shall include an assessment of the district budget as revised to reflect current information regarding the adopted state budget, district property tax revenues, if any, and ending balances for the preceding fiscal year.  (Education Code 42130, 42131)

CSBA NOTE: Interim reports must be based on the criteria and standards adopted by the State Board of Education (SBE) pursuant to Education Code 33127. These criteria and standards are specified in 5 CCR 15453-15464 and address the areas listed below.
Interim reports shall be based on State Board of Education criteria and standards which address fund and cash balances, reserves, deficit spending, estimation of average daily attendance (ADA), projected enrollment, ratio of ADA to enrollment, projected local control funding formula (LCFF) revenue, salaries and benefits, other revenues and expenditures, and facilities maintenance. For purposes of assessing projections of LCFF revenue, the first interim report shall be compared to the adopted district budget and the second interim report shall be compared to the projections in the first interim report.  (Education Code 42130; 5 CCR 15453-15464)

An interim report shall also provide supplemental information regarding contingent liabilities, use of one-time revenues for ongoing expenditures, contingent revenues, contributions (i.e., projected contributions from unrestricted general fund resources to restricted general fund resources, projected transfers to or from the general fund to cover operating deficits in the general fund or any other fund, and capital project cost overruns that may impact the general fund budget), long-term commitments, unfunded liabilities, temporary interfund borrowings, the status of labor agreements, and the status of other funds.  (Education Code 42130; 5 CCR 15453, 15464)

Audit Report

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 41020, each year the district is required to arrange for an independent audit of all the district's funds. The audit must be approved by the Governing Board and submitted to the County Superintendent of Schools, California Department of Education (CDE), and State Controller within specified timelines. See the accompanying Board policy.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish a timetable for the completion and review of the annual audit within the deadlines established by law.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 34 contains requirements for the contents of the district's annual audited financial reports.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide the necessary financial records and cooperate with the independent auditor selected by the Governing Board to ensure that the audit report contains all information required by law and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 41020, the audit must include an audit of income and expenditures for all district funds, as provided below. Additionally, Education Code 41020 requires that the audit include a determination of whether funds were expended in accordance with the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP). Pursuant to Education Code 52061 and 52064, the annual update to the LCAP must list expenditures for specific actions to be taken to achieve the goals in the LCAP, including expenditures for services to students who are English learners, redesignated as fluent English proficient, foster youth, and/or eligible for free and reduced-price meals. See BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan for requirements pertaining to the LCAP.
The district audit shall include all income and expenditures by source of funds, including the student body and cafeteria funds and accounts, state and federal grant funds, and any other funds under the district's control or jurisdiction, as well as an audit of student attendance procedures. The audit shall also include a determination of whether LCFF funds were expended in accordance with the district's local control and accountability plan or an approved annual update of the plan.  (Education Code 41020)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that elect to participate in the school district of choice program (Education Code 48300-48316); see BP/AR 5117 - Interdistrict Attendance. Pursuant to Education Code 48301, any district that elects to participate in the school district of choice program must ensure that its annual financial audit includes a review of the district's compliance with specified program requirements, including the establishment of a random, unbiased process for student admittance and the provision of appropriate and factually accurate parent/guardian communications.
If the district participates in the school district of choice program to accept interdistrict transfers, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the auditor, prior to the commencement of the audit, that the audit must include a review of the district's compliance with specified program requirements.  (Education Code 48301)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 41344 and 41344.1, the district may appeal to the Education Audit Appeals Panel (EAAP) when an audit finding requires the district to repay an apportionment or pay a penalty. If the EAAP finds that there has been substantial compliance with the law, it may waive or reduce repayments or order other remedial measures to induce future compliance.
If an audit finding results in the district being required to repay an apportionment or pay a penalty, the district may appeal the finding to the Education Audit Appeals Panel by making an informal summary appeal within 30 days of receiving the final audit report or initiating a formal appeal within 60 days of receiving the report.  (Education Code 41344, 41344.1)

While a public accounting firm is performing the audit of the district, it shall not provide any nonauditing, management, or other consulting services for the district except as provided in Government Auditing Standards, Amendment #3, published by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.  (Education Code 41020)

Report on Expenditures of State Facilities Funds

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 41024, districts that receive state facilities funding pursuant to the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act (Education Code 17070.10-17079.30) must annually report a detailed list of all expenditures of state funds, including interest, and of the district's matching funds for completed projects. Education Code 41024 requires that an audit of completed facilities projects be submitted within one year of project completion.Education Code 41024 requires the auditor to file the audit of state facilities funds with the State Controller within 60 days of completion of the audit. The State Controller, within 60 days of the receipt of the certified audit and after determining that the audit conforms with reporting standards in the audit guide, is then required to provide a copy of the audit to CDE and the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), and to notify OPSC of any audit findings required pursuant to Education Code 41024 and of any amounts or adjustments identified on the basis of district's failure to expend the funds in accordance with the School Facilities Act or any accompanying grant agreement signed by district. The district may appeal any finding in accordance with the timelines and process specified in Education Code 41344. However, certain adjustments specified in Education Code 41024 (b)(1)(C)-(G) are not appealable to the EAAP.
When the district participates in the school facilities program pursuant to Education Code 17070.10-17079.30, the Superintendent or designee shall annually report a detailed list of all expenditures of state facilities funds, including interest, and of the district's matching funds for completed projects until all such funds are expended. The report shall identify expenditures on a project-by-project basis, reflect completed projects that were reimbursed within that fiscal year, and clearly indicate the list of projects that have been completed.  (Education Code 41024; 2 CCR 1859.104)

Audits of facilities projects shall be concluded within one year of project completion and shall be included as part of the district's audit for the fiscal year in which the project is reported as completed.  A project shall be deemed completed when any of the following conditions is met:  (Education Code 41024; 2 CCR 1859.104)

	When the notice of completion for the project has been filed, all outstanding invoices, claims, and change orders have been satisfied, and the facility is currently in use by the district
	 
	Three years from the date of the final fund release for an elementary school project
	 
	Four years from the date of the final fund release for a middle or high school project

Fund Balance

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section reflects GASB Statement 54, which addresses the manner in which fund balances in the general fund must be reported in external financial reports. Pursuant to GASB 54, the Board has sole authority to specify purposes of committed funds (Item #3 below) and also must express, or delegate the authority to express, intended purposes of resources resulting in the assigned fund balance (Item #4 below); see BP 3100 - Budget.
In accordance with GASB Statement 54, external financial reports shall report fund balances in the general fund within the following classifications based on the relative strength of constraints placed on the purposes for which resources can be used:

	Nonspendable fund balance, including amounts that are not expected to be converted to cash, such as resources that are not in a spendable form or are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact
	 
	Restricted fund balance, including amounts constrained to specific purposes by their providers or by law
	 
	Committed fund balance, including amounts constrained to specific purposes by the Board
	 
	Assigned fund balance, including amounts which the Board or its designee intends to use for a specific purpose
	 
	Unassigned fund balance, including amounts that are available for any purpose

Negative Balance Report

CSBA NOTE: When applicable, Education Code 42127.5 requires districts to report the reasons for a negative unrestricted fund balance or negative cash balance. "Unrestricted funds" are any funds that are not constrained by law to be spent on specific purposes and which therefore may be spent as the Board deems appropriate. Such funds may be reported in the committed fund balance, assigned fund balance, or unassigned fund balance as provided in Items #3-5 in the section "Fund Balance" above.
Whenever the district reports a negative unrestricted fund balance or a negative cash balance in its annual budget or annual audit report, it shall include in the budget a statement that identifies the reasons for the negative unrestricted fund balance or negative cash balance and the steps that have been taken to ensure that the negative balance will not occur at the end of the current fiscal year.  (Education Code 42127.5)

Lease Accounting

CSBA NOTE: To increase the usefulness of government financial statements, GASB has issued GASB Statement 87, which defines a lease as a "contract that conveys control of the right to use another entity's nonfinancial asset (the underlying asset) as specified in the contract for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction," and changes the rules related to the recognition, measurement, and related disclosures of leases involving governmental entities. Examples of "nonfinancial assets" include buildings, land, vehicles, and equipment.
Any lease agreement involving the district, whether as lessor or lessee, shall be classified as a short-term lease, a contract that transfers ownership, or a lease other than short-term lease and contract that transfers ownership. District financial statement disclosures and schedules related to any lease shall comply with the standards specified in GASB 87.

Non-Voter-Approved Debt Report

CSBA NOTE: The following section addresses notices regarding the issuance of revenue bonds, certificates of participation, and other non-voter-approved debts. Pursuant to Education Code 17150 and 17150.1, the County Superintendent and county auditor may, within 15 days of receiving these notices from the district, comment publicly to the Board regarding the capability of the district to repay the debt obligation.Pursuant to Education Code 42133, a district that has a qualified or negative certification in any fiscal year cannot issue non-voter-approved debt in that fiscal year or in the next fiscal year unless the County Superintendent determines that the district's repayment of the debt is probable.
Upon approval by the Board to proceed with the issuance of revenue bonds or any agreement for financing school construction pursuant to Education Code 17170-17199.5, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the County Superintendent of Schools and the county auditor. The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board, the county auditor, the County Superintendent, and the public with related repayment schedules and evidence of the district's ability to repay the obligation.  (Education Code 17150)

When the Board is considering the issuance of certificates of participation and other debt instruments that are secured by real property and do not require the approval of the voters of the district, the Superintendent or designee shall provide notice to the County Superintendent and county auditor no later than 30 days before the Board's approval to proceed with issuance. The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board, the county auditor, the County Superintendent, and the public with information necessary to assess the anticipated effect of the debt issuance, including related repayment schedules, evidence of the district's ability to repay the obligation, and the issuance costs.  (Education Code 17150.1)

Other Postemployment Benefits Report

CSBA NOTE: The following section reflects GASB Statement 75, which contains reporting requirements pertaining to "other postemployment benefits" (OPEBs) (i.e., medical, dental, vision, hearing, death benefits, life insurance, long-term care, long-term disability, and other nonpension benefits for retired employees). Under GASB 75, districts that do not provide OPEB through a trust, (i.e., OPEBs that are not prefunded), are required to report the total unfunded liability, as calculated in the most recent actuary report, in the district's financial statements. The decision of whether to prefund the benefits, and by how much, is at the Board's discretion; see BP 3100 - Budget.The SBE's criteria and standards for budget adoption (5 CCR 15440-15451) require districts to estimate unfunded OPEBs as well as the unfunded portion of any self-insured benefits program. Changes to the unfunded liabilities are disclosed at interim reporting periods pursuant to 5 CCR 15453 and 15464. These reports are included in the state's standardized account code structure software used to develop budget and interim reports.CSBA's OPEB Solutions Program provides access to qualified actuaries and consultants and a GASB 75-compliant trust to prefund future obligations. See CSBA's website for further information.The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice and should be deleted by districts that do not provide OPEBs.
In accordance with GASB Statement 75, the district's financial statements shall report the expense of nonpension other postemployment benefits (OPEBs) on an accrual basis over retirees' active working lifetime, as determined by a qualified actuary procured by the Superintendent or designee. To the extent that these OPEBs are not prefunded, the district shall report a liability on its financial statements.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually present the estimated accrued but unfunded cost of OPEBs and the actuarial report upon which those costs are based at an open meeting of the Board.  (Education Code 42140)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to GASB 75, the district must arrange for an actuary to update the valuation of its OPEB obligations every two years. However, GASB 75 includes an option for the use of a specified alternative method in lieu of an actuarial valuation for purposes of determining the total OPEB liability for benefits provided through an OPEB plan with fewer than 100 members. Such districts may modify the following paragraph to reflect district practice.
The district's financial obligation for OPEBs shall be reevaluated every two years in accordance with GASB 75.

Workers' Compensation Claims Report

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that are self-insured for workers' compensation claims, either individually or as part of a joint powers agency. See BP 3100 - Budget for provisions related to funding the estimated accrued cost of workers' compensation claims.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually provide the Board, at a public meeting, information and related actuarial reports showing the estimated accrued but unfunded cost of workers' compensation claims. The estimate of costs shall be based on an actuarial report completed at least every three years by a qualified actuary.  (Education Code 42141)

<strong>Other Postemployment Benefits Report</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='gMA157' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The following section reflects GASB Statement 75, which contains reporting requirements pertaining to "other postemployment benefits" (OPEBs) (i.e., medical, dental, vision, hearing, death benefits, life insurance, long-term care, long-term disability, and other nonpension benefits for retired employees). Under GASB 75, districts that do not provide OPEB through a trust, (i.e., OPEBs that are not prefunded), are required to report the total unfunded liability, as calculated in the most recent actuary report, in the district's financial statements. The decision of whether to prefund the benefits, and by how much, is at the Board's discretion; see BP 3100 - Budget.<br><br>The SBE's criteria and standards for budget adoption (5 CCR 15440-15451) require districts to estimate unfunded OPEBs as well as the unfunded portion of any self-insured benefits program. Changes to the unfunded liabilities are disclosed at interim reporting periods pursuant to 5 CCR 15453 and 15464. These reports are included in the state's standardized account code structure software used to develop budget and interim reports.<br><br>CSBA's OPEB Solutions Program provides access to qualified actuaries and consultants and a GASB 75-compliant trust to prefund future obligations. See CSBA's website for further information.<br><br>The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice and should be deleted by districts that do not provide OPEBs.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="EOTcMg12" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22EOTcMg12%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22gMA157%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1695072526%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20following%20section%20reflects%20GASB%20Statement%2075%2C%20which%20contains%20reporting%20requirements%20pertaining%20to%20%5C%22other%20postemployment%20benefits%5C%22%20%28OPEBs%29%20%28i.e.%2C%20medical%2C%20dental%2C%20vision%2C%20hearing%2C%20death%20benefits%2C%20life%20insurance%2C%20long-term%20care%2C%20long-term%20disability%2C%20and%20other%20nonpension%20benefits%20for%20retired%20employees%29.%20Under%20GASB%2075%2C%20districts%20that%20do%20not%20provide%20OPEB%20through%20a%20trust%2C%20%28i.e.%2C%20OPEBs%20that%20are%20not%20prefunded%29%2C%20are%20required%20to%20report%20the%20total%20unfunded%20liability%2C%20as%20calculated%20in%20the%20most%20recent%20actuary%20report%2C%20in%20the%20district%27s%20financial%20statements.%20The%20decision%20of%20whether%20to%20prefund%20the%20benefits%2C%20and%20by%20how%20much%2C%20is%20at%20the%20Board%27s%20discretion%3B%20see%20BP%203100%20-%20Budget.%5Cn%5CnThe%20SBE%27s%20criteria%20and%20standards%20for%20budget%20adoption%20%285%20CCR%2015440-15451%29%20require%20districts%20to%20estimate%20unfunded%20OPEBs%20as%20well%20as%20the%20unfunded%20portion%20of%20any%20self-insured%20benefits%20program.%20Changes%20to%20the%20unfunded%20liabilities%20are%20disclosed%20at%20interim%20reporting%20periods%20pursuant%20to%205%20CCR%2015453%20and%2015464.%20These%20reports%20are%20included%20in%20the%20state%27s%20standardized%20account%20code%20structure%20software%20used%20to%20develop%20budget%20and%20interim%20reports.%5Cn%5CnCSBA%27s%20OPEB%20Solutions%20Program%20provides%20access%20to%20qualified%20actuaries%20and%20consultants%20and%20a%20GASB%2075-compliant%20trust%20to%20prefund%20future%20obligations.%20See%20CSBA%27s%20website%20for%20further%20information.%5Cn%5CnThe%20following%20optional%20section%20may%20be%20revised%20to%20reflect%20district%20practice%20and%20should%20be%20deleted%20by%20districts%20that%20do%20not%20provide%20OPEBs.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-EOTcMg12" title="CSBA NOTE: The following section reflects GASB Sta..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
