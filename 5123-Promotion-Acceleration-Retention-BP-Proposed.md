## Policy Content

​​​​The Board of Education expects students to progress through each grade level within one school year. Toward this end, instruction shall be designed to accommodate the variety of ways that students learn and provide strategies for addressing academic deficiencies as needed.
Students shall progress through the grade levels by demonstrating growth in learning and meeting grade-level standards of expected student achievement.

When high academic achievement is evident, the teacher may recommend a student for acceleration to a higher grade level. The student's maturity level shall be taken into consideration in making a determination to accelerate a student.

Teachers shall identify students who should be retained or who are at risk of being retained at their current grade level as early as possible in the school year and as early in their school careers as practicable. Such students shall be identified at the following grade levels: (Education Code 48070.5)


	Between grades Kindergarten and 1
	 
	Between grades 1 and 2
	 
	Between grades 2 and 3
	 
	Between grades 3 and 4
	 
	Between grades 4 and 5
	 
	Between the end of the intermediate grades and the beginning of the middle school grades
	 
	Between the end of the middle school grades and the beginning of the high school grades


Students shall be identified for retention on the basis of failure to meet minimum levels of proficiency, as indicated by grades and the following additional indicators of academic achievement:


	State Academic Assessment
	 
	District Assessments
	 
	Attendance
	 
	Social/Emotional development


Students between grades 2 and 3 and grades 3 and 4 shall be identified primarily on the basis of their level of proficiency in reading. Proficiency in reading, English language arts, and mathematics shall be the basis for identifying students between grades 4 and 5, between intermediate and middle school grades, and between middle school grades and high school grades. (Education Code 48070.5)

If a student does not have a single regular classroom teacher, the Superintendent or designee shall specify the teacher(s) responsible for the decision to promote or retain the student. (Education Code 48070.5)

The teacher's decision to promote or retain a student may be appealed in accordance with AR 5123 - Promotion/Acceleration/Retention.

When a student is recommended for retention or is identified as being at risk for retention, the Superintendent or designee shall offer an appropriate program of remedial instruction to assist the student in meeting grade-level expectations. (Education Code 48070.5)
