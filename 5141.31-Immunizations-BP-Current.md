## Policy Content

To protect the health of all students and staff and to curtail the spread of infectious diseases, the Governing Board shall cooperate with state and local public health agencies to encourage and facilitate immunization of all district students against preventable diseases.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph should be revised to reflect the grade levels and programs offered by the district.
Each student enrolling for the first time in a district school, preschool, or child care and development program or enrolling in or advancing to grade 7 shall present an immunization record from any authorized private or public health care provider certifying that the student has received all required immunizations in accordance with law.  Students shall be excluded from school or exempted from immunization requirements only as allowed by law.

CSBA NOTE: 17 CCR 6035 allows a student transferring from another school in the United States to be conditionally admitted for up to 30 school days while waiting for the transfer of immunization records from the student's previous school; see the accompanying administrative regulation. However, the California Department of Public Health's California Immunization Handbook for Pre-kindergarten (Child Care) Programs and Schools recommends that schools request parents/guardians to bring their child's personal immunization record from the child's health care provider to registration, rather than waiting for the cumulative file.Pursuant to 42 USC 11431 and Education Code 48853.5, homeless children and foster youth must be immediately enrolled even if they are unable to produce records normally required for enrollment, including medical records.  See AR 6173 - Education for Homeless Children and AR 6173.1- Education for Foster Youth. In addition, pursuant to Education Code 49701, children of military families must be allowed 30 days from the date of enrollment to obtain required immunizations; see AR 6173.2 - Education of Children of Military Families. These exceptions are also addressed in the accompanying administrative regulation.
Transfer students shall be requested to present immunization records upon registration at district schools if possible.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that permit medical personnel to administer immunizations at school as authorized by Education Code 49403. Pursuant to Education Code 49403, immunizations may be provided by a licensed physician or, if acting under the direction of a supervising physician, a registered nurse (including a school nurse), physician assistant, nurse practitioner, licensed vocational nurse, or nursing student acting under the supervision of a registered nurse. The authority of any health care practitioner, other than a licensed physician, to administer immunizations in a school immunization program is limited to immunizations for annual seasonal influenza, influenza pandemic episodes, and other diseases that represent a current or potential outbreak as declared by a federal, state, or local public health officer.  Whenever a health care provider is authorized to administer immunizations at school, the school nurse must be notified and must maintain control, as necessary, as the supervisor of health in accordance with Education Code 44871 and other statutes.
The Superintendent or designee may arrange for an authorized health care provider to administer immunizations at school to any student whose parent/guardian has consented in writing.  At the beginning of the school year, parents/guardians shall be notified of their right to provide consent for the administration of an immunization to their child at school.   (Education Code 48980, 49403)
