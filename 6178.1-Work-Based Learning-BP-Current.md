## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts maintaining middle and/or high schools and should be revised to reflect district practice. Under the state plan for career technical education (CTE), each district receiving funds under the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (20 USC 2301-2414) is required to include specified components in its CTE program, including practical application and experience through actual or simulated work-based learning assignments. Other districts may offer work-based learning opportunities at their discretion. Also see BP/AR 6178 - Career Technical Education. 
The Governing Board desires to facilitate work-based learning opportunities which link classroom learning with real-world experiences. The district's work-based learning program shall be designed to teach students the skills, attitudes, and knowledge necessary for successful employment and to reinforce mastery of both academic and career technical education (CTE) standards.

CSBA NOTE: The following list should be revised to reflect the program(s) offered by the district. Education Code 51760.1 authorizes districts, county offices of education, regional occupational centers/programs, and partnership academies to provide work-based learning opportunities which may include, but are not limited to, work experience education (WEE), community classrooms or cooperative CTE programs, and job shadowing experiences, as described in items #1-3 below. See the accompanying administrative regulation for legal requirements pertaining to these programs. In addition, although not specified in state law, items #4-8 below provide other examples of work-based learning opportunities cited in the state's CTE curriculum framework and the California Department of Education (CDE) publication Multiple Pathways to Student Success: Envisioning the New California High School, available on WestEd's web site. 
The district's work-based learning program may offer opportunities for paid and/or unpaid work experiences, including, but not limited to:

	Work experience education as defined in Education Code 51764
	 
	Cooperative CTE or community classrooms as defined in Education Code 52372.1
	 
	Job shadowing experience as defined in Education Code 51769
	 
	Student internships
	 
	Apprenticeships
	 
	Service learning
	 
	Employment in social/civic or school-based enterprises
	 
	Technology-based or other simulated work experiences

The Superintendent or designee may provide students employment opportunities with public and private employers in areas within or outside the district, including in any contiguous state. (Education Code 51768)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. 
The Board may elect to pay wages to students participating in a work-based learning program, but shall not make payments to or for private employers except for students with disabilities who are participating in work experience education programs funded by the state for such students. (Education Code 51768)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 10070, the district is required to submit a secondary district plan to the CDE along with its WEE program application. 5 CCR 10070 also requires the district to submit evidence that the Governing Board has approved the district plan (e.g., meeting minutes). The following paragraph ensures the Board's involvement when any work-based learning program requires CDE or other state agency approval. 
Any district plan for work-based learning shall be submitted to the Board for approval. When required, the plan shall be submitted to the California Department of Education or other state agency or official.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 51760.1 encourages districts to work with any local workforce investment board youth councils and workforce investment boards established by Education Code 51760.2 to coordinate work-based learning opportunities and facilitate regional planning. 
The Superintendent or designee shall involve local businesses or business organizations in planning and implementing work-based learning opportunities that support the district's vision and goals for student learning and local workforce development efforts.  He/she also may work with postsecondary institutions, community organizations, and others to identify opportunities for work-based learning.

CSBA NOTE: Districts that offer WEE programs are required by 5 CCR 10070-10071 to develop a written training agreement with each employer with specified components and assurances. 5 CCR 10087 and 10108 require the development of a training agreement and individual student training plans for community classrooms and cooperative CTE programs. Districts that do not offer these specific programs may delete or revise the following paragraph. 
When required by law, the Superintendent or designee shall develop a written training agreement with the employer that describes the conditions and requirements to be met by all parties and shall develop an individual training plan for each student which outlines the objectives or competencies that the student is expected to accomplish at the work site.  (5 CCR 10070-10071, 10087, 10108)

To ensure appropriate guidance and supervision of participating students and maximize the educational benefit from placement in any work-based learning program, district staff shall coordinate with the workplace supervisors or mentors.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49160 prohibits any person, firm, or corporation from employing a minor under age 18 without a work permit issued by the proper education authority, with specified exceptions. See BP/AR 5113.2 - Work Permits. Work permits are not required for unpaid work-based learning opportunities. Districts that offer only unpaid programs should delete the following paragraph. 
A minor student shall be allowed employment through a paid work-based learning program only if he/she has been issued a work permit, in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation. (Education Code 49113, 49160)

All laws or rules applicable to minors in employment relationships shall be applicable to students enrolled in work-based learning programs.  (Education Code 51763)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. According to the CDE's Work Experience Education Guide, students participating in a paid work-based learning program must be covered by their employer for workers' compensation insurance pursuant to Education Code 51769. Students participating in an unpaid work-based learning program must be covered by the district's insurance, unless the employer elects to provide such coverage. In addition, Education Code 35208 requires districts to insure against liability. Pursuant to Education Code 51760, the Board may choose to purchase liability insurance for students participating in work-based learning programs off school grounds or may require such students to purchase insurance and pass on all or a portion of the costs to the district, at the discretion of the Board. 
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any student participating in a work-based learning program off school grounds is covered under the employer's or district's insurance, as applicable, in the event the student is injured.

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 10075 requires a WEE teacher-coordinator to possess a valid preliminary, professional clear, or life credential or other nonintern teaching credential that authorizes the teacher to teach in California K-12 schools. Pursuant to 5 CCR 10080 and 10100, teachers of community classrooms and cooperative CTE programs must be certificated CTE teachers. 
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any teacher-coordinator of a work-based learning program possesses the appropriate credential issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.  (5 CCR 10075, 10080, 10100)

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records related to each student's participation in the district's work-based learning program, including, but not limited to, the student's individualized training plan, employment hours and job site, work permit if applicable, the employer's report of student's attendance and job performance, the teacher-coordinator's consultations and observations, and reports of the student's grade and credits earned.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect indicators agreed upon by the Board and Superintendent for evaluating program effectiveness.
The Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Board regarding program implementation and effectiveness, including, but not limited to, rates of student participation in work-based learning programs and assessment results of participating students.
