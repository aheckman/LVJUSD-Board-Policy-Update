## Policy Content

Use of Animals for Instructional Purposes

Before any student or employee brings an animal to school for an instructional purpose, they shall receive written permission from the principal or designee. The principal or designee shall give such permission only after he/she has provided written notification to all parents/guardians of students in the affected class, asking them to verify whether their child has any known allergies, asthma, or other health condition that may be aggravated by the animal's presence. When a parent/guardian has provided notification that their child has an allergy, asthma, or other health condition that may be aggravated by the animal, the principal shall take appropriate measures to protect the student from exposure to the animal.

All animals brought to school must be in good physical condition and must be appropriately immunized. The teacher shall ensure that the species of animal is appropriate for the instructional purpose and age and maturity of the students.

All animals brought to school shall be adequately fed, effectively controlled, humanely treated, and properly housed in cages or containers suitable for the species. The teacher shall ensure that cages and containers are cleaned regularly and that waste materials are removed and disposed of in an appropriate manner.

The teacher shall ensure that students receive instructions regarding the proper handling of and personal hygiene around animals.

Except for service animals, as defined below, all animals are prohibited on school transportation services. (Education Code 39839; 13 CCR 1216)

Use of Emotional Support Dogs

Any emotional support dog visiting a District facility must follow the guidelines noted above in section "Use of Animals for Instructional Purposes." 

In addition, emotional support dog interactions must take place in designated areas approved by site administration.  If indoors, a blanket or mat must be provided.  The area must be sanitized following each visit to an indoor space. Emotional support dogs are not permitted inside any other District facilities.  

Liability Insurance Requirements for Emotional Support Dogs

Emotional support dog handlers and community organizations must meet specific insurance coverage requirements to protect the District and its students:


	General Liability: $1 million per occurrence / $2 million aggregate minimum
	 
	Property Damage Liability: $250,000 per occurrence
	 
	Medical Payment Coverage: $5,000
	 
	Workers' Compensation: Statutory coverage (if applicable)
	 
	Employers' Liability: $1 million per occurrence (if applicable)
	 
	Sexual Abuse and Molestation Coverage: $1 million per occurrence / $2 million aggregate minimum (unless the insurance holder is a District employee)


Other Requirements for Emotional Support Dogs

In addition to obtaining approval, dog owners must adhere to the following conditions:


	Provide proof of current vaccinations, including rabies, and documentation that the dog has been tested for parasites within the last year.
	 
	Be registered as an extended clearance on-campus volunteer, ensuring that they have undergone background checks and are cleared to be on school premises.
	 
	Keep the dog leashed and under control at all times during visits to prevent any potential incidents.
	 
	Establish a service agreement with LVJUSD that outlines the requirements and holds the District harmless in case of any issues.
	 
	Submit a site-specific plan to the principal detailing where the dog will be, including a designated pet relief area and emergency procedures.


Annual Parent Notification for Emotional Support Dogs


	Parents/guardians will be notified annually about the presence of emotional support dogs on campus, giving them the opportunity to opt their child out of interaction.
	 
	Clarification on Support Animals:  It is important to distinguish between emotional support dogs and service dogs.  Service dogs are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and are trained to perform specific tasks for individuals with disabilities.  Emotional support dogs, while beneficial, do not have the same legal protections.  

Use of Service Animals by Individuals with Disabilities

For an individual with a disability, service animal means any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks related to the individual's disability and for their benefit. For example, for an individual who is blind or has low vision, a service animal would mean a dog that helps them with vision, navigation, and other tasks; for an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing, a service animal would mean a dog that alerts them to the presence of people or sounds; and for an individual with psychiatric or neurological disabilities, a service animal would mean a dog that assists him/her by preventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive behaviors. (28 CFR 35.104)

Individuals with disabilities may be accompanied on school premises and on school transportation by service animals, including specially trained guide dogs, signal dogs, or service dogs. (Education Code 39839; Civil Code 54.2; 28 CFR 35.136)

The Superintendent or designee may permit the use of a miniature horse as a service animal when the horse has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, provided that: (28 CFR 35.136)

	The District's facility can accommodate the type, size, and weight of the horse.
	 
	The individual has sufficient control of the horse.
	 
	The horse is housebroken.
	 
	The horse's presence in the specific facility does not compromise legitimate safety requirements of the facility.

The Superintendent or designee may ask any individual with a disability to remove his/her service animal from school premises or transportation if the animal is out of control and the individual does not take effective action to control it or the animal is not housebroken. When an individual's service animal is excluded, he/she shall be given an opportunity to participate in the service, program, or activity without having the service animal present. (Education Code 39839; Civil Code 54.2; 28 CFR 35.136)
