## Policy Content

Academic Honesty

The Board of Education believes that academic honesty and personal integrity are fundamental components of a student's education and character development. The Board expects that students will not cheat, lie, plagiarize or commit other acts of academic dishonesty.

Students, parents/guardians, staff and administrators shall be responsible for creating and maintaining a positive school climate that encourages honesty. Students found to have committed an act of academic dishonesty shall be subject to District and school-site discipline rules.

The Superintendent or designee may establish a committee comprised of students, parents/guardians, staff, administrators and members of the public to develop standards of academic honesty, measures of preventing dishonesty, and specific consequences for acts of dishonesty. Any recommendations for discipline shall be incorporated into the school's site level discipline rules.

Prohibited and Permitted Technology Use

As the District's standards for academic achievement are designed to challenge all students to reach their full potential in acquiring the knowledge and skills needed for success in postsecondary education, employment, and responsible citizenship, any use of technology that prevents or inhibits a student from achieving these standards is prohibited. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, using technology primarily or solely for the completion of coursework as a student's original work and generating answers to mathematical, scientific, or analytical problems.

Permitted uses of technology include, but are not limited to, conducting research, correcting grammar and spelling, and learning from educational applications such as tutoring systems and language learning applications.

Additionally, consistent with the limitations expressed in this policy and with teacher consent, students may also use technology to assist with assessments, homework, and/or makeup work or other uses approved by the teacher.

However, a student with a disability shall be permitted to use technology for any purpose identified in the student's individualized education program as a tool to support the student's learning.

If an employee suspects that a student has used technology in violation of this policy, the student shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate that the use of technology was in accordance with this policy.

Any information acquired from an employee's use of technology in determining whether a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty shall be shared with the student, and the student's parent/guardian as appropriate.

The Superintendent or designee may provide training to staff regarding the use of technology to improve education, including the detection of plagiarism and sensitivity to potential discrimination from algorithmic bias.
