## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation is optional.
Petition Signatures

A petition for the establishment of a start-up charter school must be signed by either of the following:  (Education Code 47605)

	A number of parents/guardians equivalent to at least one-half of the number of students that the charter school estimates will enroll in the school for its first year of operation
	 
	A number of teachers equivalent to at least one-half of the total number of teachers that the charter school estimates will be employed at the school during its first year of operation

A petition that proposes to convert an existing public school to a charter school must be signed by at least 50 percent of the permanent status teachers currently employed at the school.  (Education Code 47605)

Any petition circulated to collect signatures shall include a prominent statement explaining that a parent/guardian's signature means that the parent/guardian is meaningfully interested in having a child attend the charter school, or a teacher's signature means that the teacher is meaningfully interested in teaching at the charter school.  (Education Code 47605)

Staff Advisory Committee

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice. CSBA's, "Charter Schools: A Guide for Governance Teams," suggests that a petition review team is one method that a district may use to obtain input on proposed charters. Such a committee might include representatives with expertise in the areas of governance, human resources, business/finance, facilities, curriculum and instruction, special education, and, as appropriate, other student populations. CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services attorneys can also assist with petition reviews for districts that subscribe to that service.Education Code 47605 requires the district to publish staff recommendations regarding the petition at least 15 days prior to the hearing at which the Governing Board will grant or deny the petition; see the section "Timelines for Board Action" in the accompanying Board policy.
The Superintendent or designee may establish a staff advisory committee to evaluate the completeness of a charter petition based on the requirements in Education Code 47605 and to identify any concerns that should be addressed by the petitioners.

Components of Charter Petition

All charter petitions shall comply with the applicable requirements of Education Code 47605, other state and federal laws, and district policies.

CSBA NOTE: CSBA's, "Charter Schools: A Guide for Governance Teams," recommends specific content that would constitute a reasonably comprehensive description of each component listed in Items #1-17 below, as well as additional content that is not required but may be requested of the petitioners (e.g., school calendar, transportation arrangements, a sample of the curriculum and instructional materials).
The charter petition shall include affirmations that the charter school will be nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and operations; will not charge tuition; and will not discriminate against a student on the basis of characteristics listed in Education Code 220. The petition shall also contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of:  (Education Code 47605)

	The educational program of the proposed school, designed, among other things, to identify those whom the school is attempting to educate, what it means to be an "educated person" in the 21st century, and how learning best occurs. The goals identified in that program shall include the objective of enabling students to become self-motivated, competent, and lifelong learners.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47605 requires the charter petition to include annual goals, as described in Education Code 52060, for all students and for each numerically significant subgroup of students, and specific actions to achieve those goals. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, numerically significant subgroups include ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and homeless students, when there are at least 30 students in the subgroup (or at least 15 foster youth or homeless students) in the school. Education Code 47605 requires that these annual goals be aligned with the eight state priorities related to (1) the degree to which teachers are appropriately assigned and fully credentialed, students have sufficient access to standards-aligned instructional materials, and facilities are maintained in good repair; (2) implementation of and student access to state academic content and performance standards; (3) parent/guardian involvement and family engagement; (4) student achievement; (5) student engagement; (6) school climate; (7) student access to and enrollment in a broad course of study, including programs and services provided to benefit low-income students, English learners, and/or foster youth (i.e., "unduplicated students" for purposes of the local control funding formula), and students with disabilities; and (8) student outcomes in the specified course of study. See BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.
	The charter school's annual goals for all students and for each numerically significant subgroup of students identified pursuant to Education Code 52052, including ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and homeless students. These goals shall be aligned with the state priorities listed in Education Code 52060 that apply to the grade levels served. The petition also shall describe specific annual actions to achieve those goals. The petition may identify additional priorities established for the proposed school, goals aligned with those priorities, and specific annual actions to achieve those goals.
	
	If the proposed charter school will serve high school students, the petition shall describe the manner in which the school will inform parents/guardians about the transferability of courses to other public high schools and the eligibility of courses to meet college entrance requirements. Courses offered by the charter school that are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges may be considered transferable, and courses approved by the University of California or the California State University as creditable under the "A-G" admissions criteria may be considered to meet college entrance requirements.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47605 requires that the petition identify student outcomes that the charter school intends to use, including those that address increases in student achievement both schoolwide and for all groups of students served by the charter school. Education Code 47607 defines "all groups of students served by the charter school" to mean all numerically significant subgroups of students, as defined in Education Code 52052, served by the charter school.
	The measurable student outcomes identified for use by the charter school.
	
	Student outcomes means the extent to which all students of the school demonstrate that they have attained the skills, knowledge, and attitudes specified as goals in the school's educational program, including outcomes that address increases in student academic achievement both schoolwide and for each numerically significant subgroup of students served by the charter school. The student outcomes shall align with the state priorities identified in Education Code 52060 that apply for the grade levels served by the charter school.
	 
	The method by which student progress in meeting the identified student outcomes is to be measured. To the extent practicable, the method for measuring student outcomes for state priorities shall be consistent with the way information is reported on a school accountability report card.
	 
	The governance structure of the charter school, including, but not limited to, the process to be followed by the school to ensure parent/guardian involvement.
	 
	The qualifications to be met by individuals to be employed by the charter school.
	 
	The procedures that the charter school will follow to ensure the health and safety of students and staff, including the following requirements:
	 
	
		Each charter school employee shall furnish the school with a criminal record summary as described in Education Code 44237.
		 
		The charter school shall develop a school safety plan which includes the topics listed in Education Code 32282(a)(2)(A)-(J).
		 
		The charter school's safety plan shall be reviewed and updated by March 1 each year.
		 
	
	
	The means by which the charter school will achieve a balance of racial and ethnic students, special education students, and English learner students, including redesignated fluent English proficient students, that is reflective of the general population residing within the district's territorial jurisdiction.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47605, when the number of students who wish to attend the charter school exceeds the school's capacity, attendance must be determined by a public random drawing, with admission preference extending to students who currently attend the charter school and students who reside in the district. Education Code 47605 provides that admission preferences may also include, but are not limited to, siblings of students admitted or attending the charter school and children of the school's teachers, staff, and founders identified in the initial charter. Education Code 47605 requires that the priority order for preference be determined in the charter petition as provided below.
	The charter school's student admission policy. The petition shall, in accordance with Education Code 47605(e), specify procedures for determining enrollment when the number of applicants exceeds the school's capacity, including requirements for the use of a public random drawing, admission preferences, and priority order of preferences as required by law and subject to Governing Board approval.
	 
	The manner in which annual, independent financial audits shall be conducted, which shall employ generally accepted accounting principles, and the manner in which audit exceptions and deficiencies shall be resolved to the Board's satisfaction.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47605 requires that the suspension and expulsion procedures included in the charter petition prohibit the involuntary removal of a student, unless written notice of intent to remove the student has been given to the student and the student's parent/guardian. When such a student is a foster child or youth, homeless child, or Indian child, as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code 224.1, Education Code 47605, as amended by AB 740 (Ch. 400, Statutes of 2022), requires such notifications to also be given to other specified individuals, such as a foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, a homeless child's educational rights holder, and an Indian child's tribal social worker, and if applicable, county social worker. Pursuant to Education Code 47605, as amended by AB 740, these individuals have the same rights as a parent/guardian to receive a suspension notice, expulsion notice, manifestation determination notice, involuntary transfer notice, and other documents and related information. Additionally, Education Code 47606.2 requires that the suspension procedures included in the charter petition provide that (1) upon request of a student who has been suspended for two or more school days, or the student's parent/guardian or other person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student, the homework assigned during the period of suspension be given and (2) any such completed homework shall not count towards the student's overall grade in the class unless the assignments are graded before the end of the academic term.
	The procedures by which students can be suspended or expelled for disciplinary reasons or otherwise involuntarily removed for any reason, including an explanation of how the charter school will comply with federal and state constitutional procedural and substantive due process requirements as specified in Education Code 47605.
	
	Such procedures shall contain a clear statement that no student shall be involuntarily removed by the charter school for any reason unless written notice of the intent to remove the student is given to the student's parent/guardian at least five schooldays before the effective date of the removal. In the case of a homeless student or foster youth, the notice shall be given to the student's educational rights holder. Additionally, a foster youth's attorney and county social worker, and an Indian child's tribal social worker, and if applicable, the county social worker, shall be given such notice.
	
	The notice shall inform the student, the student's parent/guardian, and any other specified individual, as applicable, of the right to initiate a hearing as described in Education Code 47605, before the effective date of the removal. The notice shall be provided in the student's parent/guardian's, or other applicable person's language, and, if such a hearing is initiated, shall include the student's right to remain enrolled in the charter school until a final decision is made by the charter school.
	
	In addition, the procedures shall contain a statement pertaining to the provision of homework assignments to suspended students as specified in Education Code 47606.2.
	
	Such procedures shall also include processes by which the charter school will notify the Superintendent of the district of the student's last known address and, upon request, provide the student's cumulative record to the district, when a student is expelled or leaves the charter school without graduating or completing the school year for any reason. In addition, the procedures shall describe the means by which the district can contact the charter school if the student is subsequently expelled or leaves the school district without graduating or completing the school year for any reason.
	
	Involuntarily removed means disenrolled, dismissed, transferred, or terminated, but does not include suspensions.  (Education Code 47605)
	 
	The manner by which staff members of the charter school will be covered by the State Teachers' Retirement System, the Public Employees' Retirement System, or federal social security.
	 
	The public school attendance alternatives for students residing within the district who choose to not attend the charter school.
	 
	A description of the rights of any district employee upon leaving district employment to work in the charter school and of any rights of return to the district after employment at the charter school.
	 
	The procedures to be followed by the charter school and the Board to resolve disputes relating to charter provisions.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47605 requires charter petitions to contain the declaration specified in Item #16 below regarding responsibilities for collective bargaining. If the charter school is not deemed the public school employer for purposes of collective bargaining under Government Code 3540-3549.3, the district where the charter school is located shall be deemed the public school employer for these purposes, pursuant to Education Code 47611.5. Education Code 47611.5 further provides that, if the charter does not specify that the charter school shall comply with laws and regulations governing tenure or a merit or civil service system, the scope of representation for that charter school shall also include discipline and dismissal of charter school employees.
	A declaration as to whether the charter school will be deemed the exclusive public school employer of the school's employees for purposes of collective bargaining under Government Code 3540-3549.3.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47605 and 5 CCR 11962 require the charter petition to include procedures to be used in the event that the charter school closes for any reason, as provided in Item #17 below. Duties of the district pertaining to charter school closures include notification requirements pursuant to Education Code 47604.32 and 5 CCR 11962.1; see BP 0420.41 - Charter School Oversight.
