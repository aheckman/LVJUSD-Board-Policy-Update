## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that, in order to maximize student learning, achievement, and well-being, certificated staff members must be continuously learning and improving relevant skills.  The Superintendent or designee shall develop a program of ongoing professional development which includes opportunities for teachers to enhance their instructional and classroom management skills, become informed about changes in pedagogy and subject matter, and strengthen practices related to social-emotional development and learning.

The Superintendent or designee shall involve teachers, site and District administrators, and others, as appropriate, when creating, reviewing, and amending the District's staff development program.  The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the District's staff development program is aligned with District priorities for student learning, achievement and well-being, school improvement objectives, the local control and accountability plan, and other District and school plans.

The District's staff development program shall assist certificated staff in developing knowledge and skills, including, but not limited to:

	Mastery of subject-matter knowledge, including current state and District academic standards
	 
	Use of effective, subject-specific teaching methods, strategies, and skills
	 
	Use of technologies to enhance instruction and learning, including face-to-face, remote, or hybrid instruction
	 
	Sensitivity to and ability to meet the needs of diverse student populations, including, but not limited to, students with characteristics specified in Education Code 200 and/or 220, Government Code 11135, and/or Penal Code 422.55
	 
	Understanding of how academic and career technical instruction can be integrated and implemented to increase student learning
	 
	Knowledge of strategies that encourage parents/guardians to participate fully and effectively in their children's education
	 
	Effective classroom management skills and strategies for establishing a climate that promotes respect, fairness, acceptance, and civility, including conflict resolution, hatred prevention, and positive behavioral interventions and supports
	 
	Ability to relate to students, understand their various stages of growth and development, and motivate them to learn
	 
	Ability to interpret and use data and assessment results to guide instruction
	 
	Knowledge of topics related to student mental and physical health, safety, and welfare, which may include social-emotional learning and trauma-informed practices
	 
	Knowledge of topics related to employee health, safety, and security

The Superintendent or designee shall, in conjunction with teachers, interns, and administrators, as appropriate, develop an individualized program of professional growth to increase competence, performance, and effectiveness in teaching and classroom management and, as necessary, to assist them in meeting state or federal requirements to be fully qualified for their positions.

Professional learning opportunities offered by the District shall be evaluated based on the criteria specified in Education Code 44277.  Such opportunities may be part of a coherent plan that combines school activities within a school, including lesson study or co-teaching, and external learning opportunities that are related to academic subjects taught, provide time to meet and work with other teachers, and support instruction and student learning.  Learning activities may include, but are not limited to, mentoring projects for new teachers, extra support for teachers to improve practice, and collaboration time for teachers to develop new instructional lessons, select or develop common formative assessments, or analyze student data.  (Education Code 44277)

The District's staff evaluation process may be used to recommend additional individualized staff development for individual employees.

The Board may budget funds for actual and reasonable expenses incurred by staff who participate in staff development activities.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide a means for continual evaluation of the benefit of staff development activities to both staff and students and shall regularly report to the Board regarding the effectiveness of the staff development program.  Based on the Superintendent's report, the Board may revise the program as necessary to ensure that the staff development program supports the District's priorities for student achievement and well-being.
