## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE:     The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.As part of building positive media relations, the district may consider presenting awards to media representatives who have helped support district goals and programs. See BP 1150 - Commendations and Awards. The district may also nominate journalists for CSBA's Golden Quill Award, which recognizes fair, insightful, and accurate reporting of the objectives, operations, accomplishments, challenges, and opportunities related to public schools.
The Governing Board respects the public's desire for and right to information and recognizes that the media significantly influence the community's understanding of school programs, student achievement, and school safety.  In order to develop and maintain positive media relations, the Board and Superintendent shall reasonably accommodate media requests for information and provide accurate, reliable, and timely information.

In conjunction with the Superintendent or designee, the Board shall periodically establish priorities and key messages for proactively communicating with the media regarding current district issues, activities, or needs.

Media representatives are welcome at all public Board meetings and shall receive meeting agendas upon request in accordance with Board policy.

CSBA NOTE: Penal Code 627.2 requires all "outsiders" to register upon entering school grounds during school hours. Pursuant to Penal Code 627.1, media representatives are not defined as "outsiders." However, the Attorney General has opined (79 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 58 (1996)) that, pursuant to Education Code 32212, districts are authorized to prevent interference with the orderly educational activities of the school, which may include restricting media representatives in the same manner that access by the general public may be limited (e.g., registration or accompaniment by a staff member when on school grounds). According to the Attorney General opinion, a district that has developed a policy requiring all members of the general public, both visitors and outsiders, to register upon entering school grounds may similarly require media representatives to register before coming on campus. Although Attorney General opinions are not binding on the courts, they are generally afforded deference when there is no specific statutory or case law to the contrary. See BP/AR 1250 - Visitors/Outsiders for options regarding registration.The following optional paragraph is only for use by districts that require all visitors to register upon entering school grounds, and does not apply to districts that only require outsiders to register. Districts should ensure consistency with this paragraph and BP 1250 - Visitors/Outsiders.
Media representatives, like all other visitors, shall register immediately upon entering any school building or grounds when school is in session.

Staff may provide the media with student directory information, as identified in AR 5125.1 - Release of Directory Information, unless the student's parent/guardian has submitted a written request that such information not be disclosed.  The district shall not release other student records or personally identifiable student information that is private or confidential as required by law, Board policy, or administrative regulation.

Interviewing and Photographing Students

CSBA NOTE: In 79 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 58 (1996), the Attorney General stated that, because students have a constitutional right to free speech, school administrators may not require prior written parental permission before allowing media representatives to interview particular students on campus. However, Education Code 48907 and 48950 and case law clarify that the district may adopt reasonable provisions for the time, place, and manner in which free expression may occur within the district's jurisdiction. Therefore, in some circumstances (e.g., interviews during class time or interviews that identify other students by name), it may be appropriate to limit the student's ability to talk with the media on campus. Because this is a complex area of law, districts should consult with legal counsel before adopting a policy or practice that may limit students' constitutional rights.Neither the Attorney General opinion nor case law considers the rights of media to photograph students on school grounds. However, the same concerns raised with regard to student interviews, such as a substantial disruption to the orderly operation of school or a substantial invasion of the rights of others, including privacy rights, may exist with regard to photos. Furthermore, in some cases, the publishing of a photo may affect student safety, such as when a student's attendance is concealed from a parent due to a domestic violence restraining order. Districts should consult with legal counsel before adopting a policy or practice that may limit the photographing of students by the media.The following optional paragraph should be revised to reflect district practice.
The district shall not impose restraints on students' right to speak freely with media representatives.  However, interviewing and photographing students shall not create substantial disruption to the orderly operation of the school or impinge on the rights or safety of students.  Therefore, the district shall encourage media representatives who wish to interview or photograph students at school to make prior arrangements with the principal.

Media Contacts/Spokespersons

CSBA NOTE: The following section should be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall identify the district's and/or site's primary media contact to whom all media inquiries shall be routed.  Spokespersons designated to speak to the media on behalf of the district include the Board president, Superintendent, public information officer, or district communications director.  Other Board members and/or staff may be asked by the Superintendent or designee to speak to the media on a case-by-case basis, depending on their expertise on an issue or appropriateness given a particular situation.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training on effective media relations to all designated spokespersons.

Crisis Communications Plan

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice. CSBA recommends that districts develop a crisis communications plan to help ensure that accurate and timely information is provided to students, parents/guardians, the community, and the media during a crisis or natural disaster. This crisis plan may be a separate document or may be incorporated into other safety plans such as the district's comprehensive safety plan (see AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan) and/or emergency and disaster preparedness plan (see AR 3516 - Emergencies and Disaster Preparedness Plan).
The Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for working with the media to provide timely and accurate information to students, parents/guardians, and the community during a crisis or natural disaster. The crisis communications plan may include, but not be limited to, identification of a media center, strategies for press conference logistics, and development and integration of both internal and external notification systems, including public address systems, social media, web site postings, and text alerts.

The Superintendent or designee shall include local law enforcement, media representatives, and district technology personnel in the crisis planning process.
