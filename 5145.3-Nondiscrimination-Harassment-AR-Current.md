## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following mandated administrative regulation provides measures that may be implemented by a district to comply with state and federal laws and regulations prohibiting unlawful discrimination at school or in school-sponsored or school-related activities, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, and bullying, of any student based on the student's actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, nationality, national origin, immigration status, ethnic group identification, ethnicity, age, religion, marital status, pregnancy, parental status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, or any other legally protected category or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. 34 CFR 106.2 and 106.10, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, clarify that discrimination on the basis of sex for the purpose of Title IX includes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes; sex characteristics; sexual orientation; gender identity; pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation, including related medical conditions or recovery; and parental, marital, and family status. Federal and state law also prohibit retaliation against those who engage in activity to protect civil rights.5 CCR 4621 mandates the district to identify in its policies and procedures the person(s), position(s), or unit(s) responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations governing educational programs, including the receiving and investigating of complaints alleging unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying. Additionally, 34 CFR 106.8 and other federal regulations mandate districts that receive federal financial assistance to adopt procedures for the "prompt and equitable" resolution of student and employee discrimination complaints, including the designation of one or more responsible employees to ensure district compliance with federal laws and regulations governing the district's educational programs.During the Federal Program Monitoring process, California Department of Education (CDE) staff will check to ensure that the district's procedures list the specific title(s) of the employee(s) responsible for investigating complaints. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is the agency responsible for the administrative enforcement of federal antidiscrimination laws and regulations in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance from the department. In reviewing a district's discrimination policies and procedures, OCR will examine whether the district has identified the employee(s) responsible for coordinating compliance with federal civil rights laws, including the investigation of complaints.The following paragraph identifies the employee(s) designated to coordinate the district's efforts to comply with state and federal civil rights laws as the same person designated to ensure district compliance, and receive, investigate and resolve discrimination complaints under AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures. Districts may modify the following paragraph to designate different district employees to serve these functions. Note also that a district may designate more than one employee to coordinate compliance and/or receive and investigate complaints, although each employee designated as a coordinator/compliance officer must be properly trained.34 CFR 106.8 requires that the employee designated by the district to coordinate its responsibilities under Title IX be referred to as the Title IX Coordinator. If the district has more than one Title IX Coordinator, it must designate one of its Title IX Coordinators to retain ultimate oversight over those responsibilities and ensure the district's consistent compliance with its responsibilities under Title IX. It is recommended that the Title IX Coordinator be the same person designated below and in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, and, if the district wishes to separate out these responsibilities, for one individual to designate designees and maintain oversight. See AR 5145.7 - Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment.
The district designates the individual(s) identified below as the Compliance Officer(s). The employee(s) is responsible for coordinating the district's efforts to comply with applicable state and federal civil rights laws and to answer inquiries regarding the district's nondiscrimination policies. The individual(s) shall also serve as the Compliance Officer(s) specified in Administrative Regulation 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures as the responsible employee to handle complaints alleging unlawful discrimination of a student, and the Title IX Coordinator specified in Administrative Regulation 5145.7 - Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment as the responsible employee to handle complaints alleging unlawful sex discrimination and sex-based harassment, as permitted by law. The Compliance Officer(s) may be contacted at:  (Education Code 234.1; 5 CCR 4621)

Measures to Prevent Discrimination

To prevent unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, and bullying, of students at district schools or in school activities and to ensure equal access of all students to the educational program, the Superintendent or designee shall implement the following measures:

CSBA NOTE: As part of its responsibility to monitor district compliance with legal requirements concerning discrimination pursuant to Education Code 234.1, as amended by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), CDE is required to ensure that the district prominently and conspicuously displays its nondiscrimination policies in all areas that are accessible to, and commonly frequented by, school site employees, students, and members of the public at each school site and district office, including, but not limited to, in school office lobbies, staff lounges, student government meeting rooms, and on the district's website.In addition, federal regulations enforced by OCR require the district to notify students, parents/guardians, and employees of its policies prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex (34 CFR 106.8), disability (34 CFR 104.8 and 28 CFR 35.107), and age (34 CFR 110.25) and of related complaint procedures.For additional notification requirements specific to sex discrimination and sex-based harassment, see BP/AR 5145.7 - Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment.


	Publicize the district's nondiscrimination policy and related complaint procedures, including the Compliance Officer's contact information, to students, parents/guardians, employees, volunteers, and the general public by posting them in prominent locations and providing easy access to them through district-supported communications
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.1, as amended by SB 153, and 234.6 requires a district to post its nondiscrimination policies on its website as specified below. In addition to the policies listed below, if the district has a policy in regard to the prevention and response to hate violence, it is also required to be posted, and the following item should be modified accordingly. See BP 5145.9 - Hate-Motivated Behavior.
	Post the district's policies and procedures prohibiting discrimination, harassment, student sex-based harassment, intimidation, bullying, and cyberbullying, including a section on social media bullying that includes all of the references described in Education Code 234.6 as possible forums for social media, in a prominent location on the district's website in a manner that is easily accessible to parents/guardians and students  (Education Code 234.1, 234.6)
	 
	Post the definition of sex discrimination and harassment as described in Education Code 230, including the rights set forth in Education Code 221.8, in a prominent location on the district's website in a manner that is easily accessible to parents/guardians and students  (Education Code 234.6)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 221.61 requires districts and public schools to post on their websites information related to Title IX (20 USC 1681-1688). Education Code 234.6 requires districts to post the Title IX information required pursuant to 221.61 in a prominent location on the district's website in a manner that is easily accessible to parents/guardians and students. Additionally, districts are required to provide a link to the Title IX information included on CDE's website pursuant to Education Code 221.6, in the same manner. A comprehensive list of rights based on the federal regulations implementing Title IX can be found in Education Code 221.8. A district that does not maintain a website may comply by posting the information below on the website of its county office of education. A school without a website may comply by posting the information on the website of the district or county office of education.
	Post in a prominent location on the district website in a manner that is easily accessible to parents/guardians and students information regarding Title IX prohibitions against discrimination based on a student's sex; sex characteristics; sexual orientation; gender; gender identity; pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy or lactation, including related medical conditions or recovery; and parental, marital, and family status, including the following:  (Education Code 221.6, 221.61, 234.6)
	 
	
		The name and contact information of the district's Title IX Coordinator, including the phone number and email address
		 
		The rights of students and the public and the responsibilities of the district under Title IX, including a list of rights as specified in Education Code 221.8 and web links to information about those rights and responsibilities located on the websites of the Office for Equal Opportunity and the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR)
		 
		A description of how to file a complaint of noncompliance under Title IX, which shall include:
		 
		
			An explanation of the statute of limitations within which a complaint must be filed after an alleged incident of discrimination has occurred and how a complaint may be filed beyond the statute of limitations
			 
			An explanation of how the complaint will be investigated and how the complainant may further pursue the complaint, including web links to this information on OCR's website
			 
			A web link to the OCR complaints form and the contact information for the office, including the phone number and email address for the office
			 
		
		
		A link to the Title IX information included on the California Department of Education's (CDE) website
		
		CSBA NOTE: Item #5 is for districts that participate in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF). In order to track racial discrimination, harassment, or hazing that occurs at high school sporting games or events, Education Code 33353, as amended by AB 1327 (Ch. 366, Statutes of 2023), requires a district that participates in CIF to post on its website, by April 1, 2025, a standardized incident form developed by CDE, including information on how to submit a completed incident form to the district. The district is required to submit information related to any completed standardized incident form to CDE, if requested.
	
	
	By April 1, 2025, post CDE's standardized incident form to track racial discrimination, harassment, or hazing that occurs at high school sporting games or events, including information on how to submit a completed incident form to the district  (Education Code 33353)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Title IX and its implementing regulation 34 CFR 106.8, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, districts are required to provide a notice of nondiscrimination on the basis of sex, as specified below.
	Post in a prominent location on the district's website and include in each handbook, catalog, announcement, bulletin, and application form for students, parents/guardians or other authorized legal representative, and employees, the Title IX notice of nondiscrimination which includes the following:  (34 CFR 106.8)
	 
	
		The district does not discriminate on the basis of sex in any education program or activity that it operates
		 
		Inquiries about the application of Title IX may be referred to the district's Title IX Coordinator and/or OCR
		 
		The name or title, office and email address, and telephone number of the district's Title IX Coordinator

		How to report conduct that may constitute sex discrimination under Title IX
		 
		How to make a complaint of Title IX sex discrimination
		
		If necessary due to the format or size of any publication specified above, the district may include only the statement that the district prohibits sex discrimination in any education program or activity that it operates, that individuals may report concerns or questions to the Title IX Coordinator, and the location of the complete notice on the district's website.
		
		The district shall not distribute a publication stating that the district treats students, employees or applicants differently on the basis of sex, unless such treatment is permitted by Title IX.
		 
	
	
	Post a link to statewide CDE-compiled resources, including community-based organizations, that provide support to youth who have been subjected to school-based discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying and to their families  (Education Code 234.5)
	
	Such resources shall be posted in a prominent location on the district's website in a manner that is easily accessible to parents/guardians and students.  (Education Code 234.6)
	 
	Provide to students a handbook that contains age-appropriate information that clearly describes the district's nondiscrimination policy, procedures for filing a complaint, and resources available to students who feel that they have been the victim of any such behavior
	 
	Annually notify all students and parents/guardians of the district's nondiscrimination policy, including its responsibility to provide a safe, nondiscriminatory school environment for all students
	
	The notice shall inform students and parents/guardians that they may request to meet with the Compliance Officer to determine how best to accommodate or resolve concerns that may arise from the district's implementation of its nondiscrimination policies. The notice shall also inform all students and parents/guardians that, to the extent possible, the district will address any individual student's interests and concerns in private.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Both federal and state laws contain requirements for translation of certain information and documents. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires school districts to ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by persons with limited English proficiency. OCR has interpreted this to require that, whenever information is provided to parents/guardians, districts must notify limited-English-proficient (LEP) parents/guardians in a language other than English in order to be adequate. OCR enforces this requirement consistent with the Department of Justice's 2003, "Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons." Under the Guidance, a recipient of federal funds has an obligation to provide language assistance to LEP individuals based on balancing four factors: (1) the number or proportion of LEP individuals likely to encounter or be served by the program, (2) the frequency with which LEP individuals come in contact with the program, (3) the nature and importance of the services provided by the program, and (4) the resources available to the recipient and costs. State law is more specific than federal law. Education Code 48985 requires translation of certain information and documents if 15 percent or more of students enrolled in the school speak a single primary language other than English.
	Ensure that students and parents/guardians, including those with limited English proficiency, are notified of how to access the relevant information provided in the district's nondiscrimination policy and related complaint procedures, notices, and forms in a language they can understand
	
	If 15 percent or more of students enrolled in a particular district school speak a single primary language other than English, the district's policy, regulation, forms, and notices concerning nondiscrimination shall be translated into that language in accordance with Education Code 234.1 and 48985. In all other instances, the district shall ensure meaningful access to all relevant information for parents/guardians with limited English proficiency.
	 
	Provide to students, employees, volunteers, and parents/guardians age-appropriate training and/or information regarding the district's nondiscrimination policy; what constitutes prohibited discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying; how and to whom a report of an incident should be made; and how to guard against segregating or stereotyping students when providing instruction, guidance, supervision, or other services to them
	
	Such training and information shall include details of guidelines the district may use to provide a discrimination-free environment for all district students.
	
	CSBA NOTE:  Item #12 applies to districts that serve students in any of grades 7-12. Pursuant to Education Code 234.1, as amended by SB 153, a district is required to provide certificated school employees serving students in any of grades 7-12 information on existing school and community resources related to the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ ) students, or related to the support of students who may face bias or bullying as specified below.
	Provide to certificated employees serving students in grades 7-12 information on existing school and community resources related to the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ+) students, or related to the support of students who may face bias or bullying on the basis of any of the actual or perceived characteristics in Penal Code 422.55, including immigration status; Education Code 220; and disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation; or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics  (Education Code 234.1)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #13 applies to districts that serve students in any of grades 7-12. Starting in the 2025-26 school year through the 2029-2030 school year, Education Code 218.3, as added by AB 5 (Ch. 220, Statutes of 2023), requires a district serving students in any of grades 7-12 to provide at least one hour of training annually to all teachers and certificated employees serving students in grades 7-12 which incorporates CDE's online training curriculum to support LGBTQ  cultural competency. The district is required to maintain records documenting the date that each employee completed the training and the name of the entity that provided the training.
	For the 2025-2026 school year through the 2029-2030 school year, provide annually to certificated employees serving students in grades 7-12 at least one hour of training to support LGBTQ+ cultural competency in accordance with Education Code 218.3
	 
	At the beginning of each school year, inform school employees that any employee who witnesses any act of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying, against a student is required to intervene if it is safe to do so  (Education Code 234.1)
	
	CSBA NOTE:  Item #15 below may be revised to reflect district practice. In some situations, the district may need to provide assistance to a student to protect the student from harassment or bullying. Each situation will need to be analyzed to determine the most appropriate course of action to meet the needs of the student, based on the circumstances involved.
	At the beginning of each school year, inform each principal or designee of the district's responsibility to provide appropriate assistance or resources to protect students from threatened or potentially discriminatory behavior and ensure their privacy rights

Process for Initiating and Responding to Complaints

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.1 requires that districts adopt a process for receiving and investigating complaints of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, and bullying. Such a process, which is required to be consistent with the uniform complaint procedures (UCP) specified in 5 CCR 4600-4670, must include (1) a requirement that school personnel who witness an act take immediate steps to intervene when safe to do so, (2) a timeline for investigating and resolving complaints, (3) an appeal process, and (4) translation of forms when required by Education Code 48985. In addition, federal regulations require districts to adopt procedures providing for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex (34 CFR 106.8), disability (34 CFR 104.7 and 28 CFR 35.107), and age (34 CFR 110.25).
Students who feel that they have been subjected to unlawful discrimination described above or in district policy are strongly encouraged to immediately contact the Compliance Officer, Title IX Coordinator, principal, or any other staff member. In addition, students who observe any such incident are strongly encouraged to report the incident to the Compliance Officer, Title IX Coordinator, or principal, regardless of whether the alleged victim files a complaint.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph related to employee reporting of unlawful discrimination should be revised to reflect the district's timeline.
Any school employee who observes an incident of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, or to whom such an incident is reported shall report the incident to the Compliance Officer, Title IX Coordinator, or principal within one workday, regardless of whether the alleged victim files a complaint.

Any school employee who witnesses an incident of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, shall immediately intervene to stop the incident when it is safe to do so.  (Education Code 234.1)

CSBA NOTE: Though a formal complaint must be in writing pursuant to 5 CCR 4600, the district's obligation to provide a safe school environment for its students overrides the need to comply with formalities. Thus, once the district receives notice of an incident, whether verbally or in writing, it is good practice to begin the investigation of the report and to take steps to stop any prohibited conduct and address any effect on students. The following paragraph reflects such practice.Pursuant to 34 CFR 106.11 and 106.44, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, a district with knowledge of alleged conduct, which occurs in a district program or activity on or after August 1, 2024, that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, is required to follow Title IX grievance procedures when investigating and resolving a complaint based on the alleged conduct. As such a complaint may also fall within the scope of the UCP, it is unclear whether districts would additionally be required to follow the UCP. Due to this uncertainty, districts are advised to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel prior to utilizing the UCP for this purpose. For more information regarding the Title IX grievance procedures, see AR 5145.71 - Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures.
When a report of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, is made to or received by the principal, Compliance Officer, or Title IX Coordinator, the principal, Compliance officer, or Title IX Coordinator shall notify the student or parent/guardian of the right to file a formal complaint in accordance with Administrative Regulation 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures or, for complaints of sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment, the right to initiate the Title IX grievance procedures as specified in Administrative Regulation 5145.71 - Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures. Once notified verbally or in writing, the Compliance Officer or Title IX Coordinator shall begin the investigation and shall implement immediate measures necessary to stop the discrimination and ensure that all students have access to the educational program and a safe school environment. Any interim measures adopted to address unlawful discrimination shall, to the extent possible, not disadvantage the complainant or a student who is the victim of the alleged unlawful discrimination.

Any report or complaint alleging unlawful discrimination by the principal, Compliance Officer, Title IX Coordinator, or any other person to whom a report would ordinarily be made or complaint filed shall instead be made to or filed with the Superintendent or designee who shall determine how the complaint will be investigated.

	<div id='yMg464' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Both federal and state laws contain requirements for translation of certain information and documents. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires school districts to ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by persons with limited English proficiency. OCR has interpreted this to require that, whenever information is provided to parents/guardians, districts must notify limited-English-proficient (LEP) parents/guardians in a language other than English in order to be adequate. OCR enforces this requirement consistent with the Department of Justice's 2003, "Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons." Under the Guidance, a recipient of federal funds has an obligation to provide language assistance to LEP individuals based on balancing four factors: (1) the number or proportion of LEP individuals likely to encounter or be served by the program, (2) the frequency with which LEP individuals come in contact with the program, (3) the nature and importance of the services provided by the program, and (4) the resources available to the recipient and costs. State law is more specific than federal law. Education Code 48985 requires translation of certain information and documents if 15 percent or more of students enrolled in the school speak a single primary language other than English.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="wODYOQ6" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22wODYOQ6%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22yMg464%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1721502981%2C%22text%22%3A%22Both%20federal%20and%20state%20laws%20contain%20requirements%20for%20translation%20of%20certain%20information%20and%20documents.%20Title%20VI%20of%20the%20Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964%20requires%20school%20districts%20to%20ensure%20meaningful%20access%20to%20their%20programs%20and%20activities%20by%20persons%20with%20limited%20English%20proficiency.%20OCR%20has%20interpreted%20this%20to%20require%20that%2C%20whenever%20information%20is%20provided%20to%20parents/guardians%2C%20districts%20must%20notify%20limited-English-proficient%20%28LEP%29%20parents/guardians%20in%20a%20language%20other%20than%20English%20in%20order%20to%20be%20adequate.%20OCR%20enforces%20this%20requirement%20consistent%20with%20the%20Department%20of%20Justice%27s%202003%2C%20%5C%22Guidance%20to%20Federal%20Financial%20Assistance%20Recipients%20Regarding%20Title%20VI%20Prohibition%20Against%20National%20Origin%20Discrimination%20Affecting%20Limited%20English%20Proficient%20Persons.%5C%22%20Under%20the%20Guidance%2C%20a%20recipient%20of%20federal%20funds%20has%20an%20obligation%20to%20provide%20language%20assistance%20to%20LEP%20individuals%20based%20on%20balancing%20four%20factors%3A%20%281%29%20the%20number%20or%20proportion%20of%20LEP%20individuals%20likely%20to%20encounter%20or%20be%20served%20by%20the%20program%2C%20%282%29%20the%20frequency%20with%20which%20LEP%20individuals%20come%20in%20contact%20with%20the%20program%2C%20%283%29%20the%20nature%20and%20importance%20of%20the%20services%20provided%20by%20the%20program%2C%20and%20%284%29%20the%20resources%20available%20to%20the%20recipient%20and%20costs.%20State%20law%20is%20more%20specific%20than%20federal%20law.%20Education%20Code%2048985%20requires%20translation%20of%20certain%20information%20and%20documents%20if%2015%20percent%20or%20more%20of%20students%20enrolled%20in%20the%20school%20speak%20a%20single%20primary%20language%20other%20than%20English.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-wODYOQ6" title="CSBA NOTE: Both federal and state laws contain req..."></annotation></li>

<div id='EOQ470' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Though a formal complaint must be in writing pursuant to 5 CCR 4600, the district's obligation to provide a safe school environment for its students overrides the need to comply with formalities. Thus, once the district receives notice of an incident, whether verbally or in writing, it is good practice to begin the investigation of the report and to take steps to stop any prohibited conduct and address any effect on students. The following paragraph reflects such practice.<br><br>Pursuant to 34 CFR 106.11 and 106.44, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, a district with knowledge of alleged conduct, which occurs in a district program or activity on or after August 1, 2024, that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, is required to follow Title IX grievance procedures when investigating and resolving a complaint based on the alleged conduct. As such a complaint may also fall within the scope of the UCP, it is unclear whether districts would additionally be required to follow the UCP. Due to this uncertainty, districts are advised to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel prior to utilizing the UCP for this purpose. For more information regarding the Title IX grievance procedures, see AR 5145.71 - Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="wODYOQ12" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22wODYOQ12%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22EOQ470%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1721503269%2C%22text%22%3A%22Though%20a%20formal%20complaint%20must%20be%20in%20writing%20pursuant%20to%205%20CCR%204600%2C%20the%20district%27s%20obligation%20to%20provide%20a%20safe%20school%20environment%20for%20its%20students%20overrides%20the%20need%20to%20comply%20with%20formalities.%20Thus%2C%20once%20the%20district%20receives%20notice%20of%20an%20incident%2C%20whether%20verbally%20or%20in%20writing%2C%20it%20is%20good%20practice%20to%20begin%20the%20investigation%20of%20the%20report%20and%20to%20take%20steps%20to%20stop%20any%20prohibited%20conduct%20and%20address%20any%20effect%20on%20students.%20The%20following%20paragraph%20reflects%20such%20practice.%5Cn%5CnPursuant%20to%2034%20CFR%20106.11%20and%20106.44%2C%20as%20amended%20by%2089%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033474%2C%20a%20district%20with%20knowledge%20of%20alleged%20conduct%2C%20which%20occurs%20in%20a%20district%20program%20or%20activity%20on%20or%20after%20August%201%2C%202024%2C%20that%20reasonably%20may%20constitute%20sex%20discrimination%20under%20Title%20IX%2C%20including%20sex-based%20harassment%2C%20is%20required%20to%20follow%20Title%20IX%20grievance%20procedures%20when%20investigating%20and%20resolving%20a%20complaint%20based%20on%20the%20alleged%20conduct.%20As%20such%20a%20complaint%20may%20also%20fall%20within%20the%20scope%20of%20the%20UCP%2C%20it%20is%20unclear%20whether%20districts%20would%20additionally%20be%20required%20to%20follow%20the%20UCP.%20Due%20to%20this%20uncertainty%2C%20districts%20are%20advised%20to%20consult%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel%20prior%20to%20utilizing%20the%20UCP%20for%20this%20purpose.%20For%20more%20information%20regarding%20the%20Title%20IX%20grievance%20procedures%2C%20see%20AR%205145.71%20-%20Title%20IX%20Sex%20Discrimination%20and%20Sex-Based%20Harassment%20Complaint%20Procedures.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-wODYOQ12" title="CSBA NOTE: Though a formal complaint must be in wr..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
When a report of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, is made to or received by the principal, Compliance Officer, or Title IX Coordinator, the principal, Compliance officer, or Title IX Coordinator shall notify the student or parent/guardian of the right to file a formal complaint in accordance with Administrative Regulation 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures or, for complaints of sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment, the right to initiate the Title IX grievance procedures as specified in Administrative Regulation 5145.71 - Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures. Once notified verbally or in writing, the Compliance Officer or Title IX Coordinator shall begin the investigation and shall implement immediate measures necessary to stop the discrimination and ensure that all students have access to the educational program and a safe school environment. Any interim measures adopted to address unlawful discrimination shall, to the extent possible, not disadvantage the complainant or a student who is the victim of the alleged unlawful discrimination.<br>
<br>
Any report or complaint alleging unlawful discrimination by the principal, Compliance Officer, Title IX Coordinator, or any other person to whom a report would ordinarily be made or complaint filed shall instead be made to or filed with the Superintendent or designee who shall determine how the complaint will be investigated.</body>
