## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the District's responsibility to keep the public informed regarding the goals, programs, achievements, and needs of the schools and District and to be responsive to the concerns and interests of the community. The Superintendent or designee shall establish strategies for effective two-way communications between the District and the public and shall consult with the Board regarding the role of Board members as advocates for the District's students, programs, and policies.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board and staff with communications protocols and procedures to assist the District in presenting a consistent, unified message on District issues. Such protocols and procedures may include, but are not limited to, identification of the spokesperson(s) authorized to speak to the media on behalf of the District, strategies for coordinating communications efforts and activities, and legal requirements pertaining to confidentiality as well as the public's right to access records.

The Superintendent or designee shall utilize a variety of methods to provide information to the public with access to information. Such methods may include, but are not limited to, District and school newsletters, web sites, social media, electronic communications, mailings, notices sent home with students, recorded telephone messages for parent/guardian information, community forums and public events, news releases, meetings with education reporters and editorial boards, presentations at parent organization meetings, and meetings with representatives of local governments, community organizations, and businesses.

In developing communications strategies, the Superintendent or designee shall take into account the needs of all members of the public, including individuals with disabilities and those whose primary language is not English.

The Superintendent or designee may provide staff members with professional development to assist them in effectively responding to requests for information or assistance by parents/guardians or members of the public.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide multiple avenues and opportunities for members of the public to give input on District and school issues and operations. Community members are encouraged to become involved in school activities, participate on District and school committees, provide input at Board meetings, submit suggestions to District staff, and use the District's complaint procedures as appropriate.

Comprehensive Communications Plan

The Superintendent or designee shall develop a written communications plan which establishes priorities for proactive community outreach to build support for District programs and issues.  The plan shall identify specific communications goals aligned with the District's vision and goals for student learning. For each communications goal, the plan shall identify key messages, individuals or groups that can help the District achieve its goal, strategies tailored to each target audience, timelines, persons responsible for each activity, and budget implications.

As appropriate for each issue, target audiences may include parents/guardians, the media, local governmental agencies, businesses, community organizations and civic groups, postsecondary institutions, health care professionals, child care providers, community leaders, state or federal legislators or agencies, and/or other segments of the public.

The plan shall incorporate strategies for effective communications during a crisis or other emergency situation that may arise.

The Superintendent or designee shall periodically evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the District's communications plan and recommend to the Board whether the goals and key issues identified in the plan need to be revised to meet changing circumstances or priorities.
