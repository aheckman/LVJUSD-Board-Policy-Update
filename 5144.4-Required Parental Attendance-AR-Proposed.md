## Policy Content

Whenever a teacher requires a parent/guardian to attend a portion of a school day with his/her child for the child's commission of an act specified in Education Code 48900 (i) or (k), the principal/designee shall send the parent/guardian a written notice that the parent/guardian's attendance is required pursuant to law. (Education Code 48900.1)

The notice shall:


	Inform the parent/guardian of the date that parent/guardian presence is expected, the length of the visit, and by what means he/she may arrange an alternate date
	 
	State that if the parent/guardian does not have a means of transportation to school, he/she may ride the school bus with the student
	 
	Direct the parent/guardian to meet with the principal after the visit and before leaving school
	 
	Direct the parent/guardian to contact the school if there are reasonable factors that would prevent him/her from complying with the attendance requirement


Attendance of the parent/guardian shall be limited to the class from which the student was removed. (Education Code 48900.1)

A parent/guardian who has received a written notice shall attend class as specified in the notice. After completing the classroom visit and before leaving school premises, the parent/guardian also shall meet with the principal or designee. (Education Code 48900.1)

At the meeting with the student's parent/guardian, the principal or designee shall explain the District's and school's discipline policies, including the disciplinary strategies that may be used to achieve proper student conduct.

When a parent/guardian does not respond to the request to attend school, the principal or designee shall contact him/her by any method that maintains the confidentiality of the student's records.
