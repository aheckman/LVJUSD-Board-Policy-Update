## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide a comprehensive career technical education (CTE) program in the secondary grades which integrates core academic instruction with technical and occupational instruction in order to increase student achievement, graduation rates, and readiness for postsecondary education and employment. The District's CTE program shall be designed to help students develop the academic, career, and technical skills needed to succeed in a knowledge- and skills-based economy.

The District's CTE program shall focus on preparing students to enter current or emerging high-skill, high-wage, and/or high-demand occupations by providing a rigorous academic component and practical experience in all aspects of an industry. CTE opportunities may be offered through partnership academies, apprenticeship programs or orientation to apprenticeships, regional occupational centers or programs (ROC/Ps), charter schools, small learning communities, magnet programs, or other programs that expose students to career options while preparing them for future careers in a given industry or interest area.

The Superintendent or designee shall explore available funding sources that may be used to support CTE programs. The Board shall review and approve all District plans and applications for the use of District, state, and/or federal funds supporting CTE.

The Board shall adopt District standards for CTE which meet or exceed the state's model content standards and describe the essential knowledge and skills that students enrolled in these courses are expected to master.  The course curriculum shall be aligned with District-adopted standards and the state's curriculum framework.

At least every three years, the Board shall compare the District's curriculum, course content, and course sequence of CTE with the model state curriculum standards.  (Education Code 52376)

The Superintendent or designee shall systematically review the District's CTE courses to determine the degree to which each course may offer an alternative means for completing and receiving credit for specific portions of the course of study prescribed by the District for high school graduation.  CTE courses approved for these purposes shall be equivalent in content and rigor to the courses prescribed for graduation.  (Education Code 52376)

The Superintendent or designee shall develop partnerships with local businesses and industries to ensure that course sequences, career technical and integrated curriculum, classroom instruction and projects, and assessments have real-world relevance and reflect labor market needs and priorities. The Superintendent or designee shall also work to develop connections with businesses, postsecondary institutions, community organizations, and/or other employers to provide students with actual or simulated work-based learning opportunities.

The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with postsecondary institutions to ensure that the District's program is articulated with postsecondary programs in order to provide a sequential course of study. Articulation opportunities may include dual or concurrent enrollment in community college courses.

The Board shall appoint a CTE advisory committee to develop recommendations on the District's CTE program and to serve as a liaison between the District and potential employers.  The committee shall consist of at least one student, teacher, business representative, industry representative, school administrator, member of the general public knowledgeable about the disadvantaged, and representative of the field office of the California Employment Development Department.  (Education Code 8070)

The Superintendent or designee shall inform all secondary students and their parents/guardians about the CTE experiences available in the District, CTE courses that satisfy college admission criteria, and, if applicable, CTE courses that satisfy high school graduation requirements.  In addition, secondary students shall receive individualized academic counseling which provides information about academic and CTE opportunities related to the student's career goals.

Prior to the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall advise students, parents/guardians, employees, and the general public that all CTE opportunities are offered without regard to any actual or perceived characteristic protected from discrimination by law. The notification shall be disseminated in languages other than English as needed and shall state that the District will take steps to ensure that the lack of English language skills will not be a barrier to admission and participation in the District's CTE program.  (20 USC 2354; 34 CFR 100 Appendix B, 104.8, 106.9)

To the extent required by law, the Superintendent or designee shall invite the participation of private school students in CTE programs supported by federal funding under the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins).  (20 USC 2397)

The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with businesses, government agencies, postsecondary institutions including universities and career technical schools, community organizations, and/or other employers to provide students with actual or simulated work-based learning opportunities through college and/or career fairs.

When planning to hold a college or career fair, the Superintendent or designee shall notify each apprenticeship program in the county.  The notification shall include the planned date, time and location of the college or career fair.  (Labor Code 3074.2)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that teachers of CTE courses possess the qualifications and credentials necessary to teach their assigned courses. The Superintendent or designee shall also provide teachers and administrators with professional development designed to enhance their knowledge of standards-aligned CTE and shall provide opportunities for CTE teachers to collaborate with teachers of academic courses in the development and implementation of integrated curriculum models.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide counselors and other guidance personnel with professional development that includes, but is not limited to, information about current workforce needs and trends, requirements of the District's CTE program, work-based learning opportunities, and postsecondary education and employment options following high school.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly assess District needs for facilities, technologies, and equipment to increase students' access to the District's CTE program.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board achievement data on participating students, including, but not limited to, the percentage of participating students who successfully complete CTE programs, their performance on state and District academic achievement tests, and graduation rates. Data shall be disaggregated by program and various student subgroups. Based on such data, the Board shall determine the need for program improvements and update the goals in the District's local control and accountability plan as necessary.
