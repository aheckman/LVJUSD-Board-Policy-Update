## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 11503 and 20 USC 6318 mandate each district receiving federal Title I, Part A, funds to have a written parent/guardian and family engagement policy developed jointly with and agreed upon by parents/guardians and family members of participating students. Education Code 11504 mandates districts to adopt a policy on parent/guardian involvement applicable to each school that does not receive Title I funds. The following policy and accompanying administrative regulation contain language satisfying both mandates and should be revised to reflect district practice.In addition, Education Code 51101 mandates policy for all districts addressing the manner in which parents/guardians, school staff, and students may share responsibility for continuing the intellectual, physical, emotional, and social development and well-being of students; see BP/AR 5020 - Parent Rights and Responsibilities for language fulfilling this mandate.For best practices in implementing parent/guardian and family engagement programs, see the California Department of Education's Family Engagement Framework: A Tool for California School Districts.
The Governing Board recognizes that parents/guardians are their children's first and most influential teachers and that sustained parent/guardian involvement in the education of their children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive school environment. The Superintendent or designee shall work with parents/guardians and family members to jointly develop and agree upon policy and strategies to meaningfully involve parents/guardians and family members in district and school activities at all grade levels; advisory, decision-making, and advocacy roles; and activities to support learning at home.

Parents/guardians shall be notified of their rights to be informed about and to participate in their children's education and of the opportunities available to them to do so.

The district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) shall include goals and strategies for parent/guardian involvement and family engagement, including district efforts to seek parent/guardian input in district and school site decision making and to promote parent/guardian participation in programs for English learners, foster youth, students eligible for free and reduced-price meals, and students with disabilities. (Education Code 42238.02, 52060)

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly evaluate and report to the Board on the effectiveness of the district's parent/guardian and family engagement efforts, including, but not limited to, input from parents/guardians, family members, and school staff on the adequacy of involvement opportunities and on barriers that may inhibit participation.

Title I Schools

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that receive Title I funds. 20 USC 6318 mandates that such districts develop, jointly with parents/guardians and family members of participating students, policy which establishes expectations and objectives for meaningful parent/guardian and family involvement and describes how the district will address specified components. See the accompanying administrative regulation for the required components and optional strategies for addressing each component.State law (Education Code 11503) also mandates procedures to ensure that parents/guardians are consulted and participate in the planning, design, implementation, and evaluation of the Title I parent/guardian and family engagement program.
The Superintendent or designee shall involve parents/guardians and family members in establishing district expectations and objectives for meaningful parent/guardian and family engagement in schools supported by Title I funding, developing strategies that describe how the district will carry out each activity listed in 20 USC 6318, as contained in the accompanying administrative regulation, and implementing and evaluating such programs, activities, and procedures. As appropriate, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct outreach to all parents/guardians and family members. (Education Code 11503; 20 USC 6318)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that receive more than $500,000 in Title I, Part A funding. Pursuant to 20 USC 6318, the Governing Board must reserve at least one percent of the district's Title I funding to carry out parent/guardian and family engagement activities, provided that one percent of the allocation received by the district totals more than $5,000.
When the district's Title I, Part A allocation exceeds the amount specified in 20 USC 6318, the Board shall reserve at least one percent of the funding to implement parent/guardian and family engagement activities and shall distribute at least 90 percent of those reserved funds to eligible schools, with priority given to high-need schools as defined in 20 USC 6631. The Superintendent or designee shall involve parents/guardians and family members of participating students in decisions regarding how the district's Title I funds will be allotted for parent/guardian and family engagement activities. (20 USC 6318)

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6318 identifies allowable uses of the Title I funds reserved for parent/guardian and family engagement, as provided below. These uses are consistent with the activities that must be addressed in the district's parent/guardian and family engagement policy, as described in the accompanying administrative regulation.
Expenditures of such funds shall be consistent with the activities specified in this policy and shall include at least one of the following: (20 USC 6318)

	Support for schools and nonprofit organizations in providing professional development for district and school staff regarding parent/guardian and family engagement strategies, which may be provided jointly to teachers, principals, other school leaders, specialized instructional support personnel, paraprofessionals, early childhood educators, and parents/guardians and family members
	 
	Support for programs that reach parents/guardians and family members at home, in the community, and at school
	 
	Dissemination of information on best practices focused on parent/guardian and family engagement, especially best practices for increasing the engagement of economically disadvantaged parents/guardians and family members
	 
	Collaboration, or the provision of subgrants to schools to enable collaboration, with community-based or other organizations or employers with a record of success in improving and increasing parent/guardian and family engagement
	 
	Any other activities and strategies that the district determines are appropriate and consistent with this policy

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that receive funds under federal Title IV, Part E (20 USC 7241-7246).
If the district also receives funds under federal Title IV, Part E, to coordinate and enhance family engagement programs, the Superintendent or designee shall inform parents/guardians and organizations of the existence of Title IV. (20 USC 6318)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6318, the district's parent/guardian and family engagement policy must be incorporated into the district's Title I LEA plan. In California, all the requirements of the LEA plan are addressed in an addendum to the LCAP. See BP 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.
The district's Board policy and administrative regulation containing parent/guardian and family engagement strategies shall be incorporated into the district's LCAP in accordance with 20 USC 6312. (20 USC 6318)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each school receiving Title I funds develops a school-level parent/guardian and family engagement policy in accordance with 20 USC 6318.

District and school-level parent/guardian and family engagement policies and administrative regulations shall be distributed to parents/guardians of students participating in Title I programs and shall be available to the local community. Parents/guardians shall be notified of the policy in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, provided in a language the parents/guardians can understand. (20 USC 6318)

Non-Title I Schools

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that do not receive any Title I funds or that have one or more individual schools that do not receive Title I funds. Education Code 11504 mandates the Board to adopt a policy on parent/guardian involvement, applicable to each school that does not receive Title I funds, that is consistent with the purposes and goals in Education Code 11502. See the accompanying administrative regulation for information about these goals and sample strategies for addressing each goal.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement strategies applicable to each school that does not receive federal Title I funds to encourage the involvement and support of parents/guardians in the education of their children, including, but not limited to, strategies describing how the district and schools will address the purposes and goals described in Education Code 11502. (Education Code 11504)
