## Policy Content

The Superintendent or designee shall periodically evaluate the adequacy, design, and conditions of existing District facilities to determine whether they meet the needs of the instructional program and provide a healthful and pleasing environment for students and staff. He/she also shall determine whether District facilities fulfill legal requirements for safety and structural soundness, access for the disabled, and energy conservation.

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall regularly calculate the capacity of existing school buildings to adequately house the District's current students and projected enrollments.

Any identified needs for repair, modernization, or construction shall be incorporated into the District's facilities planning process.

Structural Safety

In the event that the Department of General Services or any licensed structural engineer or licensed architect finds and reports to the Board of Education that a District building is unsafe for use, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately obtain an estimate of the cost of repairs or reconstruction necessary to bring the building up to legal standards for structural safety. The Board shall establish a system of priorities for the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of unsafe school buildings.  (Education Code 17367)

A relocatable school building or structure shall meet the requirements of Education Code 17280-17317 and 17365-17374 pertaining to structural safety. (Education Code 17291)

Energy Efficiency

To the extent that services are available, the Superintendent or designee shall arrange for the energy audit of school buildings to identify the type and amount of work necessary to retrofit buildings and obtain an estimate of projected energy savings. The District may contract with qualified businesses capable of retrofitting these buildings and may borrow funds which do not exceed the amount of energy savings to be accumulated from the improvement of the buildings.  (Education Code 17651-17653)
