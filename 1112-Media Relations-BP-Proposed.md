## Policy Content

The Board of Education respects the public's desire for and right to information and recognizes that the media significantly influence the community's understanding of school programs, student achievement, and school safety.  In order to develop and maintain positive media relations, the Board and Superintendent shall reasonably accommodate media requests for information and provide accurate, reliable, and timely information.

In conjunction with the Superintendent or designee, the Board shall periodically establish priorities and key messages for proactively communicating with the media regarding current District issues, activities, or needs.

Media representatives are welcome at all public Board meetings and shall receive meeting agendas upon request in accordance with Board policy.

Media representatives, like all other visitors, shall register immediately upon entering any school building or grounds when school is in session.

Staff may provide the media with student directory information, as identified in AR 5125.1 - Release of Directory Information, unless the student's parent/guardian has submitted a written request that such information not be disclosed.  The District shall not release other student records or personally identifiable student information that is private or confidential as required by law, Board policy, or administrative regulation.

Interviewing and Photographing Students

The District shall not impose restraints on students' right to speak freely with media representatives.  However, interviewing and photographing students shall not create substantial disruption to the orderly operation of the school or impinge on the rights or safety of students.  Therefore, the District shall encourage media representatives who wish to interview or photograph students at school to make prior arrangements with the principal.

Media Contacts/Spokespersons

The Superintendent or designee shall identify the District's and/or site's primary media contact to whom all media inquiries shall be routed.  Spokespersons designated to speak to the media on behalf of the District include the Board president, Superintendent, public information officer, or District communications director.  Other Board members and/or staff may be asked by the Superintendent or designee to speak to the media on a case-by-case basis, depending on their expertise on an issue or appropriateness given a particular situation.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training on effective media relations to all designated spokespersons.

Crisis Communications Plan

The Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for working with the media to provide timely and accurate information to students, parents/guardians, and the community during a crisis or natural disaster. The crisis communications plan may include, but not be limited to, identification of a media center, strategies for press conference logistics, and development and integration of both internal and external notification systems, including public address systems, social media, web site postings, and text alerts.

The Superintendent or designee shall include local law enforcement, media representatives, and District technology personnel in the crisis planning process.
