## Policy Content

Definitions

Universal precautions are an approach to infection control. All human blood and certain human body fluids, including, but not limited to semen, vaginal secretions, and any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, are treated as if known to be infectious for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and other bloodborne pathogens.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

Occupational exposure means reasonably anticipated contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee's duties.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

A sharp is any object that can be reasonably anticipated to penetrate the skin or any other part of the body and to result in an exposure incident.  (8 CCR 5193)

Infection Control Practices

For the prevention of infectious disease, the district shall:

	Effectively maintain the worksite in a clean and sanitary condition, and implement an appropriate written schedule for cleaning and decontamination of the worksite
	 
	When necessary for employees with occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, provide appropriate personal protective equipment, such as gloves, masks, and outer garments, at no cost to the employee  (8 CCR 5193)
	 
	Provide handwashing facilities which are readily accessible to employees, or, if not feasible, provide an appropriate antiseptic hand cleanser in conjunction with clean cloth or paper towels, or antiseptic towelettes

Any employee who has contact with blood or other body fluid, regardless of whether bloodborne pathogens are known to be present, shall:


	Use personal protective equipment as appropriate.
	 
	Wash hands and other skin surfaces thoroughly with soap and running water:
	 
	
		Immediately or as soon as feasible following contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials
		 
		Immediately after removing gloves or other personal protective equipment
		 
	
	
	When handwashing facilities are not available, use antiseptic hand cleanser in conjunction with clean cloth or paper towels, or antiseptic towelettes. In such instances, hands shall be washed with soap and running water as soon as feasible.
	 
	Refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm, or handling contact lenses in work areas with a reasonable likelihood of occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens.
	 
	Clean and decontaminate all equipment and environmental and work surfaces after contact with blood or other potentially infectious material, no later than the end of the shift or more frequently as required by state regulations.
	 
	Rather than using the hands directly, use mechanical means such as a brush and dust pan, tongs, or forceps to clean up broken glassware which may be contaminated.
	 
	Use effective techniques designed to minimize the risk of a sharps injury in all procedures involving the use of sharps. 
	 
	Handle, store, treat, and dispose of regulated waste in accordance with Health and Safety Code 117600-118360 and other applicable state and federal regulations.
	 
	
		Immediately or as soon as possible after use, contaminated sharps shall be placed in containers meeting the requirements of 8 CCR 5193.
		 
		Specimens of blood or other potentially infectious material shall be placed in a container which prevents leakage during collection, handling, processing, storage, transport, or shipping.
