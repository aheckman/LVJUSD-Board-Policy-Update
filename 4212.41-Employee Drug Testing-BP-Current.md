## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that wish to institute an employee drug testing program.  Federal law contains independent requirements for the drug and alcohol testing of school bus drivers.  See BP/AR 4112.42/4212.42/4312.42 - Drug and Alcohol Testing for School Bus Drivers.
The Governing Board maintains a drug- and alcohol-free workplace.  In accordance with law, all employees shall render service without using, possessing, being impaired by, or being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Pre-Employment Drug/Alcohol Testing for Safety-Sensitive Positions

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that require testing of applicants as part of a pre-employment medical exam given to every job applicant.   Pursuant to Education Code 44839, prior to employing a certificated employee who has not yet held a certificated position in California, a district must require the employee to undergo a physical examination.  Classified employees may also be required to take a pre-employment physical examination as specified in Education Code 45122.  See BP 4112.4/4212.4/4312.4 - Health Examinations.  Because it is a condition of employment, drug testing of current employees would be subject to collective bargaining.In Lanier v. City of Woodburn, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that a city policy requiring all applicants to undergo a pre-employment drug/alcohol test was unconstitutional unless the city could demonstrate that the special needs of the position which required screening, beyond the generalized societal problem of drug use.  Although the California Supreme Court previously held in Loder v. City of Glendale that an across-the-board pre-employment drug testing program is valid when given as part of a pre-employment medical exam required of every job applicant, the more recent 9th Circuit opinion effectively overrules that part of the opinion relative to the types of positions that may be subject to testing.Thus, districts are authorized to institute a pre-employment testing program for those positions for which the district can demonstrate a special need for testing, such as safety-sensitive positions that involve work that may pose a danger to the public and/or require the operation of dangerous equipment.  Examples of "safety-sensitive positions" would likely include school police/security officers or maintenance workers and could also include shop teachers, the school nurse, or staff responsible for distributing student medication, depending on the specific duties of the position.  Whether all teaching or principal positions might qualify as "safety-sensitive" has not been decided in the 9th Circuit, although courts in other circuits have found such testing constitutional since teachers and principals need to ensure the safety of children and teach children the dangers of substance abuse.In Lanier v. City of Woodburn, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that the need for drug/alcohol testing must be specific and substantial and that the governing body must make a specific finding demonstrating the need for testing potential employees in those specific positions.  Thus, in order to provide the necessary justification for the district's program, the district should identify the specific positions and the duties of those positions that necessitate the need for testing in the blanks provided below.  It is strongly recommended that districts consult legal counsel as part of this process
Because students and staff have the right to a safe and secure campus where they are free from physical and psychological harm, the Board authorizes the testing of prospective employees in safety-sensitive positions for drug and alcohol use.  The following positions are safety-sensitive and are subject to the district's program:

Position                                           Safety-Sensitive Duties
____________________________    _______________________________________
____________________________    _______________________________________
____________________________    _______________________________________

Once a conditional offer of employment has been made, prospective employees in these identified positions shall undergo a pre-employment drug and alcohol screening for any substance which could impair their ability to safely and effectively perform their job functions.  This screening shall be part of the employee's pre-employment physical examination.

Final selection of a job applicant for a position shall not be made until the applicant has successfully completed the screening.

All testing and medical examinations shall be conducted in accordance with state and federal law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.

CSBA NOTE: In Lanier v. City of Woodburn, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals did not determine whether the employer could impose a suspicionless drug testing requirement upon every current employee who applies for or is offered a promotion.  However, similar to the requirements imposed by the 9th Circuit for pre-employment testing, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that drug testing as a condition of promotion is permissible only when the testing is justified by the nature of the promotion sought, such as employees who carry firearms.  (National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab)  Therefore, districts wishing to institute a promotional drug testing program must also analyze the functions of the job for which testing is being sought and the specific duties that necessitate testing.  Districts should consult legal counsel before implementing such a program.
