## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the positive benefits of physical activity on student health and academic achievement. The Board desires to provide a physical education program that supports the District's coordinated student wellness program, provides an adequate amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity, builds interest and proficiency in movement skills, and encourages students' lifelong fitness through physical activity. Besides promoting high levels of personal achievement and a positive self-image, physical education activities should teach students how to cooperate in the achievement of common goals.

The Board shall approve the components of the physical education program. The District's program shall be aligned with state model content standards and curriculum frameworks for physical education. It shall provide a developmentally appropriate sequence of instruction which may include, but is not limited to, at appropriate grade levels, the effects of physical activity upon dynamic health, the mechanics of body movement, aquatics, gymnastics and tumbling, individual and dual sports, rhythms and dance, team sports, and combative.

Physical education classes shall be conducted in the coeducational, inclusive manner prescribed by law. The District shall provide instruction in physical education that provides equal access and equal opportunities for participation for all students in grades 1-12 regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, and mental or physical disability.

Physical education staff shall appropriately adjust the amount or type of physical exercise required of students during air pollution episodes, hot weather, or other inclement conditions or as needed to accommodate individual student health needs without academic penalty.

The District's physical education program shall be provided by appropriately credentialed teachers. Continuing professional development may be offered to physical education teachers and to classroom teachers serving as instructors of physical education in order to enhance the quality of instruction and the variety of activities offered.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually administer the physical fitness test designated by the State Board of Education to students in grades 5, 7, and 9. (Education Code 60800)
