An employee may use reasonable and necessary force for self-defense or defense of another person, to quell a disturbance threatening physical injury to others or damage to property, or to obtain possession of weapons or other dangerous objects within the control of a student.  (Education Code 44807, 49001)

An employee shall promptly report to the principal or other immediate supervisor any attack, assault, or physical threat made against the employee by a student or by any other individual in relation to the performance of the employee's duties, and any action the employee took in response.

Additionally, the employee and the principal or other immediate supervisor shall promptly report to local law enforcement authorities an attack, assault, or physical threat made against the employee by a student. Reports of an attack, assault, or physical threat shall be forwarded immediately to the Superintendent or designee.  (Education Code 44014)

Notice Regarding Student Offenses

When a student commits certain offenses that may endanger staff or others, the following procedures shall be implemented to notify staff members as appropriate:

	Acts That Are Grounds for Suspension or Expulsion
	 
	
		The Superintendent or designee shall inform the teacher(s) of each student who, during the previous three school years, has engaged in or is reasonably suspected to have engaged in any act, except the possession or use of tobacco products, that would constitute a ground for suspension or expulsion as specified in Administrative Regulation 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process  (Education Code 49079)
		
		This information shall be based upon District records maintained in the ordinary course of business or records received from a law enforcement agency.  (Education Code 49079)
		 
		Upon receiving a transfer student's record regarding acts committed by the student that resulted in suspension or expulsion, the Superintendent or designee shall inform the student's teacher(s) that the student was suspended from school or expelled from the former District and of the act that resulted in the suspension or expulsion  (Education Code 48201)
		 
		Information received by teacher(s) shall be received in confidence for the limited purpose for which it was provided and shall not be further disseminated by the teacher  (Education Code 48201, 49079)
		 
	
	
	Offenses Reported to the District by a Court
	 
	
		When informed by a court that a minor student has been found by the court to have committed any felony or any misdemeanor involving curfew, gambling, alcohol, drugs, tobacco products, carrying of weapons, a sex offense listed in Penal Code 290, assault or battery, larceny, vandalism, or graffiti, the Superintendent or designee shall expeditiously notify the school principal or designee  (Welfare and Institutions Code 827)
		 
		The principal or designee shall expeditiously disseminate this information to any counselor who directly supervises or reports on the student's behavior or progress and to any teacher or administrator directly supervising or reporting on the student's behavior or progress whom the principal or designee thinks may need the information in order to work with the student appropriately, to avoid being needlessly vulnerable, or to protect others from vulnerability  (Welfare and Institutions Code 827)
		 
		Any court-initiated information that a teacher, counselor, or administrator receives shall be kept confidential and used only to rehabilitate the student and protect other students and staff  (Welfare and Institutions Code 827)
		
		The information shall be further disseminated only when communication with the student, parent/guardian, law enforcement staff, and probation officer is necessary to rehabilitate the student or to protect students and staff.  (Welfare and Institutions Code 827)
		 
		When a student is removed from school as a result of an offense, the Superintendent shall hold the court's information in a separate confidential file until the student is returned to the District  (Welfare and Institutions Code 827)
		
		If the student is returned to a different District, the Superintendent shall transmit the information provided by the student's parole or probation officer to the superintendent of the new District of attendance.  (Welfare and Institutions Code 827)
		 
		Any confidential file of court-initiated information shall be kept until the student becomes 18, graduates from high school, or is released from juvenile court jurisdiction, whichever occurs first, and shall then be destroyed  (Welfare and Institutions Code 827)
	
	

In order to maintain confidentiality when providing information about student offenses to a counselor or teacher, the principal or designee shall send the staff member a written notification that a student has committed an offense that requires review of a student's file in the school office. This notice shall not name or otherwise identify the student. The staff member shall initial the notification and shall also initial the student's file when reviewing it in the school office.

Accommodations for Victims of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, Stalking, or Other Qualifying Acts of Violence

When requested by an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other qualifying acts of violence, the District shall provide the employee reasonable accommodations which may include the implementation of safety measures, including, but not limited to:  (Government Code 12945.8)

	A transfer, reassignment, or modified schedule
	 
	A changed work telephone or work station, including the permission to carry a telephone at work

	Assistance in documenting domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other qualifying act of violence that occurs in the workplace
	 
	Referral to a victim assistance organization
	 
	Another safety procedure or adjustment to a job structure, workplace facility, or work requirement in response to domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other qualifying act of violence

The Superintendent or designee shall engage in a timely, good faith, and interactive process with the employee to determine effective reasonable accommodations that do not pose an undue hardship on the District. In determining whether an accommodation is reasonable, the Superintendent or designee shall consider any exigent circumstance or danger facing the employee or their family member.  (Government Code 12945.8)

Upon the request of the Superintendent or designee, an employee requesting a reasonable accommodation shall provide a written statement, signed by the employee or an individual acting on the employee's behalf, certifying that the accommodation is for an authorized purpose. The Superintendent or designee may also request that the employee provide certification of the employee's status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other qualifying act of violence. Such certification may include:  (Government Code 12945.8)

	A police report indicating that the employee, or a family member of the employee, was a victim
	 
	A court order protecting or separating the employee, or family member of the employee, from the perpetrator of the crime or abuse, or other evidence from the court or prosecuting attorney that the employee has appeared in court
	 
	Documentation from a licensed medical professional or health care provider, domestic violence or sexual assault counselor, victim advocate, or counselor that the employee, or family member of the employee, was undergoing treatment or receiving services for physical or mental injuries or abuse resulting in victimization from the crime or abuse
	 
	Any other form of documentation that reasonably verifies that the crime or abuse occurred, including, but not limited to, a written statement signed by the employee or by an individual acting on the employee's behalf

Any verbal or written statement, police or court record, or other documentation identifying an employee, or a family member of the employee, as a victim shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed by the District except as required by federal or state law or as necessary to protect the employee's safety in the workplace. The employee shall be notified before any authorized disclosure.  (Government Code 12945.8)

Every six months after the date of the certification, the Superintendent or designee may request recertification of the employee's status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, other specified offense, or ongoing circumstances related to the crime or abuse. The employee shall notify the Superintendent or designee if, due to changing circumstances, the employee needs a new accommodation or no longer needs an accommodation. If a new accommodation is needed, the Superintendent or designee shall follow the procedures described above when making the initial determination regarding effective reasonable accommodations.  (Government Code 12945.8)

The District shall not discharge or retaliate against an employee because of the employee's status as a victim of crime or abuse or for requesting a reasonable accommodation, regardless of whether the request was granted.  (Government Code 12945.8)
