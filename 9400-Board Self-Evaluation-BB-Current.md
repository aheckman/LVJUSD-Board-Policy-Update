## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional bylaw may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board shall annually conduct a self-evaluation in order to demonstrate accountability to the community and ensure that district governance effectively supports student achievement and the attainment of the district's vision and goals.

The evaluation may address any area of Board responsibility, including, but not limited to, Board performance in relation to vision setting, curriculum, personnel, finance, policy development, collective bargaining, community relations, and advocacy. The evaluation may also address objectives related to Board meeting operations, relationships among Board members, relationship with the Superintendent, understanding of Board and Superintendent roles and responsibilities, communication skills, or other governance or boardsmanship skills.

The Board shall evaluate itself as a whole. Individual Board members are also expected to use the evaluation process as an opportunity to assess and set goals for their own personal performance.

CSBA NOTE: CSBA offers an online self-evaluation tool which can be accessed and completed electronically through the CSBA web site. Electronically generated results identifying areas of strength and growth are available to the district within a few days of completion by all Governing Board members.
Each year, the Board, with assistance from the Superintendent, shall determine an evaluation method or instrument that measures key components of board responsibility and previously identified performance objectives. Visual and/or audio recordings of a Board meeting may only be used as an evaluation tool when consent is given by all Board members.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54962, the Board may hold a closed session only for purposes expressly authorized by the Brown Act (Government Code 54950-54963) or by a provision of the Education Code. Neither code authorizes closed session discussions for the purpose of board self-evaluations; see BB 9321 - Closed Session Purposes and Agendas. Government Code 54957, which authorizes closed sessions for personnel matters such as evaluations, specifically excludes elected officers or members of a legislative body.
Any discussion involving the Board's self-evaluation shall be conducted in open session.

CSBA NOTE: CSBA representatives are available to facilitate board self-evaluations and workshops that include the use of CSBA's self-evaluation tool. Boards that use a facilitator other than a CSBA representative should note that there is a proprietary right attached to CSBA's self-evaluation tool.
At the request of the Board, a facilitator may be used to assist with the evaluation process. The Board may invite the Superintendent or other individual(s) with pertinent information to provide input into the evaluation process.

Following the evaluation, the Board shall set goals, define and/or refine protocols, and establish priorities and objectives for the following year's evaluation. The Board shall also develop strategies for strengthening Board performance based on identified areas of need, including, but not limited to, Board trainings such as those offered by the California School Boards Association.
