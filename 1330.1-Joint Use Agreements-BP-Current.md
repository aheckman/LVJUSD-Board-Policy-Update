## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that elect to establish formal agreements with public or private entities to jointly use either school facilities or community facilities in order to share costs and risks. In adopting policy on this topic, districts are encouraged to review CSBA's policy brief Maximizing Opportunities for Physical Activity Through Joint Use of Facilities and CSBA's publication Building Healthy Communities: A School Leader's Guide to Collaboration and Community Engagement for tips regarding successful collaboration, information about funding sources for joint use, suggested components of joint use agreements, model agreements, and additional resources.Use of school facilities by the community also may be accomplished through the Civic Center Act (Education Code 38130-38138) and programs such as the After School Education and Safety Program (Education Code 8482-8484.6) and 21st Century Community Learning Centers (20 USC 7171-7176; Education Code 8484.7-8484.9); see BP/AR 1330 - Use of School Facilities and BP/AR 5148.2 - Before/After School Programs.
In order to ensure the efficient use of public resources and increase access to needed services, the Governing Board may enter into an agreement with any public agency, public institution, and/or community organization to use community facilities for school programs or to make school facilities or grounds available for use by those entities. Such an agreement shall be based on an assessment of student and community needs and may be designed to increase access to spaces for recreation and physical activity, library services, school health centers, preschool programs, child care centers, before- or after-school programs, or other programs that benefit students and the community.

When it is determined that joint use of facilities is in the best interest of the district and community, the Superintendent or designee shall identify a potential partner agency, institution, or organization.  He/she shall involve that partner, appropriate district and school staff, and community members in establishing planning processes, goals and priorities for joint use, locations where programs or facilities are most needed, and protocols for ongoing communication and coordination between the partners.

The Superintendent or designee shall work with the partner agency, institution, or organization to develop a written site-specific joint use agreement that delineates the terms and conditions for joint use of the district or community facilities and the responsibilities of all parties.  As appropriate, the agreement may address:

	The underlying philosophy or reasons for entering into the joint use agreement
	 
	The specific district or community facilities or grounds that will be made available to the other party and areas that will be restricted
	 
	Priorities for use of the property
	 
	Hours that the property will be available for use by the district, the partner, or other parties
	 
	Projected capital costs, if any, and operating costs
	 
	Resources to be allocated by the district and the partner
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 38134 authorizes the district to charge a facilities usage fee to nonprofit organizations that promote youth and school activities, provided that the amount does not exceed the district's direct costs and that the Governing Board first adopts a policy specifying which activities will be charged the fee. See BP 1330 - Use of School Facilities for language implementing this mandate.
	Rental or other fees, if any, to be charged to either party or third parties using the facilities
	 
	Responsibilities for management, scheduling, maintenance, on-site supervision, accounting, and other operations
	 
	Procedures and timelines for requesting use of the facilities
	 
	Code of conduct for users of the facilities and consequences for violations of the code
	 
	Provision for regular inspection and notification of damage, as well as restitution and repair of property
	 
	Safety and security measures
	
	CSBA NOTE: In general, the California Tort Claims Act, also known as the Government Claims Act, (Government Code 814-825.6, 830-840.6) protects the district against liability for injuries to individuals using school property, although some conditions or circumstances could result in the district being held liable in the event of an injury. Education Code 38134 requires the district to bear the cost of insuring and defending itself against any risk caused by the district's negligence in the ownership and maintenance of district property. Education Code 38134 also requires any organized group using the facilities to carry insurance and to defend itself in the event of any injuries arising from the group's negligence in the use of the facility. See AR 1330 - Use of School Facilities. CSBA's policy brief Maximizing Opportunities for Physical Activity Through Joint Use of Facilities recommends that districts minimize liability by adequately maintaining the property, ensuring they have proper insurance, requiring that organized groups who use the property maintain the proper insurance, and, when feasible, sharing or passing on the risk to the partner through an indemnity clause in the joint use agreement. The district should consult its legal counsel, joint powers authority or insurance carrier, and/or risk manager regarding potential risks and liability prior to entering into a joint use agreement.
	Liability, insurance, and risk management issues
	 
	Duration of the agreement, process for amending the agreement, and the bases for canceling or terminating the agreement before the expiration date
	 
	Process for resolving disputes regarding any aspect of the agreement
	 
	How any equipment purchased or other investments made through the agreement will be disposed of at the termination of the agreement


The agreement shall be reviewed by legal counsel and approved by the Board.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph should be revised to reflect indicators that will be used to evaluate program effectiveness as agreed upon by the Board and Superintendent and/or program partner.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide regular reports to the Board regarding progress toward project goals, including, but not limited to, levels of participation in joint use programs held at school or community facilities, feedback from program participants, and any report of damage to property or harm to individuals resulting from the joint use.  As needed, the Superintendent or designee shall recommend amendments to the joint use agreement.
