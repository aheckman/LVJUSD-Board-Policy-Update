## Policy Content

The Board of Education shall fix the length of the school day in accordance with law.  (Education Code 46100)

At each school, the length of the school day shall be the same for all students, except as otherwise permitted by law. For any student with a disability, the length of the school day shall be as specified in the student's individualized education program or Section 504 plan.

Unless there is a field trip or other educational program, the daily schedule for grades K-6 shall include at least one or more periods of recess of at least 30 minutes on regular instructional days and 15 minutes on early release days. During this time, students shall be provided supervised opportunities, outdoors when weather and air quality permit unless space is not sufficient in which case recess may be held indoors, to engage in unstructured physical activity, play, organized games, and/or social engagement with peers, and may be provided a snack.  (Education Code 49056)

Educational Program means the entire school-sponsored offering for students, including in-class and out-of-class activities.  (Education Code 49056)

In establishing the daily instructional schedule for each secondary school, the Superintendent or designee shall give consideration to course requirements and curricular demands, availability of school facilities and equipment, and applicable legal requirements.

The Board encourages flexibility in scheduling so as to provide longer time blocks or class periods when appropriate and desirable to support student learning, provide more intensive study of core academic subjects or extended exploration of complex topics, and reduce transition time between classes.

Prior to implementing a block or alternative schedule that will allow secondary students to attend school for fewer school days than the total number of school days for which the school is in session, the Board shall consult in good faith, in an effort to reach agreement with the certificated and classified employees of the school, parents/guardians of the students who would be affected by the change, and the community at large. Such consultation shall include at least one public hearing for which the Board shall give adequate notice to the employees and to the parents/guardians of affected students.  (Education Code 46162)
