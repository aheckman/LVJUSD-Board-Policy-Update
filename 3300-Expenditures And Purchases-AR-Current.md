## Policy Content

The purpose of Administrative Regulation 3300 is to allow purchases to be made in a timely and organized manner that provides for essential accountability of District expenditures. These regulations ensure that all purchases are to be done as economically as possible and within the accepted standards of Board Policy and all applicable laws and codes. 

PROCEDURES AND GENERAL INFORMATION

	Make every effort to obtain the maximum value for each dollar expended.
	 
	Comply with all applicable provisions of State and Federal laws governing school District purchasing.
	 
	Establish specifications that are descriptive of materials desired and that are sufficiently broad to promote competitive bidding, yet provide for the quality desired by the school District and as required by law.

	Purchase without favor or prejudice.

Only authorized individuals appointed by the Board of Education may financially obligate the Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District.

	Gambling
	 
	Any insurance coverage that replicates District Insurance
	 
	Court costs, fines, bail, or bond payments
	 
	Personal expenses – expenditures for any type of personal benefit. e.g., gifts, maintenance, or fuel for personal vehicles (even if the personal vehicle is used for District business), etc.
	 
	Any other payments that conflict with federal, state, or local regulations, or District policy 

The following types of expenditures are regulated and have additional guidelines to be met prior to purchase 


	Purchases of food and snacks must adhere to the District Wellness Policy.
	 
	Purchases of healthy food/ beverages for meetings: Healthy food/beverages can be provided within the following guidelines as long as purchases are reasonable and necessary:
	 
	
		Healthy beverages/light snacks can be provided for parent meetings less than 4 hours in duration. 
		 
		Healthy beverages/light snacks can be provided for training or professional development events of more than 3 hours in duration. 
		 
		Healthy food/ beverages can be provided for meetings, training, or professional development events of 4-hours or more in duration that extend over a regular meal period; or are agendized meetings that begin by 5 PM and/or extend across the typical dinner period. The following requirements  apply:  
		 
		
			Preference shall be given to District Culinary Arts Programs. Should they not be available,  outside vendors may be used.  
			 
			Working meals must be identified on the agenda, and accompanied by a roster and sign-in sheets of all those who were present. The agenda, roster, and sign-ins must be kept on file.

		All furniture purchases

All funds received by the District are considered public funds and must be used to support the educational mission of the District. The best test to use when determining whether the expenditure is appropriate is called the “public scrutiny test.” The test is simple and merely asks whether the tax-paying public would view the expenditure as necessary to support public education. Common unallowable expenditures: gifts, charitable donations, rewards, and staff parties/ celebrations. In certain circumstances, some of these items may be allowable as long as they are in compliance with federal, state, and local regulations and District Policy. 

All requisitions should include an attachment with the description, including the specification and price of the items to be purchased. 

Employee Reimbursements

Employee reimbursements should only be used when it is not feasible to use the Purchase Order/Requisition process.  Claims must be approved by the employee’s immediate supervisor and include a rationale for not using the Purchase Order/Requisition process.

Reimbursement claims shall be prepared on the appropriate District reimbursement form and accompanied by itemized receipts. Only reimbursable expenses should be listed on the receipt (no “cross-outs”). For travel reimbursement see Administrative Regulation 3350.

All claims for reimbursement must be submitted within 60 days after the expenditure occurred. Failure to file a claim for reimbursement on time may result in a denial of the reimbursement request.  No reimbursement will be approved or processed for expenses incurred during the fiscal year that has closed.  In addition, reimbursement requests must adhere to the following - 

	Limit per receipt -- $150 (Splitting orders is not allowed)
	 
	Personal items shall not be included.
	 
	Receipts must include a form of payment.
	 
	Purchases with Gift Cards or Reward points will not be reimbursed.
	 
	Claims are for LVJUSD employees only
	 
	Items must be shipped to the school site or department.
	 
	Any items mistakenly shipped to another location require a Receipt of Goods form approved by site/department administration.
	 
	Claims are to be submitted when items are ‘Shipped’ and ‘Received’ (online purchases require a final invoice showing date shipped or delivered)
	 
	Claims must be submitted within 60 days of purchase
	 
	Receipts must be itemized and attached.
	 
	Charitable donations are not reimbursable.
	 
	Gifts and personal items are not reimbursable.
	 
	Food item purchases must adhere to the LVJUSD Wellness Policy.

Any employee who incurs expenses on behalf of the District, contrary to District policy and/or administrative regulation, shall remain personally liable for payments due as a result of such unauthorized purchase and may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 

Purchasing Responsibilities


	Prepare and keep up-to-date a catalog listing of all standard supplies. The catalog shall promote and will be built around the principles of simplification and standardization.
	 
	Expedite the disposal of all surplus, obsolete, or scrap material.
