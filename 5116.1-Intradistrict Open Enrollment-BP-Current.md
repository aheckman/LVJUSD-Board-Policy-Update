## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35160.5 mandates that the Governing Board establish an open enrollment policy within the district for residents of the district. This requirement does not apply to districts with only one school or with schools that do not serve any of the same grade levels.
The Governing Board desires to provide enrollment options that meet the diverse needs and interests of district students and parents/guardians, while also maximizing the efficient use of district facilities and resources. The Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures for the selection and transfer of students among district schools in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35160.5 mandates that the district's intradistrict open enrollment policy contain the following provision.
The parents/guardians of any student who resides within district boundaries may apply to enroll their child in any district school, regardless of the location of their residence within the district.  (Education Code 35160.5)

The Board shall annually review this policy.  (Education Code 35160.5, 48980)

Enrollment Priorities

No student currently residing within a school's attendance area shall be displaced by another student transferring from outside the attendance area.  (Education Code 35160.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following list of intradistrict enrollment priorities should be modified to reflect district practice. Districts must establish priority for circumstances under which the district is required by state or federal law to offer intradistrict enrollment opportunities (items #1-4 below).  Anticipated need for these transfers should be considered in determining capacity of district schools for other intradistrict transfers allowed by the district pursuant to items #5-7 below.
The Superintendent or designee shall grant priority for the enrollment of a student in a district school outside of the student's attendance area, if the student:

	Is enrolled in a district school designated by the California Department of Education (CDE) as "persistently dangerous"  (20 USC 7912; 5 CCR 11992)
	 
	Is a victim of a violent crime while on school grounds  (20 USC 7912)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 46600, as amended by AB 1127 (Ch. 781, Statutes of 2019), requires a district to approve an intradistrict transfer request for a student who is a victim of bullying, as defined in Education Code 48900.  If the school requested is at maximum capacity and no other district school offers the student's grade level, the student may request an interdistrict transfer and the transfer may not be prohibited by the district; see BP 5117 - Interdistrict Attendance and AR 5131.2 - Bullying. 
	Is a victim of an act of bullying committed by another district student, as determined through an investigation following the parent/guardian's submission of a written complaint with the school, district, or local law enforcement agency pursuant to Education Code 234.1  (Education Code 46600)
	
	If the district school requested by the student is at maximum capacity, the Superintendent or designee shall accept an intradistrict transfer request for another district school.  (Education Code 46600)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #4  is for use by any district whose board has elected, pursuant to 20 USC 6311, to provide the option for intradistrict transfer to all students in a school identified by the California Department of Education (CDE) for comprehensive support and improvement; see BP 0520.1 - Comprehensive and Targeted Support and Improvement.  If the Board allows student transfers on this basis, priority must be given to the lowest achieving students from low-income families, as determined by the district for the purpose of allocating funds to schools pursuant to 20 USC 6313(a)(3).  The district may revise item #4 to reflect the criteria used by the district to identify the lowest achieving students.
	Is currently enrolled in a district school identified by CDE for comprehensive support and improvement, with priority given to the lowest academically achieving students from low-income families as determined pursuant to 20 USC 6313(a)(3)  (20 USC 6311)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35160.5 permits, but does not require, the district's policy to include any or all of the following priorities. Items #5-7 below are optional and should be deleted or modified to reflect enrollment priorities in the district.Education Code 35160.5 makes no provision related to the duration of any transfer granted pursuant to items #5-7. See the accompanying administrative regulation.
	Is experiencing special circumstances that might be harmful or dangerous to the student in the current attendance area, including, but not limited to, threats of bodily harm or threats to the emotional stability of the student. Any such student may transfer to a district school that is at capacity and otherwise closed to transfers. To grant priority under these circumstances, the Superintendent or designee must have received either:  (Education Code 35160.5)
	 
	
		A written statement from a representative of an appropriate state or local agency, including, but not necessarily limited to, a law enforcement official or a social worker, or a properly licensed or registered professional, including, but not necessarily limited to, a psychiatrist, psychologist, marriage and family therapist, clinical social worker, or professional clinical counselor
		 
		A court order, including a temporary restraining order and injunction
		 
	
	
	Is a sibling of another student already attending that school
	 
	Has a parent/guardian whose primary place of employment is that school

Application and Selection Process

CSBA NOTE: The district should specify the intradistrict open enrollment application window, if any, in the blank provided in the following paragraph.
In order to ensure that priorities for enrollment in district schools are implemented in accordance with law and Board policy, applications for intradistrict open enrollment shall be submitted between ______(insert application window dates)____________ of the school year preceding the school year for which the transfer is requested.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35160.5 mandates that the district's intradistrict open enrollment policy contain all the elements listed in the remainder of this section.Education Code 35160.5 requires districts to calculate capacity in a nonarbitrary manner using student enrollment and available space.  The law does not provide a specific formula for the calculation, but the district may want to include unique factors specific to the school to calculate available space, such as class size reduction requirements and space needs for specialized programs. The district may modify the following paragraph to include the specific formula for calculating school capacity for schools within the district.
The Superintendent or designee shall calculate each school's capacity in a nonarbitrary manner using student enrollment and available space.  (Education Code 35160.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35160.5, the district must use a random, unbiased process (e.g., a lottery) to select students for intradistrict open enrollment when requests for admission exceed the capacity of the school.  The California Attorney General (85 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 95 (2002)) has opined that a "first come, first served" selection policy does not constitute a random, unbiased process.An exception in Education Code 35160.5 gives districts the authority to maintain appropriate racial and ethnic balances across district schools.  However, in Crawford v. Huntington Beach Union High School District, a California appellate court held that a district's intradistrict enrollment policy which contained a racial and ethnic balance component as authorized by Education Code 35160.5 was unconstitutional. According to the court, the constitutional provisions added by Proposition 209 prohibit a district from adopting a policy containing different admission criteria on the basis of race. Because of the legal uncertainty surrounding this issue, the following paragraph does not reflect the provisions of Education Code 35160.5 relative to racial and ethnic balance. The district should consult legal counsel regarding any policy or regulation dealing with maintenance of racial or ethnic balance.
Except for the enrollment priorities listed above, the Superintendent or designee shall use a random, unbiased selection process to determine which students shall be admitted whenever a district school receives admission requests that are in excess of the school's capacity.  (Education Code 35160.5)

Enrollment decisions shall not be based on a student's academic or athletic performance. However, existing entrance criteria may be used for enrolling students in specialized schools or programs, provided that the criteria are uniformly applied to all applicants. In addition, academic performance may be used to determine eligibility for, or placement in, programs for gifted and talented students.  (Education Code 35160.5)

Transportation

CSBA NOTE: The following section may be revised to reflect district practice. The district is not obligated to provide transportation for students who are victims of violent criminal offenses or those who wish to transfer out of "persistently dangerous" schools pursuant to 20 USC 7912. If a district chooses to make transportation available to such students, it may use certain federal funds (e.g., Title IV, Part A, and Title V, Part A) to cover the costs. When a district chooses to provide transportation, U.S. Department of Education Guidance (Unsafe School Choice Option) clarifies that the district is not obligated to continue providing or paying for transportation after the school is no longer designated as "persistently dangerous."In addition, pursuant to 20 USC 6311, the district may use up to five percent of its Title I allocation to pay for the transportation of students who transferred out of a school identified by CDE for comprehensive support and improvement.
In general, the district shall not be obligated to provide transportation for students who attend school outside their attendance area.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46600, as amended by AB 1127, the district must provide transportation assistance to a student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals and receives an intradistrict transfer as a result of being a victim of bullying. The district may, but is not required to, provide transportation assistance to any other student who is a victim of bullying. 
However, upon parent/guardian request, the district shall provide transportation assistance to any student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals and whose enrollment in a district school outside the student's attendance area is a result of being a victim of bullying.  (Education Code 46600)

<div id='gNg729' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35160.5, the district must use a random, unbiased process (e.g., a lottery) to select students for intradistrict open enrollment when requests for admission exceed the capacity of the school.  The California Attorney General (85 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 95 (2002)) has opined that a "first come, first served" selection policy does not constitute a random, unbiased process.<br><br>An exception in Education Code 35160.5 gives districts the authority to maintain appropriate racial and ethnic balances across district schools.  However, in Crawford v. Huntington Beach Union High School District, a California appellate court held that a district's intradistrict enrollment policy which contained a racial and ethnic balance component as authorized by Education Code 35160.5 was unconstitutional. According to the court, the constitutional provisions added by Proposition 209 prohibit a district from adopting a policy containing different admission criteria on the basis of race. Because of the legal uncertainty surrounding this issue, the following paragraph does not reflect the provisions of Education Code 35160.5 relative to racial and ethnic balance. The district should consult legal counsel regarding any policy or regulation dealing with maintenance of racial or ethnic balance.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="wMjMMA9" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22wMjMMA9%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22gNg729%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1576519246%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2035160.5%2C%20the%20district%20must%20use%20a%20random%2C%20unbiased%20process%20%28e.g.%2C%20a%20lottery%29%20to%20select%20students%20for%20intradistrict%20open%20enrollment%20when%20requests%20for%20admission%20exceed%20the%20capacity%20of%20the%20school.%20%20The%20California%20Attorney%20General%20%2885%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%2095%20%282002%29%29%20has%20opined%20that%20a%20%5C%22first%20come%2C%20first%20served%5C%22%20selection%20policy%20does%20not%20constitute%20a%20random%2C%20unbiased%20process.%5Cn%5CnAn%20exception%20in%20Education%20Code%2035160.5%20gives%20districts%20the%20authority%20to%20maintain%20appropriate%20racial%20and%20ethnic%20balances%20across%20district%20schools.%20%20However%2C%20in%20Crawford%20v.%20Huntington%20Beach%20Union%20High%20School%20District%2C%20a%20California%20appellate%20court%20held%20that%20a%20district%27s%20intradistrict%20enrollment%20policy%20which%20contained%20a%20racial%20and%20ethnic%20balance%20component%20as%20authorized%20by%20Education%20Code%2035160.5%20was%20unconstitutional.%20According%20to%20the%20court%2C%20the%20constitutional%20provisions%20added%20by%20Proposition%20209%20prohibit%20a%20district%20from%20adopting%20a%20policy%20containing%20different%20admission%20criteria%20on%20the%20basis%20of%20race.%20Because%20of%20the%20legal%20uncertainty%20surrounding%20this%20issue%2C%20the%20following%20paragraph%20does%20not%20reflect%20the%20provisions%20of%20Education%20Code%2035160.5%20relative%20to%20racial%20and%20ethnic%20balance.%20The%20district%20should%20consult%20legal%20counsel%20regarding%20any%20policy%20or%20regulation%20dealing%20with%20maintenance%20of%20racial%20or%20ethnic%20balance.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-wMjMMA9" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35160.5, the..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
