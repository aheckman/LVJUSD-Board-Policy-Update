## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation is for use by districts maintaining middle and/or high schools that provide any of the work-based learning programs authorized by Education Code 51760.1. Pursuant to Education Code 51760.1, students participating in work-based learning programs must be afforded the same statutory and regulatory safeguards, when applicable, as students participating in work experience education (WEE) programs. The district should select the section(s) below that reflect the program(s) available in the district. 
Work Experience Education

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that offer a WEE program pursuant to Education Code 51760.1 and 5 CCR 10070-10075, and may be revised to reflect district practice. Although the WEE programs described in items #1-3 below may enroll students under age 16, such students may only receive credit for general WEE or career technical WEE under the limited circumstances specified in Education Code 51760.3. For further information about the operation of WEE programs, see the California Department of Education's (CDE) Work Experience Education Guide. 
The district's work experience education (WEE) program shall consist of one or more of the following types of unpaid and paid on-the-job experiences:  (5 CCR 10071)

	Exploratory WEE which provides students with a combination of related classroom instruction in WEE and unpaid opportunities to observe and sample systematically a variety of conditions of work for the purpose of ascertaining their interest and suitability for the occupation they are exploring
	
	The length of exploratory WEE assignments may vary depending on the aptitude of the student, the occupation being explored, the facilities of the work station, and the job classification. A student may not participate in an exploratory WEE assignment if he/she receives pay for like work at the same work station or similar job outside of the WEE program.
	 
	General WEE which has as its purpose the application of basic skills of reading, writing, and computation and which provides students an opportunity to acquire general and specific occupational skills through a combination of supervised paid employment in any occupational field and related classroom instruction in WEE
	
	CSBA NOTE: Although 5 CCR 10071 states that career technical WEE provides paid employment opportunities, the CDE's Work Experience Education Guide clarifies that career technical WEE may offer paid or unpaid work experiences. 
	Career technical WEE which reinforces and extends career learning opportunities for students through a combination of related classroom instruction in WEE and supervised paid or unpaid employment in the occupation for which their career technical course in school prepares them

The student-teacher ratio in any WEE program shall not exceed 125 students per full-time equivalent certificated teacher coordinator.  (Education Code 46300)

The minimum day for students enrolled in a WEE program shall be four periods totaling at least 180 minutes in duration, unless the school or student meets one of the conditions specified in Education Code 46144 or 46147.  (Education Code 46144, 46147)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph reflects guidance in the CDE's Work Experience Education Guide. 
A WEE program offered during the summer shall be conducted in the same time period as the regular summer school program and shall conform to all appropriate laws and regulations applicable to WEE.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51764, any WEE program must be coordinated by district staff. 
Each WEE program shall operate under the supervision of a teacher-coordinator. The teacher-coordinator shall make at least two on-site contacts per semester with each work supervisor or at least one on-site contact during summer school to evaluate student performance.  (Education Code 51764; 5 CCR 10074)

Any student who is age 16 years or older and who satisfactorily completes a WEE program with a minimum of one instructional period per week of related classroom instruction or counseling by a certificated employee, in sessions scheduled intermittently throughout the semester, shall be granted up to 40 semester periods of credit for WEE within the following limits:  (Education Code 51760.3; 5 CCR 1635)


	For exploratory WEE, the student may earn 10 semester periods for each semester, with a maximum of 20 semester periods earned in two semesters.
	 
	For either general or career technical WEE, the student may earn 10 semester periods for each semester, with a maximum of 40 semester periods.

Any student who satisfies the above requirements but is under age 16 may be granted credit under any of the following conditions:  (Education Code 51760.3)


	The student is enrolled in grade 11 or higher.
	 
	The principal certifies that the student is in need of immediate work experience education in order to pursue employment opportunities.
	 
	The principal certifies that, without being provided an opportunity to enroll in the WEE program, there is a high probability that the student will no longer be enrolled as a full-time student.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51760.3, as amended by AB 2063 (Ch. 72, Statutes of 2016), provides an additional circumstance under which students under age 16 can receive credit for satisfactory completion of a WEE program, as provided in item #4 below. 
	The student is age 14 years or older and the principal certifies that such credit is necessary for the student's participation in a career technical education (CTE) program.
	 
	The student has an individualized education program (IEP) which prescribes the type of training for which participation in a WEE program is deemed appropriate.

Cooperative Career Technical Education Program/Community Classrooms

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that offer a cooperative career technical education (CTE) program (5 CCR 10100-10111) and/or community classroom program (5 CCR 10080-10090) and should be modified to reflect the program(s) offered by the district. Except where noted, requirements described below apply to either program.  Both the cooperative CTE and community classroom programs require participating students to be concurrently enrolled in a course or program approved by the CDE. Pursuant to 5 CCR 10103, students in the cooperative CTE program are also required to (1) be at least age 16 unless the principal determines that the program is appropriate for a younger student due to his/her financial, motivational, or other exceptional needs; (2) be full-time students as defined; and (3) have parent/guardian consent if under age 18. 
To be eligible for program participation, a student shall be concurrently enrolled in a CTE course or program approved by the California Department of Education and shall meet other criteria specified in 5 CCR 10103 as applicable.  (5 CCR 10082, 10103)

At least one instructional period per week of formal CTE classroom instruction shall be provided to participating students. Each CTE instructional period shall be equivalent to a minimum of three regular classroom instructional periods of at least 50 minutes each week. (5 CCR 10085, 10106)

Teachers assigned to the program shall locate and select training stations to provide participating students with unpaid on-the-job learning experiences in the specific occupation related to the approved course or program.  (5 CCR 10086, 10107)

CSBA NOTE: The district should choose one or both options below reflecting program(s) offered by the district. 
OPTION 1:  (Cooperative CTE Program)

The cooperative CTE program teacher shall make at least one visitation every four weeks to each employer to ensure that the provisions of the training agreement are being met and that students are acquiring the competencies identified in their individual training plans. One out of every two visits to the training station shall include an observation of the student engaged in on-the-job training experiences.  (5 CCR 10109)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Community Classrooms)

The community classroom teacher shall make at least one visitation every three weeks to consult with the work supervisor, observe students at the training station, provide instruction, and ensure that students are acquiring the competencies identified in their individual training plans. Each visitation shall include an observation of the student engaged in on-the-job training experiences.  (5 CCR 10088)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE 

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts offering either the cooperative CTE or community classroom program. 
Students shall be granted academic credit for satisfactory completion of the program. The teacher shall be responsible for evaluating the student's performance in the CTE course and, with the assistance of the employer, the student's participation at the training station.  (5 CCR 10081, 10102)

Job Shadowing

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that offer job shadowing opportunities pursuant to Education Code 51769. The section may be revised to reflect district practice, including specifying the position designated by the Superintendent or designee to coordinate or manage the program. The CDE's Work Experience Education Guide recommends that job shadowing activities be conducted under the supervision of the WEE coordinator. 
The program coordinator shall identify job shadowing placements with the goal of providing students with exposure to a broad range of career options and employment settings.

The program coordinator shall supervise job shadowing activities, including the coordination of the student's and employer's schedules and consultation with the student's other teachers when necessary.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51769, as amended by AB 2063 (Ch. 72, Statutes of 2016), allows students to participate in job shadowing activities for up to 40 hours per semester, intersession, or summer school session under the conditions described below. 
Participating students may attend job shadowing opportunities for up to 25 hours but no less than three hours in one semester, intersession, or summer school session. However, a student may be permitted to participate for up to 40 hours in one semester, intersession, or summer school session, if the principal certifies that it is necessary for the student's participation in a CTE program. (Education Code 51769)
