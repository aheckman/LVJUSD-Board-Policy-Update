## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide a comprehensive program for students who are migratory that attempts to mitigate the impact of educational disruption, cultural and language barriers, social isolation, health-related problems, and other factors that may inhibit their ability to succeed in school. The District shall make use of available funds to provide supplementary services for students who are migratory.

The Superintendent or designee shall cooperate with the regional migrant service center in outreach and identification of eligible students who are migratory and in the provision of migrant education services. The Superintendent or designee shall also coordinate migrant education services with other programs within the District and with other public agencies that serve migrant workers and their families.

The District shall give first priority for services to students who are migratory who are failing, or are most at risk of failing, to meet state academic standards or have dropped out of school.  (20 USC 6394)

The District shall provide services to eligible private school students residing within the District on an equitable basis with participating public school students.  (20 USC 7881; 34 CFR 200.87)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each student who is migratory is placed at the appropriate grade level upon enrollment and is provided services in accordance with an individual needs assessment and learning plan.
