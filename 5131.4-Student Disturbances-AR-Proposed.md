Prohibited Activities

A student involved or attempting to be involved in any of the following prohibited activities shall be subject to discipline:


	Disturbing the peace, including, but not limited to, causing or attempting to cause a riot, burning or destroying property, fighting, challenging another to fight, or using offensive words likely to provoke a fight
	 
	Disrupting school operations, including, but not limited to, exercising free expression which is obscene, libelous, or slanderous or so incites students as to create a clear and present danger of the commission of unlawful acts on school premises or the violation of lawful school regulations, or substantially disrupting the orderly operation of the school (Education Code 48907)
	
	Other examples of activities that may be considered disrupting school operations include, but are not limited to:
	 
	
		Organizing or participating in unauthorized assemblies on school premises
		 
		Participating in sit-ins or stand-ins which deny students or employees normal access to school premises
		 
		Interfering with or unauthorized use of the District's computer system
		 
	
	
	Refusing to disperse, including, but not limited to, assembling for the purpose of causing a disruption and refusing to disperse upon the direction of school personnel
	 
	Boycotting school, including, but not limited to, participating in any protest that involves nonattendance where attendance is required at school, class, or at a school activity


Any student who participates in a boycott shall be given an unexcused absence and may be classified as truant, regardless of any parent/guardian approval of the absence.

Extension of Class Period and/or Dismissal of School

During any disturbance in which additional students might become involved while changing classes, the principal or designee may notify all staff that any class currently in session will be extended until further notice. Upon receiving this notification, staff shall ensure that all students in their charge remain in one location under their supervision and shall ask all students who are in the halls to return to their classes immediately.

The principal may also request that the Superintendent dismiss school in accordance with the school disturbance response plan.
