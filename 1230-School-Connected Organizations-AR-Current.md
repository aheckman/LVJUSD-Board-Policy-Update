## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation should be modified to reflect district practice. Although school-connected organizations are generally separate legal entities and in some cases may be subject to the financial policies and bylaws of a state or national organization, districts have the authority to approve the ability of a school-connected organization to operate within the district or a district school. The Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT), in its 2015 ASB Accounting Manual, Fraud Prevention Guide and Desk Reference, recommends that persons be required to complete an application, containing at least the information reflected in items #1-10 below, in order to form a school-connected organization. A sample application form is available in the FCMAT manual.
A school-connected organization's request for authorization to operate within the district or at a district school shall contain, as appropriate:

	The name and purpose of the organization
	 
	The date of application
	 
	Bylaws, rules, and procedures under which the organization will operate, including procedures for maintaining the organization's finances, membership qualifications, if any, and an agreement that the group will not engage in unlawful discrimination
	 
	The names, addresses, and phone numbers of all officers
	 
	A list of specific objectives
	 
	An agreement to grant the district the right to audit the group's financial records, either by district personnel or a certified public accountant, whenever any concern is raised regarding the use of the funds
	 
	The name of the bank where the organization's account will be located and the names of those authorized to withdraw funds
	 
	The signature of the principal of the supporting school
	 
	Planned use for any money remaining at the end of the year if the organization is not continued or authorized to continue in the future
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 38134 requires school-connected organizations to insure against any liability resulting from the organization's negligence during an organization-sponsored event on school facilities. See BP/AR 1330 - Use of School Facilities.
	An agreement to provide evidence of liability and/or directors and officers insurance when and in the manner required by law

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph requires an organization to request renewal of the authorization from the Superintendent or designee on an annual basis. Districts that allow for an automatic renewal or that require approval from the Governing Board should modify the following paragraph accordingly.
Requests for subsequent authorization shall be annually submitted to the Superintendent or designee, along with a financial statement showing all income and expenditures from fundraisers.  If the Superintendent or designee proposes to deny the request for reauthorization, he/she shall present his/her recommendation to the Governing Board for approval.

When deemed necessary by the Board or the Superintendent or designee, the authorization for a school-connected organization to conduct activities in the district may be revoked at any time.

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-5 below reflect recommendations in FCMAT's 2015 ASB Accounting Manual, Fraud Prevention Guide and Desk Reference and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Each school-connected organization shall abide by the following rules:


	The organization shall not act as an agent of the district or school.
	 
	The organization shall not use the district's tax-exempt status and identification number. It shall be responsible for its own tax status, accounting, internal controls, financial reporting, retention of records, and other operations.
	 
	The organization shall use a separate name and logo. Any use of a name or logo affiliated with the district, a district school, or a school team shall require the prior consent of the Superintendent or designee.
	 
	Funds of the school-connected organization shall not be co-mingled with district funds, including associated student body funds.
	 
	The organization shall not hire or directly pay any district employee. If a school-connected organization wishes to pay for additional and/or extracurricular services, the person to provide the services shall be hired through the district's personnel department, provided the Board approves the position. At their discretion, employees may volunteer to perform activities for school-connected organizations during nonworking hours.
