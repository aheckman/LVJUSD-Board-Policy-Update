## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that effective District governance requires strong collaboration and teamwork with the Superintendent. Because the Board and Superintendent each have their unique roles and responsibilities, both contribute to the responsible governance of the District and the quality of education provided to the community's students.

The Superintendent is expected to hold himself/herself to the highest standards of ethical conduct and professionalism.

To support the Board in the governance of the District, the Superintendent:


	Promotes the success of all students and supports the efforts of the Board to keep the District focused on learning and achievement
	 
	Values, advocates and supports public education and all stakeholders
	 
	Recognizes and respects the differences of perspective and style on the Board and among staff, students, parents/guardians and the community and ensures that the diverse range of views inform Board decisions
	 
	Acts with dignity, treats everyone with civility and respect, and understands the implications of demeanor and behavior
	 
	Serves as a model for the value of lifelong learning and supports the Board's continuous professional development
	 
	Works with the Board as a "governance team" and assures collective responsibility for building a unity of purpose, communicating a common vision and creating a positive organizational culture
	 
	Recognizes that the Board/Superintendent governance relationship is supported by the management team in the District
	 
	Understands the distinctions between Board and staff roles, and respects the role of the Board as the representative of the community
	 
	Understands that authority rests with the Board as a whole; provides guidance to the Board to assist in decision-making; and provides leadership based on the direction of the Board as a whole
	 
	Communicates openly with trust and integrity, including providing all members of the Board with equal access to information and recognizing the importance of both responsive and anticipatory communications
	 
	Accepts leadership responsibility and accountability for implementing the vision, goals and policies of the District
