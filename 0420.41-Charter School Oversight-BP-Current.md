## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. The Governing Board is required to oversee any charter school it authorizes. This oversight is to ensure the school's compliance with legal requirements and the charter. Additionally, pursuant to Education Code 47604, if the district complies with all oversight responsibilities required by law, it will not be liable for the debts or obligations of any charter school that operates as or is operated by a nonprofit public benefit corporation pursuant to Corporations Code 5110-6910.For guidance when determining whether to grant a renewal of the charter or whether a revocation of the charter is warranted, see BP 0420.42 - Charter School Renewal and BP 0420.43 - Charter School Revocation.Pursuant to Education Code 47605, if the State Board of Education (SBE) approves a petition upon appeal after the Board and County Board of Education have denied the petition, SBE is required to designate, in consultation with the petitioner, either the Board or the County Board as the chartering authority.
The Governing Board recognizes its ongoing responsibility to oversee that any charter school authorized by the Board is successfully fulfilling the terms of its charter.

The Superintendent or designee shall identify at least one staff member to serve as a contact person for each charter school authorized by the Board.  (Education Code 47604.32)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47604.32 requires the district to visit each charter school at least once every year. CSBA's publication, "Charter Schools: A Guide for Governance Teams," recommends more frequent visits in order to monitor school operations more closely and develop relationships with the staff at the school.
The Superintendent or designee shall visit each charter school at least annually and may inspect or observe any part of a charter school at any time.  (Education Code 47604.32, 47607)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47604, if a charter school operates as or is operated by a nonprofit public benefit corporation, the Board is entitled to appoint a single representative to the board of directors of the nonprofit public benefit corporation. It is recommended that the Board not appoint a district employee or a Board member to the nonprofit's board. Districts that seek to appoint a representative are advised to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel regarding any potential conflict of interest that may arise. Additionally, as an alternative to appointing a member to the nonprofit's board, CSBA's Guide suggests that the district designate its charter school contact, appointed pursuant to Education Code 47604.32, to simply attend meetings of the nonprofit's board.
The Superintendent may designate someone to attend meetings of the charter school governing body whenever possible.

Monitoring Charter School Performance

CSBA NOTE: The district has a responsibility to oversee that the charter school complies with all applicable legal requirements. Violation of any law may subject the charter school to revocation pursuant to Education Code 47607. See the accompanying Exhibit for a list of legal requirements pertaining to the operation of charter schools.
Any charter school authorized by the Board shall be monitored by the Superintendent or designee to determine whether the charter school complies with all legal requirements applicable to charter schools, including all reports required of charter schools by law, as specified in Education Code 47604.32. Any violations of law shall be reported to the Board.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47605 requires that measurable student outcomes for all students of the charter school, including numerically significant student subgroups as defined in Education Code 52052, be included in the school's charter petition and that these outcomes be aligned with the state priorities for the local control and accountability plan (LCAP) as stated in Education Code 52060; see AR 0420.4 - Charter School Authorization. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, numerically significant subgroups include ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and homeless students, when the subgroup consists of at least 30 students (or at least 15 foster youth or homeless students) in the school.Education Code 47605 requires that the charter petition include methods for measuring the charter school's progress toward achieving student outcomes. Although the measures of the school's progress may vary, Education Code 47605 requires that charter schools conduct any statewide assessments applicable to other public schools. In addition, charter schools are included in the California School Dashboard, which reports the status of school performance on multiple state and local indicators and is intended to assist schools and districts in identifying strengths and areas in need of improvement in each priority area addressed by the LCAP. Charter schools that serve high-risk students may qualify for the state's Dashboard Alternative School Status program, which uses modified methods of measurement for accountability indicators when appropriate.
The Board shall monitor each charter school to determine whether it is achieving the measurable student outcomes set forth in the charter, both schoolwide and for each numerically significant student subgroup served by the school as defined in Education Code 52052. This determination shall be based on the measures specified in the approved charter and any applicable MOU, and on the charter school's annual review and assessment of its progress toward the goals and actions identified in its local control and accountability plan (LCAP), as reported in the California School Dashboard.

The Board shall monitor the fiscal condition of the charter school based on any financial report or information obtained from the charter school, including, but not limited to, the charter school's preliminary budget, LCAP and annual update of the charter school's LCAP, first and second interim financial reports, and final unaudited report for the full prior year.  (Education Code 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5)

Waivers

CSBA NOTE: A charter school is not authorized to submit general waiver requests to SBE on its own behalf, unless an exception applies. Rather, a charter school may submit a waiver request through the district. A general waiver request form is available on the California Department of Education's (CDE) website. See BP 1431 - Waivers.
If the charter school wishes to request a general waiver of any state law or regulation applicable to it, it shall request that the Board approve and the district submit a general waiver request to the State Board of Education (SBE) on its behalf. Upon approval of the Board, the Superintendent or designee shall submit such a waiver request to SBE on behalf of the charter school.

Provision of District Services

CSBA NOTE: CSBA's Guide recommends one or more memoranda of understanding to clarify any financial and operational agreements between the district and the charter school, including any services that will be provided by the district; see BP 0420.4 - Charter School Authorization.
Upon approval by the Board of an appropriate agreement, the charter school may contract with the district or any other source for administrative or other services.  (Education Code 47613)

Whenever the district agrees to provide administrative or support services to a charter school, the district and the charter school shall develop a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which clarifies the financial and operational agreements between them.

At the request of a charter school, the Superintendent or designee shall create and submit any reports required by the State Teachers' Retirement System or Public Employees' Retirement System on behalf of the charter school. The district may charge the charter school for the actual costs of the reporting services, but shall not require the charter school to purchase payroll processing services from the district as a condition for creating and submitting these reports.  (Education Code 47611.3)

Material Revisions to Charter

Material revisions to a charter may only be made with Board approval. Material revisions shall be governed by the same standards and criteria that apply to petitions for the authorization of charter schools as set forth in Education Code 47605 and shall include, but not be limited to, a reasonably comprehensive description of any new requirement for charter schools enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed.  (Education Code 47607)

The Board shall determine whether a proposed change in charter school operations would constitute a material revision of the approved charter.

If an approved charter school proposes to expand operations to one or more additional sites or grade levels, whether concurrently with or unrelated to a renewal, the charter school shall request a material revision to its charter and shall notify the Board of those additional locations or grade levels. The Board shall consider approval of the additional locations or grade levels at an open, public meeting.  (Education Code 47605, 47607)

The Board may deny a proposed material revision if it finds that the proposed material revision would render the charter school demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in which the school is located or proposes to locate. In making this finding, the Board shall consider all of the following:  (Education Code 47605)

	The fiscal impact of the proposed expansion on the district
	 
	The extent to which the expansion would substantially undermine existing services, academic offerings, or programmatic offerings
	 
	Whether the expansion would duplicate a program currently offered within the district that has sufficient capacity for the students proposed to be served within reasonable proximity to where the charter school intends to locate

Additionally, the Board may deny a proposed material revision if it finds that the district is not positioned to absorb the fiscal impact of the proposed material revision. The Board shall make this finding if the district has a qualified interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131 and the County Superintendent of Schools, in consultation with the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, certifies that approving the charter school would result in the district having a negative interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131,  the district has a negative interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131, or the district is under state receivership.  (Education Code 47605)

Location of Charter Schools

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47605 and 47605.1 establish geographic and site requirements for charter schools. Pursuant to Education Code 47605, a charter school must be located within the geographic boundaries of the authorizing district. However, Education Code 47605 permits the location of some charter schools outside of the authorizing district's boundaries under specified conditions. For example, a charter school in operation before October 1, 2019, on a federally recognized California reservation or rancheria or operated by a federally recognized California Indian tribe is exempted from the geographic restrictions of Education Code 47605.1.  For information about geographic and site requirements for new charter schools, see AR 0420.4 - Charter School Authorization.
Except when permitted to operate outside district boundaries pursuant to Education Code 47605 and 47605.1, a charter school shall be located within district boundaries.

Fees/Charges for Supervisorial Oversight

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47613 authorizes the district to charge the charter school, within specified limits, for the costs of supervisorial oversight of the school. Education Code 47613 provides that the costs of supervisorial oversight include, but are not limited to, costs incurred for technical assistance or intervention pursuant to Education Code 47607.3; see "Technical Assistance/Intervention" below. CSBA's Guide suggests that supervisorial oversight activities also might include site visits and site visit protocols, development of memorandums of understanding, reviews of performance data and financial reports, review of governance procedures, monitoring of teacher credentialing and assignments, facilities compliance, and legal auditing.
The district may charge for district supervisorial oversight as follows:  (Education Code 47613; 5 CCR 11969.7)

	Actual costs up to one percent of the charter school's revenue
	 
	Actual costs up to three percent of the charter school's revenue if the district provides the charter school substantially rent-free facilities
	
	If the district provides the charter school with facilities under Education Code 47614 and charges the charter school a pro-rata share of the facilities costs calculated pursuant to 5 CCR 11969.7, the district may only charge the charter school for the actual costs of supervisorial oversight up to one percent of the charter school's revenue.
	 
	Actual costs if the district is assigned supervisorial oversight responsibility for the charter school by SBE when authorized on appeal

Technical Assistance/Intervention

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47607.3 establishes criteria for the provision of technical assistance to charter schools including, but not limited to, the option to request assistance from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence (CCEE). If, after providing technical assistance, the CCEE informs the Board that the charter school has failed or is unable to implement CCEE's recommendations or continues to have persistent or acute inadequate performance, then the Board must consider revocation of the charter; see BP 0420.43 - Charter School Revocation.
Whenever a charter school is identified for technical assistance based on the performance of one or more numerically significant student subgroups on SBE-established criteria, the charter school shall receive technical assistance from the County Superintendent. Such technical assistance shall be focused on building the charter school's capacity to develop and implement actions and services responsive to student and community needs, including, but not limited to, any of the following:  (Education Code 47607.3)

	Assisting the charter school to identify its strengths and weaknesses in regard to the state priorities applicable to the charter school pursuant to Education Code 47605(c)
	
	This shall include working collaboratively with the charter school to review performance data on the state and local indicators included in the California School Dashboard and other relevant local data and to identify effective, evidence-based programs or practices that address any areas of weakness.
	 
	Working collaboratively with the charter school to secure assistance from an academic, programmatic, or fiscal expert or team of experts to identify and implement effective programs and practices that are designed to improve performance in any areas of weakness identified by the charter school
	
	Another service provider, including, but not limited to, a school district, county office of education, or charter school, may be solicited to act as a partner to the charter school in need of technical assistance.
	 
	Obtaining from the charter school timely documentation demonstrating that it has completed the activities described in Items #1 and 2 or substantially similar activities, or has selected another service provider to work with the charter school to complete the activities described in Items #1 and 2 or substantially similar activities, and ongoing communication with the Board to assess the charter school's progress in improving student outcomes

In addition, if, in three out of four consecutive school years, a charter school fails to improve outcomes for three or more numerically significant student subgroups, or for all of the student subgroups if the school has fewer than three subgroups, in regard to one or more state or school priorities identified in the charter, the County Superintendent may request that the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI), with SBE approval, assign the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to provide advice and assistance to the charter school pursuant to Education Code 52074.  (Education Code 47607.3; 52072)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47607 requires the Board to consider specified criteria of academic performance when determining whether to deny a petition for charter renewal or to revoke a charter, with achievement of all student subgroups served by the charter school being the most important factor; see BP 0420.42 - Charter School Renewal and BP 0420.43 - Charter School Revocation. In addition, Education Code 47607.3 requires the Board to consider revocation of a charter whenever it finds that the charter school has failed, or is unable, to implement the recommendations of CCEE or continues to demonstrate persistent or acute inadequate performance.
In accordance with law, the Board may deny a charter school's renewal petition or may revoke a charter based on the charter school's poor performance, especially with regard to inadequate academic achievement of all numerically significant subgroups of students served by the charter school.  (Education Code 47607, 47607.2)

Complaints

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52075, charter schools are required to establish policies and procedures for addressing complaints of noncompliance with Education Code 47606.5 (annual update of school goals, actions, and related expenditures) or 47607.3 (technical assistance or intervention based on the school's failure to improve student outcomes). See AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures for applicable procedures.
Each charter school shall establish and maintain policies and procedures in accordance with the uniform complaint procedures as specified in 5 CCR 4600-4670 to enable any person alleging the school's noncompliance with Education Code 47606.5 or 47607.3 to file a complaint with the charter school.  (Education Code 52075)

A complaint may be filed anonymously if the complaint provides evidence or information leading to evidence to support an allegation of noncompliance. A complainant who is not satisfied with the decision may appeal the decision to the SPI.  (Education Code 52075)

If the charter school finds merit in the complaint or the SPI finds merit in an appeal, a remedy shall be provided to all affected students and parents/guardians.  (Education Code 52075)

School Closure

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47605, procedures to be followed in the event a charter school ceases operation for any reason must be specified in the charter; see AR 0420.4 - Charter School Authorization. 5 CCR 11962 lists components that must be included in these procedures, including (1) designation of a responsible entity to conduct closure-related activities, (2) notifications to specified persons and entities, (3) provision of information about students' grade level, course completion, and district of residence, (4) transfer and maintenance of student and personnel records, (5) completion of an independent final audit, (6) disposal of any net assets remaining after all liabilities of the charter school have been paid or otherwise addressed, (7) completion and filing of any annual reports required pursuant to Education Code 47604.33, and (8) identification of funding for the activities identified in 1-7.Depending on the terms of the charter, these duties may be performed by the charter school, the district, or another specified entity. However, Education Code 47604.32 specifies that it is the responsibility of the district to notify CDE when a charter school ceases operation for any reason. CSBA's Guide recommends that, in addition to the notifications required by 5 CCR 11962, either the district or the charter school should announce the closure to any school districts that may be responsible for providing education services to the former students of the charter school.
In the event that the Board revokes or denies renewal of a charter or the charter school ceases operation for any reason, the Superintendent or designee shall, when applicable in accordance with the charter school and/or an  applicable agreement between the district and the charter school, provide assistance to facilitate the transfer of the charter school's former students and to finalize financial reporting and close-out of the charter school.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide notification to the California Department of Education, within 10 calendar days of the Board's action, if renewal of a charter is denied, a charter is revoked, or a charter school will cease operation for any reason. Such notification shall include, but not be limited to, a description of the circumstances of the closure, the effective date of the closure, and the location of student and personnel records.  (Education Code 47604.32; 5 CCR 11962.1)

It is recommended that the Board not appoint a district employee or a Board member to the nonprofit's board. Districts that seek to appoint a representative are advised to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel regarding any potential conflict of interest that may arise. Additionally, as an alternative to appointing a member to the nonprofit's board, CSBA's Guide suggests that the district designate its charter school contact, appointed pursuant to Education Code 47604.32, to simply attend meetings of the nonprofit's board.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MDQxMQ2" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MDQxMQ2%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22kMQ392%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1718293878%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2047604%2C%20if%20a%20charter%20school%20operates%20as%20or%20is%20operated%20by%20a%20nonprofit%20public%20benefit%20corporation%2C%20the%20Board%20is%20entitled%20to%20appoint%20a%20single%20representative%20to%20the%20board%20of%20directors%20of%20the%20nonprofit%20public%20benefit%20corporation.%20It%20is%20recommended%20that%20the%20Board%20not%20appoint%20a%20district%20employee%20or%20a%20Board%20member%20to%20the%20nonprofit%27s%20board.%20Districts%20that%20seek%20to%20appoint%20a%20representative%20are%20advised%20to%20consult%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel%20regarding%20any%20potential%20conflict%20of%20interest%20that%20may%20arise.%20Additionally%2C%20as%20an%20alternative%20to%20appointing%20a%20member%20to%20the%20nonprofit%27s%20board%2C%20CSBA%27s%20Guide%20suggests%20that%20the%20district%20designate%20its%20charter%20school%20contact%2C%20appointed%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2047604.32%2C%20to%20simply%20attend%20meetings%20of%20the%20nonprofit%27s%20board.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MDQxMQ2" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47604, if a ..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

<strong>Material Revisions to Charter</strong><br>
<br>
Material revisions to a charter may only be made with Board approval. Material revisions shall be governed by the same standards and criteria that apply to petitions for the authorization of charter schools as set forth in Education Code 47605 and shall include, but not be limited to, a reasonably comprehensive description of any new requirement for charter schools enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed. &nbsp;(Education Code 47607)<br>
<br>
The Board shall determine whether a proposed change in charter school operations would constitute a material revision of the approved charter.<br>
<br>
If an approved charter school proposes to expand operations to one or more additional sites or grade levels, whether concurrently with or unrelated to a renewal, the charter school shall request a material revision to its charter and shall notify the Board of those additional locations or grade levels. The Board shall consider approval of the additional locations or grade levels at an open, public meeting. &nbsp;(Education Code 47605, 47607)<br>
<br>
The Board may deny a proposed material revision if it finds that the proposed material revision would render the charter school demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in which the school is located or proposes to locate. In making this finding, the Board shall consider all of the following: &nbsp;(Education Code 47605)
<ol>
	<li>The fiscal impact of the proposed expansion on the district<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The extent to which the expansion would substantially undermine existing services, academic offerings, or programmatic offerings<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Whether the expansion would duplicate a program currently offered within the district that has sufficient capacity for the students proposed to be served within reasonable proximity to where the charter school intends to locate</li>
</ol>
Additionally, the Board may deny a proposed material revision if it finds that the district is not positioned to absorb the fiscal impact of the proposed material revision. The Board shall make this finding if the district has a qualified interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131 and the County Superintendent of Schools, in consultation with the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, certifies that approving the charter school would result in the district having a negative interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131, &nbsp;the district has a negative interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131, or the district is under state receivership. &nbsp;(Education Code 47605)<br>

Whenever a charter school is identified for technical assistance based on the performance of one or more numerically significant student subgroups on SBE-established criteria, the charter school shall receive technical assistance from the County Superintendent. Such technical assistance shall be focused on building the charter school&#39;s capacity to develop and implement actions and services responsive to student and community needs, including, but not limited to, any of the following: &nbsp;(Education Code 47607.3)
<ol>
	<li>Assisting the charter school to identify its strengths and weaknesses in regard to the state priorities applicable to the charter school pursuant to Education Code 47605(c)<br>
	<br>
	This shall include working collaboratively with the charter school to review performance data on the state and local indicators included in the California School Dashboard and other relevant local data and to identify effective, evidence-based programs or practices that address any areas of weakness.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Working collaboratively with the charter school to secure assistance from an academic, programmatic, or fiscal expert or team of experts to identify and implement effective programs and practices that are designed to improve performance in any areas of weakness identified by the charter school<br>
	<br>
	Another service provider, including, but not limited to, a school district, county office of education, or charter school, may be solicited to act as a partner to the charter school in need of technical assistance.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Obtaining from the charter school timely documentation demonstrating that it has completed the activities described in Items #1 and 2 or substantially similar activities, or has selected another service provider to work with the charter school to complete the activities described in Items #1 and 2 or substantially similar activities, and ongoing communication with the Board to assess the charter school&#39;s progress in improving student outcomes</li>
</ol>
In addition, if, in three out of four consecutive school years, a charter school fails to improve outcomes for three or more numerically significant student subgroups, or for all of the student subgroups if the school has fewer than three subgroups, in regard to one or more state or school priorities identified in the charter, the County Superintendent may request that the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI), with SBE approval, assign the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to provide advice and assistance to the charter school pursuant to Education Code 52074. &nbsp;(Education Code 47607.3; 52072)<br>

<strong>School Closure</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='EMQ402' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47605, procedures to be followed in the event a charter school ceases operation for any reason must be specified in the charter; see AR 0420.4 - Charter School Authorization. 5 CCR 11962 lists components that must be included in these procedures, including (1) designation of a responsible entity to conduct closure-related activities, (2) notifications to specified persons and entities, (3) provision of information about students' grade level, course completion, and district of residence, (4) transfer and maintenance of student and personnel records, (5) completion of an independent final audit, (6) disposal of any net assets remaining after all liabilities of the charter school have been paid or otherwise addressed, (7) completion and filing of any annual reports required pursuant to Education Code 47604.33, and (8) identification of funding for the activities identified in 1-7.<br><br>Depending on the terms of the charter, these duties may be performed by the charter school, the district, or another specified entity. However, Education Code 47604.32 specifies that it is the responsibility of the district to notify CDE when a charter school ceases operation for any reason. CSBA's Guide recommends that, in addition to the notifications required by 5 CCR 11962, either the district or the charter school should announce the closure to any school districts that may be responsible for providing education services to the former students of the charter school.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MDQxMQ12" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MDQxMQ12%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22EMQ402%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1718294236%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2047605%2C%20procedures%20to%20be%20followed%20in%20the%20event%20a%20charter%20school%20ceases%20operation%20for%20any%20reason%20must%20be%20specified%20in%20the%20charter%3B%20see%20AR%200420.4%20-%20Charter%20School%20Authorization.%205%20CCR%2011962%20lists%20components%20that%20must%20be%20included%20in%20these%20procedures%2C%20including%20%281%29%20designation%20of%20a%20responsible%20entity%20to%20conduct%20closure-related%20activities%2C%20%282%29%20notifications%20to%20specified%20persons%20and%20entities%2C%20%283%29%20provision%20of%20information%20about%20students%27%20grade%20level%2C%20course%20completion%2C%20and%20district%20of%20residence%2C%20%284%29%20transfer%20and%20maintenance%20of%20student%20and%20personnel%20records%2C%20%285%29%20completion%20of%20an%20independent%20final%20audit%2C%20%286%29%20disposal%20of%20any%20net%20assets%20remaining%20after%20all%20liabilities%20of%20the%20charter%20school%20have%20been%20paid%20or%20otherwise%20addressed%2C%20%287%29%20completion%20and%20filing%20of%20any%20annual%20reports%20required%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2047604.33%2C%20and%20%288%29%20identification%20of%20funding%20for%20the%20activities%20identified%20in%201-7.%5Cn%5CnDepending%20on%20the%20terms%20of%20the%20charter%2C%20these%20duties%20may%20be%20performed%20by%20the%20charter%20school%2C%20the%20district%2C%20or%20another%20specified%20entity.%20However%2C%20Education%20Code%2047604.32%20specifies%20that%20it%20is%20the%20responsibility%20of%20the%20district%20to%20notify%20CDE%20when%20a%20charter%20school%20ceases%20operation%20for%20any%20reason.%20CSBA%27s%20Guide%20recommends%20that%2C%20in%20addition%20to%20the%20notifications%20required%20by%205%20CCR%2011962%2C%20either%20the%20district%20or%20the%20charter%20school%20should%20announce%20the%20closure%20to%20any%20school%20districts%20that%20may%20be%20responsible%20for%20providing%20education%20services%20to%20the%20former%20students%20of%20the%20charter%20school.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MDQxMQ12" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47605, proce..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
