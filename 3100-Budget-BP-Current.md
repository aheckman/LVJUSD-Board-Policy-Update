## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes its critical responsibility for adopting a sound budget each fiscal year which is aligned with and reflects the district's vision, goals, priorities, local control and accountability plan (LCAP), and other comprehensive plans. The district budget shall guide decisions and actions throughout the year and shall serve as a tool for monitoring the fiscal health of the district.

The district budget shall show a complete plan and itemized statement of all proposed expenditures and all estimated revenues for the following fiscal year, together with a comparison of revenues and expenditures for the current fiscal year. The budget shall also include the appropriations limit and the total annual appropriations subject to limitation as determined pursuant to Government Code 7900-7914.  (Education Code 42122)

Budget Development and Adoption Process

In order to provide guidance in the development of the budget, the Board shall annually establish budget priorities based on identified district needs and goals and on realistic projections of available funds.

The Superintendent or designee shall oversee the preparation of a proposed district budget for approval by the Board and shall involve appropriate staff in the development of budget projections.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42103 and 42127 require the district to hold a public hearing prior to adoption of the budget. A public hearing on the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) must occur at the same meeting as the public hearing on the proposed budget. See the accompanying administrative regulation and BP 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan for requirements pertaining to the public hearing.Pursuant to Education Code 52064.1, districts are required to develop a local control funding formula (LCFF) budget overview for parents/guardians with specified information, based on a template created by the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI). The budget overview must be developed in conjunction with, and attached as a cover to, the LCAP and annual update to the LCAP. The adoption, review, approval, and posting of the budget overview are subject to the same requirements as for the LCAP, including the requirement for a public hearing.
The Board shall hold a public hearing on the proposed budget in accordance with Education Code 42103 and 42127. The hearing shall occur at the same meeting as the public hearing on the district's LCAP and the local control funding formula (LCFF) budget overview for parents/guardians.  (Education Code 42103, 42127, 52062, 52064.1)

The Board shall adopt the district budget at a public meeting held after the date of the public hearing, but on or before July 1 of each year. The Board shall adopt the budget following its adoption of the LCAP, or annual update to the LCAP, and the LCFF budget overview for parents/guardians. The budget shall include the expenditures necessary to implement the LCAP or the annual update to the LCAP.  (Education Code 42127, 52062)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 42126, the district budget must be in a format prescribed by the SPI. The SPI has established a requirement that districts use the Standardized Account Code Structure (SACS). SACS ensures that districts meet state and federal reporting guidelines and comply with generally accepted accounting principles prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The California Department of Education's (CDE), "California School Accounting Manual" provides guidance regarding coding of revenues and expenditures.
The budget that is presented at the public hearing as well as the budget formally adopted by the Board shall adhere to the state's Standardized Account Code Structure as prescribed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI).  (Education Code 42126, 42127)

The Superintendent or designee may supplement this format with additional information as necessary to effectively communicate the budget to the Board, staff, and public.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42127 requires the district to file the adopted budget with the County Superintendent of Schools as described below. If the district fails to submit a budget by July 1, the County Superintendent will, at district expense, develop a budget by September 15 and transmit that budget to the Governing Board.
No later than five days after the Board adopts the district budget or by July 1, whichever occurs first, the Board shall file the adopted district budget with the County Superintendent of Schools. The budget and supporting data shall be maintained and made available for public review.  (Education Code 42127)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 42127, on or before September 15, the County Superintendent must approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the district's adopted budget. Education Code 42127 requires that this determination be based on a consideration of whether the district's adopted budget complies with state standards and criteria, will allow the district to meet its current and multiyear financial obligations, includes the expenditures necessary to implement the LCAP or annual update to the LCAP, satisfies all conditions established by the County Superintendent in the case of a conditionally approved budget, and complies with the requirements pertaining to ending fund balances that exceed the state minimum recommended reserve.Education Code 42127 also requires the County Superintendent to consider other studies, reports, evaluations, or audits that may indicate that the district is in fiscal distress; see the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team's, "Fiscal Oversight Guide" and BP 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability.
If the County Superintendent disapproves or conditionally approves the district's budget, the Board shall review and respond to the County Superintendent's recommendations at a regular public meeting on or before October 8. The response shall include any revisions to the adopted budget and any other proposed actions to be taken as a result of those recommendations.  (Education Code 42127)

Budget Advisory Committee

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that choose to establish a budget advisory committee to provide input during the budget development process. The committee may be appointed by the Superintendent or designee (Option 1), by the Board (Option 2), or may be a Board subcommittee composed exclusively of Board members (Option 3). Regardless of whether the district chooses Option 1, 2, or 3, representation of Board members on the committee should be less than a majority of the Board, since having a quorum participate in any committee would in essence create a Board meeting when the committee meets. Committees established by Board action are subject to the Brown Act; see BP/AR 1220 - Citizen Advisory Committees. Districts should delete or modify the following options as appropriate. See the accompanying administrative regulation for optional language regarding the committee's composition and duties.This committee is different from the budget review committee that is required pursuant to Education Code 42127 and 42127.1 if the County Superintendent disapproves the district's budget; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
OPTION 1:  (Budget advisory committee appointed by the Superintendent)

The Superintendent or designee may appoint a budget advisory committee composed of staff, Board representatives, and/or members of the community.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Budget advisory committee appointed by the Board)

The Board may appoint a budget advisory committee composed of staff, Board representatives, and/or members of the community.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

OPTION 3:  (Budget advisory committee is a Board subcommittee)

The Board may establish a budget subcommittee composed exclusively of Board members.

OPTION 3 ENDS HERE

Board representation on any budget advisory committee shall not comprise a majority of the Board.

The committee shall submit recommendations during the budget development process and its duties shall be assigned each year based on district needs. All recommendations of the committee shall be advisory only and shall not be binding on the Board.

Budget Criteria and Standards

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46211, as amended by AB 176 (Ch. 998, Statutes of 2024), attendance generated through an attendance recovery program will be excluded from the average daily attendance (ADA) of the school district.
The district budget shall be developed in accordance with state criteria and standards specified in 5 CCR 15440-15450 as they relate to projections of average daily attendance (ADA), enrollment, ratio of ADA to enrollment, LCFF revenue, salaries and benefits, other revenues and expenditures, facilities maintenance, deficit spending, fund balance, and reserves. In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the supplemental information specified in 5 CCR 15451, which addresses the methodology and budget assumptions used, contingent liabilities, use of one-time revenues for ongoing expenditures, use of ongoing revenues for one-time expenditures, contingent revenues, contributions, long-term commitments, unfunded liabilities, status of collective bargaining agreements, the LCAP, and LCAP expenditures.  (Education Code 33128, 33129, 42127.01; 5 CCR 15440-15451)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that receive supplemental and concentration funding within the LCFF based on the number and concentration of "unduplicated students", students who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals, English learners, and foster youth, pursuant to Education Code 42238.02 and 42238.03. 5. CCR 15496 addresses the method of determining the percentage by which services for unduplicated students must be increased or improved above services provided to all students in the fiscal year. Pursuant to 5 CCR 15496, the district's LCAP must include evidence demonstrating how LCFF funding apportioned on the basis of unduplicated students is used to support such students; see AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.Pursuant to Education Code 42238.01, as amended by AB 176, when a school is between base year eligibility determinations, any current or newly enrolled students who are eligible for free or reduced-priced meals may be included for purposes of the LCFF.
The district budget shall provide for increased or improved services for unduplicated students at least in proportion to the increase in funds apportioned on the basis of the number and concentration of unduplicated students in accordance with 5 CCR 15496. Unduplicated students are students who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals, English learners, and/or foster youth.  (Education Code 42238.07; 5 CCR 15496)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that receive LCFF equity multiplier funding. Pursuant to Education Code 42238.024 and 52064, as added and amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), districts that receive LCFF equity multiplier funding are required to include specific goals in the LCAP for each school generating such funding. Pursuant to Education Code 42238.024, as amended by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), if a school which is otherwise eligible to receive LCFF equity multiplier funds is closed in the year in which the funds are to be allocated, that school is instead deemed to be ineligible, and any unspent funds provided are required to be returned to CDE.
Additionally, the district budget shall provide for increased or improved services for each school which generates LCFF equity multiplier funding.  (Education Code 42238.024, 52064)

The Board may establish other budget assumptions or parameters which may take into consideration the stability of funding sources, legal requirements and constraints on the use of funds, anticipated increases and/or decreases in the cost of services and supplies, program requirements, and any other factors necessary to ensure that the budget is a realistic plan for district revenues and expenditures.

Fund Balance

CSBA NOTE: The following section should be revised to reflect district practice. GASB Statement 54 addresses the way fund balances (i.e., the gross differences between assets and liabilities reflected on the balance sheet) in governmental funds are reported in external financial reports. Fund balances must be classified as nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned in accordance with GASB 54 definitions. For more information regarding reporting and accounting of district funds, see AR 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability. Pursuant to GASB 54, the Board has sole authority to specify purposes of funds classified as "committed" and also must express, or delegate the authority to express, intended purposes of resources that result in the "assigned" fund balance. The Board may modify the following section to reflect its fund balance policy or may adopt a formal resolution containing the required components.
The district shall classify fund balances in compliance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 54, as follows:

	Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that are not expected to be converted to cash, such as resources that are not in a spendable form (e.g., inventories and prepaids) or that are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact
	 
	Restricted fund balance includes amounts constrained to specific purposes by their providers or by law
	
	CSBA NOTE: For purposes of the committed fund balance, GASB 54 requires that the Board commit funds no later than the end of the reporting period. CDE's, "New Requirements for Reporting Fund Balance in Governmental Funds," clarifies that for districts the end of the reporting period is June 30.
	Committed fund balance includes amounts constrained to specific purposes by the Board
	
	For this purpose, all commitments of funds shall be approved by a majority vote of the Board. The constraints shall be imposed no later than the end of the reporting period (June 30), although the actual amounts may be determined subsequent to that date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements.
	 
	Assigned fund balance includes amounts which are intended for a specific purpose but do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or committed
	
	The Board delegates authority to assign funds to the assigned fund balance to the Superintendent and authorizes the assignment of such funds to be made any time prior to the issuance of the financial statements. The Superintendent shall have discretion to further delegate the authority to assign funds.
	 
	Unassigned fund balance includes amounts that are available for any purpose

When multiple types of funds are available for an expenditure, the district shall first utilize funds from the restricted fund balance as appropriate, then from the committed fund balance, then from the assigned fund balance, and lastly from the unassigned fund balance.

CSBA NOTE:  Although not required by GASB 54, the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) recommends that public agencies adopt a minimum fund balance policy that establishes an appropriate level of unrestricted fund balance that will be maintained in the general fund. GFOA's, "Best Practice: Fund Balance Guidelines for the General Fund," describes a variety of factors that should be considered when developing a minimum fund balance policy, such as the predictability of its revenue and volatility of its expenditures, perceived exposure to significant one-time outlays, potential drain upon the general fund from other funds as well as the availability of resources in other funds, potential impact on bond ratings and the corresponding increased cost of borrowed funds, and portion of unrestricted fund balance already committed or assigned for a specific purpose.
The Board intends to maintain a minimum assigned and unassigned fund balance in an amount the Board deems sufficient to maintain fiscal solvency and stability and to protect the district against unforeseen circumstances.

CSBA NOTE: GFOA recommends that the minimum fund policy address both the circumstances under which the unrestricted fund balance can be spent down and the procedure for replenishing deficiencies. The district may revise the following optional paragraph to specify the rate at which the district will attempt to recover the fund balance.
If the assigned and unassigned fund balance falls below the level set by the Board due to an emergency situation, unexpected expenditures, or revenue shortfalls, the Board shall develop a plan to recover the fund balance which may include dedicating new unrestricted revenues, reducing expenditures, and/or increasing revenues or pursuing other funding sources.

Reserve Balance

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 15450 establishes a minimum local reserve balance for economic uncertainties based on the district's ADA. The minimum reserve balance is the greater of five percent or $80,000 for districts with 0-300 ADA; the greater of four percent or $80,000 for districts with 301-1,000 ADA; three percent for districts with 1,001-30,000 ADA; two percent for districts with 30,001-250,000 ADA; and one percent for districts with over 250,000 ADA. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect the minimum reserve applicable to the district's ADA.
The district budget shall include a minimum reserve balance for economic uncertainties that is consistent with the percentage or amount specified in 5 CCR 15450.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42127.01 establishes, under certain conditions, a maximum amount of local reserve balance for economic uncertainties. Pursuant to Education Code 42127.01, if the amount of monies in the state Public School System Stabilization Account is three percent or more of the combined total of general fund revenues appropriated for school districts and allocated local proceeds of taxes, the district's combined assigned or unassigned ending general fund balance must not exceed 10 percent of those funds in the immediately following fiscal year.Basic aid districts, as described in Education Code 42238.02, and districts with 2,500 or less ADA are exempted from this requirement and may delete the following paragraph. Other districts may also be exempted from this requirement by the County Superintendent for up to two consecutive fiscal years within a three-year period upon providing documentation of extraordinary fiscal circumstances, such as multiyear infrastructure or technology projects, that substantiate the need for a reserve in excess of the limit specified in Education Code 42127.01.
In any year following the fiscal year in which the district is notified by the SPI that the amount of monies in the state Public School System Stabilization Account equals or exceeds three percent of the combined total of general fund revenues appropriated for school districts and allocated local proceeds of taxes, the district budget shall not contain a combined assigned or unassigned ending general fund balance that is in excess of 10 percent of these funds, unless the requirement is waived in accordance with Education Code 42127.01.  (Education Code 42127.01)

Long-Term Financial Obligations

The district's current-year budget and multiyear projections shall include adequate provisions for addressing the district's long-term financial obligations, including, but not limited to, long-term obligations resulting from collective bargaining agreements, financing of facilities projects, unfunded or future liability for retiree benefits, and accrued workers' compensation claims.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Government Code 21710-21716 establish the California Employers' Pension Prefunding Trust Program and related Trust Fund, allowing districts that provide a defined benefit pension plan to their employees to prefund required pension contributions to the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS). Districts may elect to participate in the Prefunding Trust Program for the purpose of investing payments toward their required CalPERS pension contributions.
The Board may approve a plan for meeting the district's long-term obligations to fund contributions to the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) or other defined pension plans such as the California State Teachers Retirement System which, to the extent possible, minimizes significant increases in annual general fund expenditures towards pension obligations. The plan may include prefunding required pension contributions through the California Employers' Pension Prefunding Trust Program pursuant to Government Code 21710-21716.

CSBA NOTE: The following two optional paragraphs are for use by districts that provide "other postemployment benefits" (OPEBs), such as medical, dental, vision, hearing, life insurance, long-term care, long-term disability, and other nonpension benefits to retired employees or Board members, and should be revised to reflect district practice; see BP/AR 4154/4254/4354 - Health and Welfare Benefits and BB 9250 - Remuneration, Reimbursement and Other Benefits. CSBA recommends that districts adopt a specific funding strategy for addressing their OPEB obligations. The district may pay the premiums as they fall due ("pay-as-you-go"), but in such a case the district would then accrue a deficit with respect to future retirees which can be expected to grow as a result of an increasing retiree population and increases in benefit costs. Therefore, it is recommended that the district prefund the debt, to the extent possible, using a method and level to be determined by the Board. For example, the district may contribute a set amount or percentage of the actuarially determined "annual required contributions" to an irrevocable trust or designated fund each year.GASB Statement 75 requires districts that do not provide OPEB through a trust to report the total unfunded liability (i.e., OPEBs that are not prefunded) in the district's financial statements; see AR 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability.CSBA's OPEB Solutions Program provides access to a trusted source of analysis and a GASB 75-compliant trust to prefund future obligations. See CSBA's website for further information.
The Board shall approve a plan for meeting the district's long-term obligations to fund nonpension, other postemployment benefits (OPEBs). This plan shall include a specific funding strategy and the method that will be used to finance the district's annual fiscal obligations for such benefits in a manner that continually reduces the deficit to the district to the extent possible. The Board reserves the authority to review and amend the funding strategy as necessary to ensure that it continues to serve the best interests of the district and maintains flexibility to adjust for changing budgetary considerations.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually present a report to the Board on the estimated accrued but unfunded cost of OPEBs. As a separate agenda item at the same meeting, the Board shall disclose whether it will reserve a sufficient amount of money in its budget to fund the present value of the benefits of existing retirees and/or the future cost of employees who are eligible for benefits in the current fiscal year.  (Education Code 42140)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that are self-insured for workers' compensation claims, either individually or as part of a joint powers agency. See AR 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability for provisions related to reporting the estimated accrued but unfunded cost of workers' compensation claims based on an actuarial report.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually present a report to the Board on the estimated accrued but unfunded cost of workers' compensation claims and the actuarial reports upon which the estimated costs are based. As a separate agenda item at the same meeting, the Board shall disclose whether it will reserve in the budget sufficient amounts to fund the present value of accrued but unfunded workers' compensation claims or if it is otherwise decreasing the amount in its workers' compensation reserve fund. The Board shall annually certify to the County Superintendent the amount, if any, that it has decided to reserve in the budget for these costs. The Board shall submit to the County Superintendent any budget revisions that may be necessary to account for this budget reserve.  (Education Code 42141)

Budget Amendments

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional and should be revised to reflect district practice.
No later than 45 days after the Governor signs the annual Budget Act, the Superintendent or designee shall make available for public review any revisions in budgeted revenues and expenditures which occur as a result of the funding made available by that Budget Act.  (Education Code 42127)

Whenever revenues and expenditures change significantly throughout the year, the Superintendent or designee shall recommend budget amendments to ensure accurate projections of the district's net ending balance. When final figures for the prior-year budget are available, this information shall be used as soon as possible to update the current-year budget's beginning balance and projected revenues and expenditures.

In addition, budget amendments shall be submitted for Board approval as necessary when collective bargaining agreements are accepted, district income declines, increased revenues or unanticipated savings are made available to the district, program proposals are significantly different from those approved during budget adoption, interfund transfers are needed to meet actual program expenditures, and/or other significant changes occur that impact budget projections.

<strong>Fund Balance</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='UMw694' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The following section should be revised to reflect district practice. GASB Statement 54 addresses the way fund balances (i.e., the gross differences between assets and liabilities reflected on the balance sheet) in governmental funds are reported in external financial reports. Fund balances must be classified as nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned in accordance with GASB 54 definitions.

<div id='QNw701' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The following two optional paragraphs are for use by districts that provide "other postemployment benefits" (OPEBs), such as medical, dental, vision, hearing, life insurance, long-term care, long-term disability, and other nonpension benefits to retired employees or Board members, and should be revised to reflect district practice; see BP/AR 4154/4254/4354 - Health and Welfare Benefits and BB 9250 - Remuneration, Reimbursement and Other Benefits. CSBA recommends that districts adopt a specific funding strategy for addressing their OPEB obligations. The district may pay the premiums as they fall due ("pay-as-you-go"), but in such a case the district would then accrue a deficit with respect to future retirees which can be expected to grow as a result of an increasing retiree population and increases in benefit costs. Therefore, it is recommended that the district prefund the debt, to the extent possible, using a method and level to be determined by the Board. For example, the district may contribute a set amount or percentage of the actuarially determined "annual required contributions" to an irrevocable trust or designated fund each year.<br><br>GASB Statement 75 requires districts that do not provide OPEB through a trust to report the total unfunded liability (i.e., OPEBs that are not prefunded) in the district's financial statements; see AR 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability.<br><br>CSBA's OPEB Solutions Program provides access to a trusted source of analysis and a GASB 75-compliant trust to prefund future obligations.

The Board shall approve a plan for meeting the district&#39;s long-term obligations to fund nonpension, other postemployment benefits (OPEBs). This plan shall include a specific funding strategy and the method that will be used to finance the district&#39;s annual fiscal obligations for such benefits in a manner that continually reduces the deficit to the district to the extent possible. The Board reserves the authority to review and amend the funding strategy as necessary to ensure that it continues to serve the best interests of the district and maintains flexibility to adjust for changing budgetary considerations.<br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall annually present a report to the Board on the estimated accrued but unfunded cost of OPEBs. As a separate agenda item at the same meeting, the Board shall disclose whether it will reserve a sufficient amount of money in its budget to fund the present value of the benefits of existing retirees and/or the future cost of employees who are eligible for benefits in the current fiscal year.&nbsp; (Education Code 42140)<br>

Whenever revenues and expenditures change significantly throughout the year, the Superintendent or designee shall recommend budget amendments to ensure accurate projections of the district&#39;s net ending balance. When final figures for the prior-year budget are available, this information shall be used as soon as possible to update the current-year budget&#39;s beginning balance and projected revenues and expenditures.<br>
<br>
In addition, budget amendments shall be submitted for Board approval as necessary when collective bargaining agreements are accepted, district income declines, increased revenues or unanticipated savings are made available to the district, program proposals are significantly different from those approved during budget adoption, interfund transfers are needed to meet actual program expenditures, and/or other significant changes occur that impact budget projections.</body>
