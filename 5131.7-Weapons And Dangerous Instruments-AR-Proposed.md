The principal shall report any possession of a weapon or dangerous instrument to the student's parents/guardians by telephone or in person, and shall follow this notification with a letter.

The employee shall retain possession of the instrument until the risk of its use as a weapon has dissipated or, upon the request of the student's parent/guardian, until the parent/guardian appears and personally takes possession.  (Education Code 49331, 49332)
