## Policy Content

District strategies to improve student safety along routes to school and to promote walking, bicycling, and other forms of active transport to school by students may include:

	Education activities that promote safety and awareness, such as:
	 
	
		Instructing students about pedestrian and personal safety related to the use of electric or motorized and nonmotorized bicycles or scooters, including by local law enforcement, organizations specified in Education Code 38134, and public agencies that provide safety instructions on such bicycles and scooters.
		 
		Instructing students about the health, academic, and environmental benefits of walking, bicycling, and other forms of active transport to school
		 
		Offering driver safety information to high school students, parents/guardians, and the community to promote safety around school campuses and routes
		 
	
	
	Encouragement strategies designed to generate interest in active transport to school, such as:
	 
	
		Organizing or facilitating "walking school buses" and/or "bicycle trains" whereby students walk or bike to school in groups escorted by parents/guardians or other volunteers as needed
		 
		Organizing special events and activities, such as Walk or Bike to School Day, International Walk to School Month, or year-round competitions
		 
		Publicizing the Sistrict's efforts in order to build support of parents/guardians and the community, including providing information about the Sistrict's safe routes to school program in parent/guardian communications and in any notifications about transportation options
		 
	
	
	Enforcement strategies to deter unsafe behaviors of drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists, such as:
	 
	
		Initiating or expanding crossing guard, student safety patrol, and/or parent/guardian safety patrol programs
		 
		Partnering with local law enforcement to help ensure that traffic laws are obeyed in the vicinity of schools and to implement appropriate measures such as placement of speed feedback monitors, ticketing, and/or driver safety campaigns
		 
		Monitoring to ensure that students who bicycle to school or who use skateboards, skates, or nonmotorized scooters wear helmets in accordance with Vehicle Code 21212
		 
	
	
	Engineering strategies that address the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of traffic control devices or physical measures, such as:
	 
	
		Working with local government agencies, parents/guardians, school staff, and others as appropriate to gather data about environmental conditions and hazards along routes to school
		 
		Working with local government agencies to make operational and physical improvements that reduce or eliminate hazards, such as reducing motor vehicle traffic speeds in the area and establishing safer and fully accessible crosswalks, walkways, trails, and bikeways
		 
		Assessing the adequacy, accessibility, and safety of bicycle parking at schools and making modifications as needed, such as increasing the number of or relocating bicycle racks and/or equipment storage areas
		 
		Considering safe routes to school when making decisions about siting and designing of new schools
		 
	
	
	Evaluation to assess progress toward program goals, including:
	 
	
		Gathering and interpreting data based on indicators established by the Superintendent and the Board of Education
		 
		Presenting data to the Board, program partners, and the public
		 
		Recommending program modifications as needed
		 
	
	
	Emerging technologies that aid in the prevention and mitigation of accidents
	 
	Emergency response in managing injuries after an accident occurs, including, but not limited to, training staff, crossing guards, student and/or parent/guardian safety patrols, and other volunteers who assist with drop-off and pick-up in emergency procedures
	 
	Equity, such that resources are distributed in a manner that provides safe access and participation in an equitable manner across the community
