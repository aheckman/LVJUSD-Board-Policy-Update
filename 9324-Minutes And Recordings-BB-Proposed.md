## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that maintaining accurate minutes of Board meetings helps foster public trust in Board governance and provides a record of Board actions for use by District staff and the public.

The secretary of the Board shall keep minutes and record all official Board actions. The Board's minutes shall be public records and shall be made available to the public upon request.  (Education Code 35145, 35163)

The minutes of Board meetings shall include, but not be limited to:


	A notation of which Board members are present, in person or by teleconference, and whether a member is not present for part of the meeting due to late arrival and/or early departure
	 
	A brief summary of the Board's discussion on each agenda topic, rather than a verbatim record of each Board member's specific points of view during the discussion
	 
	 A summary of the public comments made on agendized items and unagendized topics
	 
	The specific language of each motion and the names of the Board members who made and seconded the motion
	 
	Preferential votes cast by student Board member(s)  (Education Code 35012)
	 
	Any action taken by the Board, and the vote or abstention on that action of each Board member present  (Education Code 35145; Government Code 54953)

Upon request by a student's parent/guardian, or by the student if age 18 or older, the minutes shall not include the student's or parent/guardian's address, telephone number, date of birth, or email address, or the student's name or other directory information as defined in Education Code 49061. The request to exclude such information shall be made in writing to the secretary or clerk of the Board.  (Education Code 49073.2)

The Board agenda shall include a statement of the option and process for students and parents/guardians to request that such information be excluded from the minutes.

The Superintendent or designee shall distribute a copy of the "unapproved" minutes of the previous meeting(s) with the agenda for the next regular meeting. The Board shall approve the minutes as circulated or with necessary amendments.

Upon approval by the Board, the minutes shall be signed by the board clerk.

Official Board minutes and recordings shall be stored in a secure location and shall be retained in accordance with law.

Any minutes or recordings kept for Board meetings held in closed session shall be kept separately from the minutes or recordings of regular and special meetings. Minutes or recordings of closed sessions are not public records.  (Government Code 54957.2)

Recording or Broadcasting of Meetings

The District may tape, film, stream, or broadcast any open Board meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, the Board president shall announce that a recording or broadcasting is being made at the direction of the Board and that the recording or broadcast may capture images and sounds of those attending the meeting. As practicable, the recorder or camera shall be placed in plain view of meeting participants.

Any District recording may be erased or destroyed 30 days after the meeting. Recordings made at the direction of the Board during a meeting are public records and, upon request, shall be made available for inspection by members of the public on District equipment without charge.  (Government Code 54953.5)
