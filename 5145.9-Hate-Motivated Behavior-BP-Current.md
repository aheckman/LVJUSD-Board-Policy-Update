## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy addresses prevention strategies for hate-motivated incidents and should be modified to reflect district practice.  Elements of this policy may be integrated into existing district and school site plans, such as the local control and accountability plan, comprehensive school safety plan, and staff development plans.
The Governing Board is committed to providing a respectful, inclusive, and safe learning environment that protects students from discrimination, harassment, intimidation, bullying, or any other type of behavior that is motivated by hate.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph reflects the definition of "hate-motivated behavior" specified in the California Department of Education's (CDE) publication Bullying at School, expanded to include the categories of protected characteristics identified in state and federal law. Also see BP 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities and AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.
Hate-motivated behavior is any behavior intended to cause emotional suffering, physical injury, or property damage through intimidation, harassment, bigoted slurs or epithets, force or threat of force, or vandalism motivated in part or in whole by bias or hostility toward the victim's real or perceived race, color, ancestry, nationality, national origin, immigration status, ethnic group identification, ethnicity, age, religion, marital status, pregnancy, parental status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or genetic information, or any other characteristic identified in Education Code 200 or 220, Government Code 11135, or Penal Code 422.55.

The Superintendent or designee shall design strategies to promote harmonious relationships among students, prevent incidents of hate-motivated behavior to the extent possible, and address such incidents in a timely manner when they occur.

CSBA NOTE: Hate-motivated behavior, such as an assault, physical threat, bomb threat, destruction of property, graffiti, and vandalism, may constitute a crime under state or federal law. Local law enforcement agencies, human rights commissions, and community organizations throughout the state have established countywide hate crimes networks aimed at responding to and preventing hate crimes.Districts can identify local hate crime resources through the California Association of Human Relations Organizations, which conducts activities designed to protect human and civil rights by creating a climate of respect and inclusion through networks of collaborations that reduce community tension and build intergroup relationships.
The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with regional programs and community organizations to promote an environment where diversity is celebrated and hate-motivated behavior is not tolerated. Such collaborative efforts shall focus on the development of effective prevention strategies and response plans, provision of assistance to students affected by hate-motivated behavior, and/or education of students who have perpetrated hate-motivated acts.

The district shall provide students with age-appropriate instruction that:

	Includes the development of social-emotional learning
	 
	Promotes an understanding, awareness, appreciation, and respect for human rights, human relations, diversity, and acceptance in a multicultural society
	 
	Explains the harm and dangers of explicit and implicit biases
	 
	Discourages discriminatory attitudes and practices
	 
	Provides strategies to manage conflicts constructively

As necessary, the district shall provide counseling, guidance, and support to students who are victims of hate-motivated behavior and to students who exhibit such behavior.

When appropriate, students who engage in hate-motivated behavior shall be disciplined.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 218 requires CDE, by July 1, 2021, to develop and/or update resources for use in schools serving students in grades 7-12 for in-service training for the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) students, and strategies to increase support for LGBTQ students which improve overall school climate. Pursuant to Education Code 218, districts that serve students in grades 7-12 are encouraged to use such resources to provide training at least once every two years to teachers and other certificated staff.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide staff with training that:

	Promotes an understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion
	 
	Discourages the development of discriminatory attitudes and practices
	 
	Includes social-emotional learning and nondiscriminatory instructional and counseling methods
	 
	Supports the prevention, recognition, and response to hate-motivated behavior
	 
	Raises the awareness and sensitivity of staff to potentially prejudicial and discriminatory behavior
	 
	Includes effective enforcement of rules for appropriate student conduct

Employees who engage in hate-motivated behavior shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.
Rules prohibiting hate-motivated behavior and procedures for reporting a hate-motivated incident shall be provided to students, staff, and parents/guardians.

This policy shall be posted in a prominent location on the district's web site in a manner that is readily and easily accessible to parents/guardians and students.  (Education Code 234.6)

Complaints

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 234.1, districts are required to adopt a process for receiving and investigating complaints involving unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, and bullying) based on race or ethnicity, nationality, disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sex, sexual orientation, religion, immigration status, or any characteristic contained in the definition of hate crimes in Penal Code 422.55, or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. In addition, federal regulations require districts to adopt procedures providing for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex (34 CFR 106.8), disability (34 CFR 104.7 and 28 CFR 35.107), and age (34 CFR 110.25). Pursuant to 5 CCR 4600-4670, uniform complaint procedures (UCP) must be used for this purpose. See BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures. Complaints of sexual harassment that meet the federal definition of sexual harassment in 34 CFR 106.30 must be addressed through the procedures specified in 34 CFR 106.44-106.45; see AR 5145.71 - Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures.Although some incidents of harassment, intimidation, or bullying may not fall within the provisions of Education Code 234.1 or federal civil rights regulations, CSBA recommends that districts use the UCP to investigate all incidents (whether discriminatory or nondiscriminatory) to ensure consistent implementation by district staff. It is not always easy or possible for staff to know prior to an investigationwhether a student was victimized because of an actual or perceived membership in a legally protected class. Those incidents found to involve discrimination based on the results of the investigation would then be resolved using the UCP. When an incident is determined to be nondiscriminatory, it should be resolved through the appropriate disciplinary process.
Any staff member who is notified that hate-motivated behavior has occurred, observes such behavior, or otherwise becomes aware of an incident shall immediately contact the compliance officer responsible for coordinating the district's response to complaints and complying with state and federal civil rights laws. As appropriate, the staff member shall also contact law enforcement.

A student or parent/guardian who believes the student is a victim of hate-motivated behavior is encouraged to report the incident to a teacher, the principal, the district's compliance officer, or other staff member.

Any complaint of hate-motivated behavior shall be investigated and, if determined to be discriminatory, shall be resolved in accordance with law and the district's uniform complaint procedures specified in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures or other applicable procedure. If, during the investigation, it is determined that a complaint is about nondiscriminatory behavior, the principal or designee shall inform the complainant and shall take all necessary actions to resolve the complaint.

When an incident is determined to be nondiscriminatory, it should be resolved through the appropriate disciplinary process.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="kNDEOA4" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22kNDEOA4%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22kMg982%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1623704485%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%20234.1%2C%20districts%20are%20required%20to%20adopt%20a%20process%20for%20receiving%20and%20investigating%20complaints%20involving%20unlawful%20discrimination%20%28such%20as%20discriminatory%20harassment%2C%20intimidation%2C%20and%20bullying%29%20based%20on%20race%20or%20ethnicity%2C%20nationality%2C%20disability%2C%20gender%2C%20gender%20identity%2C%20gender%20expression%2C%20sex%2C%20sexual%20orientation%2C%20religion%2C%20immigration%20status%2C%20or%20any%20characteristic%20contained%20in%20the%20definition%20of%20hate%20crimes%20in%20Penal%20Code%20422.55%2C%20or%20association%20with%20a%20person%20or%20group%20with%20one%20or%20more%20of%20these%20actual%20or%20perceived%20characteristics.%20In%20addition%2C%20federal%20regulations%20require%20districts%20to%20adopt%20procedures%20providing%20for%20the%20prompt%20and%20equitable%20resolution%20of%20complaints%20of%20discrimination%20on%20the%20basis%20of%20sex%20%2834%20CFR%20106.8%29%2C%20disability%20%2834%20CFR%20104.7%20and%2028%20CFR%2035.107%29%2C%20and%20age%20%2834%20CFR%20110.25%29.%20Pursuant%20to%205%20CCR%204600-4670%2C%20uniform%20complaint%20procedures%20%28UCP%29%20must%20be%20used%20for%20this%20purpose.%20See%20BP/AR%201312.3%20-%20Uniform%20Complaint%20Procedures.%20Complaints%20of%20sexual%20harassment%20that%20meet%20the%20federal%20definition%20of%20sexual%20harassment%20in%2034%20CFR%20106.30%20must%20be%20addressed%20through%20the%20procedures%20specified%20in%2034%20CFR%20106.44-106.45%3B%20see%20AR%205145.71%20-%20Title%20IX%20Sexual%20Harassment%20Complaint%20Procedures.%5Cn%5CnAlthough%20some%20incidents%20of%20harassment%2C%20intimidation%2C%20or%20bullying%20may%20not%20fall%20within%20the%20provisions%20of%20Education%20Code%20234.1%20or%20federal%20civil%20rights%20regulations%2C%20CSBA%20recommends%20that%20districts%20use%20the%20UCP%20to%20investigate%20all%20incidents%20%28whether%20discriminatory%20or%20nondiscriminatory%29%20to%20ensure%20consistent%20implementation%20by%20district%20staff.%20It%20is%20not%20always%20easy%20or%20possible%20for%20staff%20to%20know%20prior%20to%20an%20investigation%5Cnwhether%20a%20student%20was%20victimized%20because%20of%20an%20actual%20or%20perceived%20membership%20in%20a%20legally%20protected%20class.%20Those%20incidents%20found%20to%20involve%20discrimination%20based%20on%20the%20results%20of%20the%20investigation%20would%20then%20be%20resolved%20using%20the%20UCP.%20When%20an%20incident%20is%20determined%20to%20be%20nondiscriminatory%2C%20it%20should%20be%20resolved%20through%20the%20appropriate%20disciplinary%20process.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-kNDEOA4" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 234.1, distr..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
Any staff member who is notified that hate-motivated behavior has occurred, observes such behavior, or otherwise becomes aware of an incident shall immediately contact the compliance officer responsible for coordinating the district&#39;s response to complaints and complying with state and federal civil rights laws. As appropriate, the staff member shall also contact law enforcement.<br>
<br>
A student or parent/guardian who believes the student is a victim of hate-motivated behavior is encouraged to report the incident to a teacher, the principal, the district&#39;s compliance officer, or other staff member.<br>
<br>
Any complaint of hate-motivated behavior shall be investigated and, if determined to be discriminatory, shall be resolved in accordance with law and the district&#39;s uniform complaint procedures specified in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures or other applicable procedure. If, during the investigation, it is determined that a complaint is about nondiscriminatory behavior, the principal or designee shall inform the complainant and shall take all necessary actions to resolve the complaint.</body>
