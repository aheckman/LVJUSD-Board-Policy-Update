REQUIREMENTS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47610, charter schools are exempt from Education Code provisions governing school districts unless otherwise specified in law. However, charter schools, like other public schools, are subject to the state and federal constitutions, applicable federal laws, state laws that apply to governmental agencies in general, and state laws that are expressly applicable to charter schools. Violation of any law may subject the charter school to revocation pursuant to Education Code 47607; see BP 0420.43 - Charter School Revocation.
This exhibit is a non-exhaustive list of legal requirements that apply to charter schools and may be used by districts to monitor a charter school's compliance with law. Other legal requirements may exist and may be identified in the future.

A charter school shall be subject to the terms of its charter; any memorandum of understanding between the school and the district Governing Board; the state and federal constitutions; applicable federal laws; state laws that apply to governmental agencies in general; and other legal requirements that are expressly applicable to charter schools, including, but not limited to, the following requirements.

Governance


	Comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act (Government Code 54950-54963), California Public Records Act (Government Code 7920.000-7930.215), conflict of interest laws (Government Code 1090-1099), and Political Reform Act (Government Code 81000-91014), including the adoption of a conflict of interest code pursuant to Government Code 87300  (Education Code 47604.1)
	 
	Except as otherwise authorized by Government Code 54954, hold the meetings of its governing body within the physical boundaries of the county in which the charter school is located or, if a nonclassroom-based charter school that does not have a facility or operates one or more resource centers, hold governing body meetings within the physical boundaries of the county in which the greatest number of students enrolled in the charter school reside
	
	In addition, a two-way teleconference location shall be established at the school site and/or resource center, as applicable.  (Education Code 47604.1)
	 
	The charter school's executive director or any of the charter school's employees shall not serve as a member of the county board of education in the county where the charter school is located  (Education Code 1006; Government Code 1099)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47604.2, the governing body of a charter school attended by high school students is required to appoint a student member to the governing body if it receives a petition for such appointment, and, as amended by AB 275 (Ch. 321, Statutes of 2023), may award the student member of the governing body elective course credit based on the number of equivalent daily instructional minutes for the student member's services provided or monthly financial compensation for such service.
	If the charter school is attended by high school students and the governing body receives student petition to appoint a student member to the governing body, appoint one or more student members in accordance with Education Code 47604.2
	
	Operations
	 
	Not be operated as, or be operated by, a for-profit corporation, a for-profit educational management organization, or a for-profit charter management organization  (Education Code 47604)
	 
	Be nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations  (Education Code 47605)
	
	Admission/Enrollment
	 
	Adhere to all laws establishing the minimum age for public school attendance  (Education Code 47610)
	 
	Serve students who are California residents and who, if over 19 years of age, are continuously enrolled in a public school and making "satisfactory progress" toward a high school diploma as defined in 5 CCR 11965  (Education Code 47612)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 56145 requires charter schools to serve students with disabilities in the same manner as other public schools. Pursuant to Education Code 47646, districts must ensure that each charter school that is deemed to be a public school of the district, and is not its own local educational agency (LEA) for special education purposes, receives an equitable share of special education funding and services for students with disabilities who are enrolled in the charter school.If a charter school is operating as a public school of the district for purposes of special education, the district retains responsibility and must determine how to ensure that students with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE). However, as indicated in the California Office of Administrative Hearings ruling in Student v. Horizon Instructional Systems Charter School, a charter school operating as its own LEA for purposes of special education, including a charter school offering an independent study program, is the entity responsible for providing FAPE.
	Serve students with disabilities in the same manner as such students are served in other district schools  (Education Code 47646, 56145)
	 
	Admit all students who wish to attend the charter school, according to the following criteria and procedures:
	 
	
		Admission to the charter school shall not be determined according to the student's or parent/guardian's place of residence within the state, except that any existing public school converting partially or entirely to a charter school shall adopt and maintain a policy giving admission preference to students who reside within that school's former attendance area  (Education Code 47605)
		
		If a charter school will be physically located in a public elementary school attendance area in which 50 percent or more of the student enrollment is eligible for free or reduced-price meals, it may also establish an admission preference for students who are currently enrolled in that public elementary school and for students who reside in the public school attendance area.  (Education Code 47605.3)
		 
		If the number of students who wish to attend the charter school exceeds the school's capacity, attendance shall be determined by a public random drawing, with preference extended to students currently attending the charter school and students who reside in the district, except as provided for in Education Code 47614.5  (Education Code 47605)
		 
		Other admission preferences may be permitted by the Board of the district on an individual school basis consistent with law
		
		Preferences shall not result in limited enrollment access for students with disabilities, academically low-achieving students, English learners, neglected or delinquent students, students experiencing homelessness, foster youth, students who are economically disadvantaged, or on the basis of nationality, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Mandatory parental volunteer hours shall not be the basis of a preference or a criterion for admission or continued enrollment.  (Education Code 47605)
		 
	
	
	Not discourage a student from enrolling or seeking to enroll in the charter school, nor encourage a current student from disenrolling, for any reason, including, but not limited to, the student's academic performance, nationality, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation or because the student is a student with disabilities, academically low achieving, an English learner, neglected or delinquent, experiencing homelessness, economically disadvantaged, or a foster youth
	
	The charter school shall not request or require a student's records to be submitted before enrollment. The charter school shall post on its website the California Department of Education's (CDE) notice of these requirements and shall provide the notice to parents/guardians or students age 18 and older when the parent/guardian or student inquires about enrollment, before conducting an enrollment lottery, and before disenrollment of a student.  (Education Code 47605)
	 
	Comply with the requirements of Education Code 48850-48859 regarding enrollment, identification, and placement of students experiencing homelessness and unaccompanied youth  (Education Code 48850, 48851, 48852.5, 48852.6; 42 USC 11431-11435)
	 
	Comply with the requirements of Education Code 48850-48859 regarding the enrollment and placement of foster youth  (Education Code 48853.5, 48859)
	 
	Allow a student who is enrolled in the charter school but receiving individual instruction at home or a hospital due to a temporary disability to return to the charter school when well enough to do so, provided the student returns during the school year in which the individual instruction was initiated  (Education Code 48207.3)
	
	Nondiscrimination
	 
	Not discriminate against any student on the basis of the characteristics listed in Education Code 220  (Education Code 47605)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 243, as added by AB 1078 (Ch. 229, Statutes of 2023), clarifies when it is unlawful discrimination for the Board to (1) refuse to approve the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or resource in a school library or (2) prohibit the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or resource in a school library. The Board may not refuse to approve such use on the basis that the material includes a study of the role and contributions of specified individuals or groups, unless the study of the role and contributions reflects adversely upon legally protected groups. Additionally, the Board may not prohibit such use on the basis that the study of the role and contributions contain inclusive or diverse perspectives.
	Not discriminate in the use, selection, or rejection of textbooks, instructional materials, library books, or similar educational resources  (Education Code 243)
	 
	Adopt policy that is consistent with the model policy developed by the California Attorney General addressing the charter school's response to immigration enforcement, notify parents/guardians of their children's right to a free public education regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs, prohibit the collection of information or documents regarding the immigration status of students or their family members, and fulfill other requirements of Education Code 234.7
	 
	Post specified information related to the prohibition against discrimination under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 in a prominent and conspicuous location on the school website or on the website of the charter operator  (Education Code 221.61)
	 
	If the charter school offers competitive athletics, annually post on the school's website or on the website of the charter operator the total enrollment of the school classified by gender, the number of students who participate in competitive athletics classified by gender, and the number of boys' and girls' teams classified by sport and by competition level  (Education Code 221.9)
	 
	Provide specified accommodations to pregnant and parenting students, including, but not limited to, the provision of parental leave and reasonable accommodations on campus to a lactating student to express breast milk, breastfeed an infant child, or address other needs related to breastfeeding
	
	The charter school shall notify pregnant and parenting students and parents/guardians of the rights and options available to pregnant and parenting students.  (Education Code 222, 222.5, 46015)
	 
	If a direct-funded charter school, adopt and implement uniform complaint procedures to resolve complaints of unlawful discrimination or alleged violation of a state or federal law or regulation governing educational programs, in accordance with 5 CCR 4600-4670  (5 CCR 4600)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #22 applies to charter schools that serve high school students and participate in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF). Pursuant to Education Code 33353, as amended by AB 1327 (Ch. 366, Statutes of 2023), a charter school is required to post on its website, on or before April 1, 2025, the standardized incident form developed by the California Department of Education (CDE) to track racial discrimination, harassment, or hazing, that occurs at high school sporting games or events.
	If the charter school serves high school students and participates in the California Interscholastic Federation, post the standardized incident form developed by CDE to track racial discrimination, harassment, or hazing that occurs at high school sporting games or events on the charter school's website on or before April 1, 2025, and, upon CDE's request, submit information related to any completed standardized incident forms received by the charter school  (Ed. Code 33353)
	
	Tuition and Fees
	 
	Not charge tuition  (Education Code 47605)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47605 specifically prohibits a charter school from charging tuition, but does not mention fees or other charges. As clarified in CDE advisory, "Pupil Fees, Deposits, and Other Charges," because charter schools are subject to the California Constitution, the free school guarantee of the California Constitution, Article 9, Section 5, applies to charter schools. Charter schools may only charge fees which are explicitly authorized by law for charter schools.
	Not charge student fees for any activity that is an integral component of the educational program, except as authorized by those Education Code provisions that explicitly apply to charter schools  (Education Code 49010, 49011)
	 
	Not bill, nor take any negative action against, a student or former student for a debt owed to the charter school
	
	The school shall provide an itemized invoice for any amount owed by the parent/guardian on behalf of a student or former student before pursuing payment of the debt and shall provide a receipt to the parent/guardian for each payment made to the school.  (Education Code 49014)
	
	School Plans
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52064.3, by January 31, 2025, charter schools that are identified by CDE as needing an improvement plan pursuant to 34 CFR 300.600-300.647 are required to complete an Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Addendum adopted by SBE relating to improvements in services for students with disabilities. See BP 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan for more information.
	Adopt a local control and accountability plan (LCAP) and update the plan by July 1 each year, after holding a public hearing, consulting with specified stakeholders, and using the template adopted by the State Board of Education (SBE)
	 
	As part of the LCAP adoption and annual update to the LCAP, the governing body of the charter school shall separately adopt a local control funding formula budget overview for parents/guardians and as appropriate, an Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Addendum, based on the templates developed by SBE  (Education Code 47604.33, 47606.5, 52064, 52064.1, 52064.3)

	Curriculum and Instruction
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47612.5 specifies, by grade level, the minimum number of instructional minutes that must be offered each fiscal year. Any charter school that fails to meet this requirement will have its state apportionment reduced in proportion to the percentage of instructional minutes that the school fails to offer. Education Code 47612.5 and 47612.6 provide that neither the State Board of Education nor the Superintendent of Public Instruction may waive the required number of instructional minutes but may waive the fiscal penalties under specified conditions.
	Offer at least the number of instructional minutes required by law for the grade levels provided by the charter school  (Education Code 47612.5)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49056, as added by SB 291 (Ch. 863, Statutes of 2023), charter schools that maintain any of grades K-8 are required to provide at least one or more periods of recess that total 30 minutes on regular instructional days and at least 15 minutes on early release days, except that for any student with a disability, recess is required to be in accordance with the student's individualized education program or Section 504 plan.

	Require students to meet the state minimum course requirements for graduation as specified in Education Code 51225.3, as well as any additional graduation requirements required by the governing body   (Education Code 51225.3)
	
	Student Expression
	 
	Allow a student to wear traditional tribal regalia or recognized objects of religious or cultural significance as an adornment at school graduation ceremonies, unless the charter school determines that an item is likely to cause a substantial disruption of, or material interference with, the ceremony  (Education Code 35183.1)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48907 requires charter schools to establish a written "publications code" related to students' rights to freedom of speech and of the press. These written rules and regulations must include reasonable provisions for the time, place, and manner in which free expression may take place within the charter school's jurisdiction.
	Provide students the right to exercise freedom of speech and of the press including, but not limited to, the use of bulletin boards; the distribution of printed materials or petitions; the wearing of buttons, badges, and other insignia; and the right of expression in official publications  (Education Code 48907, 48950)
