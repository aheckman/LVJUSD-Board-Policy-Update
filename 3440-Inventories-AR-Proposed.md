	Original cost of the item of equipment or a reasonable estimate if the original cost is unknown

	The date and method of disposal

In addition to the information specified in items #1-6 above, the following information shall be recorded for equipment acquired with state and/or federal categorical funds unless otherwise specified in law:  (5 CCR 3946; 2 CFR 200.313)

Whenever an equipment item is moved to a new location or the equipment is used for a new purpose, the new location or purpose shall be recorded in the inventory.

A copy of the inventory shall be kept at the District office and at the appropriate school site.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually submit an inventory listing of federally owned property in its custody to the federal agency that granted the award.  (2 CFR 200.312)
