## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be modified to reflect district practice.Pursuant to Education Code 48904, parents/guardians are liable to the district for the costs of damages caused by the willful misconduct of their minor children (1) that results in damage to school property, an employee's personal property, or injury or death of a district student, employee, or volunteer, and (2) for any reward paid by the district for information leading to the identification and apprehension of persons who willfully damage or destroy property. These amounts are adjusted annually for inflation by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. For 2019, the liability of a parent/guardian must not exceed $20,300 for damages and $20,300 for the reward. For situations not addressed by the Education Code, Civil Code 1714.1 provides for parent/guardian liability for the willful misconduct of their minor child which results in injury, death, or property damage. The limit under this statute is adjusted every two years for cost-of-living by the Judicial Council of California and, effective July 1, 2017, parent/guardian liability must not exceed $42,100.Pursuant to Penal Code 640.5 and 640.6, an individual who has been found to have defaced district property with graffiti may be fined or ordered by a court to perform community service. Depending on the amount of damage, Penal Code 594 also specifies that an individual, or the parent/guardian of a minor, who has been convicted of vandalism may be ordered to clean up and repair the property and to keep the property free from graffiti for one year.
The Governing Board desires to create a safe and secure learning environment and to minimize acts of vandalism and damage to school property. When district property is damaged due to the willful misconduct of a student or other person, the district shall seek reimbursement of damages, within the limitations specified in law, from the parent/guardian of a minor child or from any other responsible individual.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49014, as added by AB 1974 (Ch. 577, Statutes of 2018), the district may collect debt owed to the school by a student who willfully cuts, defaces, or otherwise injures district property or fails to return property that was loaned by the district, unless the student is a current or former homeless student or foster youth.
The district may collect debt owed by a student or former student as a result of vandalism or to cover the replacement cost of district books, supplies, or property loaned to a student that the student willfully fails to return or that is willfully cut, defaced, or otherwise injured. However, this policy shall not apply to a student who is a current or former homeless or foster child or youth.  (Education Code 48904, 49014)

Rewards

CSBA NOTE:  The following section is optional.
The Board may offer and pay a reward for information leading to the determination of the identity of, and the apprehension of, any person who willfully damages or destroys any district property.  (Government Code 53069.5)

CSBA NOTE: The Governing Board may set any amount for the reward it deems to be appropriate. However, as detailed above, Education Code 48904 specifies a limit on the amount of parent/guardian liability for repayment of the reward.Option 1 below allows the Superintendent or designee to offer a reward up to $2,500 without Board approval. Option 2 provides that the Board will determine the amount of any reward offered. Both options may be revised, including the specified reward amount, to reflect district practice.
OPTION 1:  The Board authorizes the Superintendent or designee to offer a reward in any amount deemed appropriate, not exceeding $2,500. A reward in excess of $2,500 shall be authorized in advance by the Board.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  The Board shall determine the appropriate amount for the reward.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph applies to all districts.
The Superintendent or designee shall disburse the reward when the guilt of the person responsible for the act has been established by a criminal conviction or other appropriate judicial procedure. If more than one person provides information, the reward shall be divided among them as appropriate.
