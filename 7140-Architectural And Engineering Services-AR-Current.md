## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: When applying for state facilities funding, the district will be required to certify that any professional design services used for the project were selected using a qualification-based selection process. The Office of Public School Construction's, "School Facility Program Handbook," advises districts to consult with legal counsel to ensure that its process for selecting architects or structural engineers is a qualification-based selection process and complies with all other legal requirements, including the Public Contract Code and requirements for disabled veterans business enterprises.
Contractors for any private architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, environmental, land surveying or construction project management services shall be selected, at fair and reasonable prices, on the basis of demonstrated competence and professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required.  (Government Code 4526)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 4526 requires that the district's selection process include at least Items #1-3 below; however, the law does not prescribe the exact procedures that must be followed. Generally, elements of a "competitive process" include advertising and notice of the need for services, objective evaluation and selection criteria, and an appeals process for use by those not selected. Districts may wish to develop procedures consistent with these and other requirements in consultation with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the selection process for projects receiving state funding:  (Government Code 4526)

	Assures maximum participation by small business firms as defined pursuant to Government Code 14837
	 
	Prohibits practices which might result in unlawful activity such as rebates, kickbacks, or other unlawful consideration
	 
	Prohibits district employees from participating in the selection process when they have a relationship with a person or business entity seeking a contract which would subject the employee to the prohibition of Government Code 87100

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 4527, the following items are optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The selection process may also include: (Government Code 4527)

	Evaluation of current statements of qualifications and performance data on file with the district and evaluation of statements that may be submitted by other firms regarding the proposed project
	 
	Discussion with at least three firms regarding anticipated concepts and the relative utility of alternative approaches for furnishing the required services
	 
	Selection, in order of preference, of at least three firms deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the required services in accordance with established district criteria

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice. Government Code 4528 authorizes, but does not require, the district to implement the following procedures.
The district shall negotiate a contract with the best qualified firm at compensation determined by the district to be fair and reasonable. If the district is unable to negotiate a contract with the most qualified firm, the district shall negotiate a contract with the second most qualified firm and, if unsuccessful, with the third most qualified firm. If the district is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the district shall select additional firms in order of their competence and qualification and continue negotiations until an agreement is reached.  (Government Code 4528)

The above procedures shall not apply if the Superintendent or designee determines that the services needed are more of a technical nature and involve little professional judgment and that requiring bids would be in the public interest.  (Government Code 4529)

Contracts shall specify that all plans, including, but not limited to, record drawings, specifications, and estimates prepared by the architect or structural engineer shall become the property of the district for the purpose of repair, maintenance, renovation, modernization, or other purposes, but only as they relate to the project for which the architect or structural engineer was retained. The contract shall also specify terms and conditions for reuse within the district of any plans prepared by the architect or structural engineer.  (Education Code 17316)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 17250.20 authorizes the district, until January 1, 2025, to utilize the design-build method of construction delivery for projects in excess of $1,000,000. Additionally, pursuant to Education Code 17250.60-017250.69, as added by AB 185 (Ch. 571, Statutes of 2022), the district may, until January 1, 2029, utilize alternative design-build contracts for public works projects in excess of $5,000,000. See AR 3311 - Bids and AR 3311.3 - Design-Build Contracts for more information regarding design-build.
A design-build contract may be awarded to a single entity for both design and construction of any school facility if the contract is in excess of $1,000,000, or an alternative design-build contract may be awarded if the contract is in excess of $5,000,000, as specified in Administrative Regulation 3311.3 - Design-Build Contracts.  (Education Code 17250.20, 17250.62)
