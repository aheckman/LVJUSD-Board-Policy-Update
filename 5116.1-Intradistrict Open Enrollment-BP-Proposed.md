## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide enrollment options that meet the diverse needs and interests of District students and parents/guardians, while also balancing enrollment in order to maximize the efficient use of District facilities. The Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures for the selection and transfer of students among District schools in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.
 

The parents/guardians of any student who resides within District boundaries may apply to enroll their child in any District school, regardless of the location of residence within the District. (Education Code 35160.5)
 

The Board shall annually review this policy. (Education Code 35160.5, 48980)
 

Enrollment Priorities
 

No student currently residing within a school's attendance area shall be displaced by another student transferring from outside the attendance area. (Education Code 35160.5)
 

The Superintendent or designee shall grant priority for the enrollment of a student in a District school outside of the student's attendance area, if the student:


	Is enrolled in a District school designated by the California Department of Education (CDE) as "persistently dangerous" (20 USC 7912; 5 CCR 11992)
	 
	Is a victim of a violent crime while on school grounds (20 USC 7912)
	 
	Is a victim of an act of bullying committed by another District student, as determined through an investigation following the parent/guardian's submission of a written complaint with the school, District, or local law enforcement agency pursuant to Education Code 234.1 (Education Code 46600)
	
	If the District school requested by the student is at maximum capacity, the Superintendent or designee shall assign an alternate school without requiring an intradistrict transfer request for another District school. (Education Code 46600)
	 
	Is currently enrolled in a District school identified by CDE for comprehensive support and improvement, with priority given to the lowest academically achieving students from low-income families as determined pursuant to 20 USC 6313(a)(3) (20 USC 6311)
	 
	Is experiencing special circumstances that might be harmful or dangerous to the student in the current attendance area, including, but not limited to, threats of bodily harm or threats to the emotional stability of the student. Any such student may transfer to a District school that is at capacity and otherwise closed to transfers. To grant priority under these circumstances, the Superintendent or designee must have received either: (Education Code 35160.5)
	 
	
		A written statement from a representative of an appropriate state or local agency, such as a law enforcement official, social worker, or a properly licensed or registered professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or marriage and family therapist
		 
		A court order, including a temporary restraining order and injunction
		 
	
	
	Any sibling of a student already in attendance in that school.
	 
	Any student whose parent/guardian is assigned to that school as his/her primary place of employment.
	Any student whose parent/guardian is an employee of LVJUSD regardless of work location assignment.


 

Application and Selection Process
 

In order to ensure that priorities for enrollment in District schools are implemented in accordance with law, applications for intradistrict open enrollment shall be submitted the year preceding the school year for which the transfer is requested, according to the timelines posted on the District's website.
 

The Superintendent or designee shall calculate each school's capacity in a non-arbitrary manner using student enrollment and available space. (Education Code 35160.5)
 

Except for priorities listed above, the Superintendent or designee shall use a random, unbiased selection process to determine who shall be admitted whenever the school receives admission requests that are in excess of the school's capacity. (Education Code 35160.5)
 

Enrollment decisions shall not be based on a student's academic or athletic performance, except that existing entrance criteria for specialized schools or programs may be used provided that the criteria are uniformly applied to all applicants. Academic performance may be used to determine eligibility for, or placement in, programs for gifted and talented students. (Education Code 35160.5)
