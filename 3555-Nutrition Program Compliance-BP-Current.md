## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is required for any district whose child nutrition programs (i.e., National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Special Milk Program, and/or other child nutrition program) receive state or federal funding. During the California Department of Education's (CDE) Administrative Review of the district's child nutrition programs, CDE will review whether the district has a written procedure that complies with requirements pertaining to civil rights and nondiscrimination.Various state and federal laws prohibit discrimination in district programs and activities on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, nationality, national origin, immigration status, ethnic group identification, ethnicity, age, religion, marital status, pregnancy, parental status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or genetic information; a perception of one or more of such characteristics; or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. See BP 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities.CDE's, "Civil Rights and Complaint Procedures, U.S. Department of Agriculture Child Nutrition Programs," and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA), "FNS Instruction 113-1, Civil Rights Compliance and Enforcement - Nutrition Programs and Activities," provide guidance to districts on how best to comply with federal law.
The Governing Board recognizes the district's responsibility to comply with state and federal nondiscrimination laws as they apply to the district's nutrition programs. The district shall not deny any individual the benefits or service of any nutrition program or discriminate on any basis prohibited by law.

Compliance Coordinator

CSBA NOTE: According to CDE's, "Civil Rights and Complaint Procedures, U.S. Department of Agriculture Child Nutrition Programs," districts are required to appoint a coordinator to be responsible for ensuring district compliance with law governing child nutrition programs. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Board shall designate a compliance coordinator for nutrition programs, who may also be the compliance officer(s) specified in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, to ensure compliance with the laws governing the district's nutrition programs.

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-10 below reflect the duties of the coordinator as provided in CDE's, "Civil Rights and Complaint Procedures, U.S. Department of Agriculture Child Nutrition Programs."
The responsibilities of the compliance coordinator include, but are not limited to:

	Providing the name of the compliance coordinator, the Section 504 coordinator, and Title IX coordinator, if different from the compliance coordinator, to the California Department of Education (CDE) and other interested parties
	 
	Annually providing mandatory civil rights training to all frontline staff who interact with program applicants or participants and to those who supervise frontline staff
	
	CSBA NOTE: "FNS Instruction 113-1" lists required components of training that must be provided to nutrition program staff, as provided below.
	The subject matter of such training shall include, but not be limited to, collection and use of data, effective public notification systems, complaint procedures, compliance review techniques, resolution of noncompliance, requirements for reasonable accommodation of persons with disabilities, requirements for language assistance, conflict resolution, and customer service.
	 
	Establishing admission and enrollment procedures that do not restrict enrollment of students on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or disability, including preventing staff from incorrectly denying applications and ensuring that such persons have equal access to all programs
	 
	Sending a public release announcing the availability of the child nutrition programs and/or changes in the programs to public media and to community and grassroots organizations that interact directly with eligible or potentially eligible participants
	 
	Communicating the program's nondiscrimination policy and applicable complaint procedures, as provided in the section "Notifications" below
	 
	Providing appropriate translation services when a significant number of persons in the surrounding population have limited English proficiency
	 
	Ensuring that every part of a facility is accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities and that participants with disabilities are not excluded from the benefits or services due to inaccessibility of facilities
	 
	Ensuring that special meals are made available to participants with disabilities who have a medical statement on file documenting that their disability restricts their diet
	 
	Implementing procedures to process and resolve civil rights complaints, including alleged discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and program-related complaints, including maintaining a complaint log, working with the appropriate person to resolve any complaint, and referring the complainant to the appropriate state or federal agency when necessary
	
	CSBA NOTE: Districts receiving federal financial assistance are required to request racial/ethnic data of all program applicants and participants for purposes of determining whether the program reaches potential eligible persons, identifying areas where additional outreach is needed, selecting locations for compliance reviews, and completing required reports. According to "FNS Instruction 113-1," using the applicant's self-identification or self-reporting is the preferred method of obtaining racial and ethnic data. When requesting such information, districts should be careful to not request any information in regard to the immigration status of students or their family members and, if such information is inadvertently received, to not disclose it to immigration enforcement authorities without parental consent, a court order, or judicial subpoena. See AR 5145.13 - Response to Immigration Enforcement.
	Developing a method, which preferably uses self-identification or self-reporting, to collect racial and ethnic data for potentially eligible populations, applicants, and participants

Notifications

The compliance coordinator shall ensure that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) "And Justice for All" civil rights poster, or a substitute poster approved by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, is displayed in areas visible to the district's nutrition program participants, such as food service areas and school offices.

CSBA NOTE: "FNS Instruction 113-1" requires districts to notify nutrition program applicants, participants, and potentially eligible persons of program availability, rights, and responsibilities and to advise them at each service delivery site (e.g., the school) regarding the procedure for filing a complaint. Such notice may be distributed through student and parent/guardian handbooks or other method of parent/guardian notifications.
The compliance coordinator shall notify the public, all program applicants, participants, and potentially eligible persons of their rights and responsibilities and steps necessary to participate in the nutrition programs, including program requirements and program availability. Applicants, participants, and the public also shall be advised of their right to file a complaint, how to file a complaint, the complaint procedures, and that a complaint may be filed anonymously or by a third party.

CSBA NOTE: As part of its instructions to all recipients of federal funds, USDA requires that all forms of communication available to the public regarding program availability also contain information about that recipient's status as an equal opportunity provider and the address of the agency with responsibility to handle complaints made against the recipient. USDA provides specific language for the notification and prohibits its modification in any way. The required language is available on USDA's web site and in the accompanying exhibit.
In addition, the compliance coordinator shall ensure that all forms of communication available to the public regarding program availability shall contain, in a prominent location, the most current version of the nondiscrimination statement provided by USDA about the district's status as an equal opportunity provider and the address of the agency with responsibility to handle complaints made against the district.

Forms of communication requiring this nondiscrimination statement include, but are not limited to, web sites, public information releases, publications, and posters, but exclude items such as cups, buttons, magnets, menus, and pens that identify the program when the size or configuration makes it impractical. The nondiscrimination statement need not be included on every page of program information on the district's or school's web site, but the statement or a link to the statement shall be included on the home page of the program information.

A short version of the nondiscrimination statement, as provided by USDA, may be used on pamphlets, brochures, and flyers in the same print size as the rest of the text.

Complaints of Discrimination

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 15582 requires allegations of discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability to be referred to USDA. Pursuant to USDA's CRD memorandum 01-2022, "Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint Processing," prohibited sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. Complaints of discrimination on any other basis are addressed through the district's UCP; see BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.For information about compliance complaints, see the section below on "Complaints Regarding Noncompliance with Program Requirements."

The district shall investigate and prepare a written report pursuant to 5 CCR 4631.  (5 CCR 15583)

CSBA NOTE: Option 1 below is for districts that do not allow complainants to appeal the compliance coordinator's decision to the Governing Board. Option 2 is for districts that allow appeals to the Board, and requires the coordinator's decision within 30 calendar days so that the Board's decision can still be given within the 60-day time limit.
OPTION 1: (No appeal permitted)

Unless extended by written agreement with the complainant, the district's compliance coordinator shall investigate the complaint and prepare a written report to be sent to the complainant within 60 days of the district's receipt of the complaint.  (5 CCR 15583; 5 CCR 4631)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2: (Appeal permitted)

The Board shall consider the matter at its next regular Board meeting or at a special Board meeting convened in order to meet the 60-day time limit within which the complaint must be answered pursuant to 5 CCR 4631. When required by law, the matter shall be considered in closed session. The Board may decide not to consider the complaint, in which case the coordinator's decision shall be final.

If the Board considers the complaint, the Board's decision shall be sent to the complainant within 60 calendar days of the district's initial receipt of the complaint or within the time period that has been specified in a written agreement with the complainant.  (5 CCR 4631)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by all districts.
If the complainant is not satisfied with the findings in the district's report, the complainant may appeal the decision to CDE by filing a written appeal within 30 days of receiving the decision.  (5 CCR 4632)
