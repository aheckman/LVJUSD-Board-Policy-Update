## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy and accompanying administrative regulation are subject to collective bargaining and should be revised in accordance with any applicable collective bargaining agreement. To the extent that this policy is inconsistent with provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement would prevail, so long as the provision is consistent with law. Pursuant to Government Code 3543.2, the district and the bargaining unit representing certificated employees must, upon request of either party, negotiate causes and procedures for disciplinary action, other than dismissal and suspension beyond 15 days.For information about dismissal of substitute or temporary employees, see BP 4121 - Temporary/Substitute Personnel.
The Governing Board expects all employees to perform their jobs satisfactorily, exhibit professional and appropriate conduct, and serve as positive role models both at school and in the community. A certificated employee may be disciplined for conduct or performance in accordance with law, the applicable collective bargaining agreement, Board policy, or administrative regulation.

CSBA NOTE: When disciplining an employee, the district must ensure that all of the surrounding facts and circumstances are considered and analyzed within the parameters of any applicable constitutional or legal framework. In Morrison v. State Board of Education, the court articulated multiple factors to determine fitness to teach; see the accompanying administrative regulation for these factors.Employee discipline, especially with respect to suspension and dismissal, involves complex legal considerations and districts are advised to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel, accordingly.
Disciplinary action shall be based on the particular facts and circumstances involved and the severity of the conduct or performance.

CSBA NOTE: In Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the district could not discipline an employee for non-coercive religious conduct while the employee was acting as a private citizen. For more information see the U.S. Department of Education's May 2023, "Guidance on Constitutionally Protected Prayer and Religious Expression in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools." Also see BP/AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment and BP 4119.1 - Civil and Legal Rights.In Visalia Unified School District v. Public Employment Relations Board (PERB), the Fifth District Court of Appeal upheld PERB's determination that service as a union officer constitutes protected activity under the Educational Employment Relations Act for purposes of the employee's complaint of retaliation for union activities and that the district retaliated against the employee. However, the court ultimately held in favor of the district, finding that the district proved it would have terminated the employee for poor performance regardless of the protected union activity. Districts with questions about disciplining an officer of an employee organization are encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that disciplinary actions are appropriately documented and taken in a consistent, nondiscriminatory manner. In addition, an employee shall not be suspended, disciplined, reassigned, transferred, dismissed, or otherwise retaliated against solely for engaging in protected activities, or for acting to protect a student engaged in exercising any free speech or press right authorized by, or for refusing to infringe upon a student's conduct protected pursuant to, Education Code 48907 or 48950.

Disciplinary actions may include, but are not limited to, verbal and written warnings, suspension or leave without pay, or dismissal.

Suspension/Dismissal Procedures

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44932 and 44933 specify the causes for which a certificated employee may be suspended without pay or dismissed; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Superintendent shall notify the Board whenever there is cause to suspend or dismiss an employee pursuant to Education Code 44932 or 44933.

When the Board finds that there is cause to suspend or dismiss an employee pursuant to Education Code 44932 or 44933, it may formulate a written statement of charges specifying instances of behavior and the acts or omissions constituting the charge, the statutes and rules that the employee is alleged to have violated when applicable, and the facts relevant to each charge. The Board shall also review any duly signed and verified written statement of charges filed by any other person.  (Education Code 44934, 44934.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44934 and 44934.1, upon the formulation or receipt of a written statement of charges, the Governing Board may notify the employee of the Board's intent to suspend or dismiss the employee.
Based on the written statement of charges, the Board may, upon majority vote, give notice to the employee of the Board's intention to suspend or dismiss the employee at the expiration of 30 days from the date the notice is served.  (Education Code 44934, 44934.1)

CSBA NOTE: Prior to serving the notice of suspension or dismissal, Education Code 44938 requires that, when the charge involves unsatisfactory performance or unprofessional conduct, the employee must be given time to correct the performance or conduct as provided in the following two paragraphs. According to Crowl v. Commission on Professional Competence, when the employee fully remediates the misconduct specified in the written notice, no disciplinary action may be taken. The Crowl decision did not address what could be done when the misconduct specified in the notice reoccurs. Because the lack of further misconduct may not necessarily be equal to full remediation, appropriate disciplinary action should be determined on a case-by-case basis in consultation with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel and the collective bargaining agreement.
Prior to serving a suspension or dismissal notice that includes a charge of unsatisfactory performance, the district shall give the employee written notice of the unsatisfactory performance that specifies the nature of the unsatisfactory performance with such specific instances of behavior and with such particularity as to furnish the employee an opportunity to correct the faults and overcome the grounds for any unsatisfactory performance charges and, if applicable, that includes the evaluation made pursuant to Education Code 44660-44665. The written notice of the unsatisfactory performance shall be provided at least 90 days prior to the filing of the suspension or dismissal notice or prior to the last one-fourth of the school days in the year.  (Education Code 44938)

Prior to serving a suspension or dismissal notice that includes a charge of unprofessional conduct, the district shall give the employee written notice that describes the nature of the unprofessional conduct with such specific instances of behavior and with such particularity as to furnish the employee an opportunity to correct the faults and overcome the grounds for any unprofessional conduct charges and, if applicable, that includes the evaluation made pursuant to Education Code 44660-44665. The written notice of the unprofessional conduct shall be provided at least 45 days prior to the filing of the suspension or dismissal notice.  (Education Code 44938)

Except for notices that only include charges of unsatisfactory performance, the written suspension or dismissal notice may be served at any time of year. Such notice shall be served upon the employee personally if given outside of the instructional year or, if given during the instructional year, may be served personally or by registered mail to the employee's last known address. Notices with a charge of unsatisfactory performance shall be given only during the instructional year of the school site where the employee is physically employed and may be served personally or by registered mail to the employee's last known address.  (Education Code 44936)

If an employee has been served notice and demands a hearing pursuant to Government Code 11505 and 11506, the Board shall either rescind its action or schedule a hearing on the matter.  (Education Code 44941, 44941.1, 44943, 44944)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44939 and 44939.1, the Board may immediately suspend an employee from performing assigned duties pending suspension or dismissal proceedings for specified causes.Pursuant to Education Code 44939, an employee who is immediately suspended for a charge other than egregious misconduct may, within 30 days of receiving the suspension notice, serve the Board and file a motion with the Office of Administrative Hearings to seek reversal of the suspension. The review will be limited to whether the facts as alleged in the statement of charges would be a sufficient basis for immediate suspension. A hearing will be held no later than 30 days after the motion is filed, and the administrative law judge will issue a decision no later than 15 days after the hearing. During the review of the motion or while dismissal charges are pending, the Board retains the authority to determine the physical placement and assignment of the employee.
Pending suspension or dismissal proceedings for an employee who is charged with egregious misconduct, immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude, incompetency due to mental disability, or willful refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause as prescribed by district rules and regulations, the Board may, if it deems it necessary, immediately suspend the employee from assigned duties. If the employee files a motion with the Office of Administrative Hearings for immediate reversal of the suspension based on a cause other than egregious misconduct, the Board may file a written response before or at the time of the hearing.  (Education Code 44939, 44939.1)

CSBA NOTE: If an employee has requested a hearing upon receiving notice of suspension or dismissal, the hearing will be conducted by the Commission on Professional Competence or an administrative law judge pursuant to Education Code 44944 or 44944.1; see the accompanying administrative regulation. The hearing before the Commission on Professional Competence must begin within six months of the employee's request for the hearing, unless extended due to extraordinary circumstances. The Commission on Professional Competence consists of an administrative law judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings, a member appointed by the Board, and a member appointed by the employee.
When a suspension or dismissal hearing is to be conducted by a Commission on Professional Competence, the Board shall, no later than 45 days before the date set for the hearing, select one person with a currently valid credential to serve on the Commission. The appointee shall not be an employee of the district and shall have at least three years' experience within the past 10 years at the same grade span or assignment as the employee, as defined in Education Code 44944.  (Education Code 44944)

Compulsory Leave of Absence

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44940 and 44940.5, the district is required to place an employee charged with a "mandatory leave of absence offense" on a compulsory leave of absence; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
Upon being informed that a certificated employee has been charged with a mandatory leave of absence offense, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately place the employee on a compulsory leave of absence.  (Education Code 44940, 44940.5)

Because the lack of further misconduct may not necessarily be equal to full remediation, appropriate disciplinary action should be determined on a case-by-case basis in consultation with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel and the collective bargaining agreement.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="yNTgOQ5" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22yNTgOQ5%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22yNQ132%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1710206072%2C%22text%22%3A%22Prior%20to%20serving%20the%20notice%20of%20suspension%20or%20dismissal%2C%20Education%20Code%2044938%20requires%20that%2C%20when%20the%20charge%20involves%20unsatisfactory%20performance%20or%20unprofessional%20conduct%2C%20the%20employee%20must%20be%20given%20time%20to%20correct%20the%20performance%20or%20conduct%20as%20provided%20in%20the%20following%20two%20paragraphs.%20According%20to%20Crowl%20v.%20Commission%20on%20Professional%20Competence%2C%20when%20the%20employee%20fully%20remediates%20the%20misconduct%20specified%20in%20the%20written%20notice%2C%20no%20disciplinary%20action%20may%20be%20taken.%20The%20Crowl%20decision%20did%20not%20address%20what%20could%20be%20done%20when%20the%20misconduct%20specified%20in%20the%20notice%20reoccurs.%20Because%20the%20lack%20of%20further%20misconduct%20may%20not%20necessarily%20be%20equal%20to%20full%20remediation%2C%20appropriate%20disciplinary%20action%20should%20be%20determined%20on%20a%20case-by-case%20basis%20in%20consultation%20with%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel%20and%20the%20collective%20bargaining%20agreement.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-yNTgOQ5" title="CSBA NOTE: Prior to serving the notice of suspensi..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
