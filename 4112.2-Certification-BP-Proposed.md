## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that the District's ability to provide a high-quality educational program is dependent upon the employment of certificated staff who are adequately prepared and have demonstrated proficiency in basic skills and competency in the subject matter to be taught. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that persons employed to fill positions requiring certification qualifications possess the appropriate credential, permit, or other certification document from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) and fulfill any additional state, federal, or District requirements for the position.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide assistance and support to teachers holding preliminary credentials to enable them to meet the qualifications required for the clear credential.

Priorities for Hiring Based on Unavailability of Credentialed Teacher

The Superintendent or designee shall make reasonable efforts to recruit a fully prepared teacher who is authorized in the subject or setting for each assignment or, when necessary, a fully prepared teacher serving on a local assignment option. Whenever a teacher with a clear or preliminary credential is not available, and the Board adopts a resolution that it has made reasonable efforts to recruit a fully prepared teacher for the assignment, the Superintendent or designee shall make reasonable efforts to recruit an individual for the assignment in the following order:  (Education Code 44225.7)

	A candidate who enrolls in an approved internship program in the region of the District and possesses an intern credential
	 
	A candidate who is scheduled to complete preliminary credential requirements within six months and who is granted a provisional internship permit (PIP) or short-term staff permit issued by CTC
	
	The Board shall take action to approve, at an open Board meeting, a notice of its intent to employ a PIP applicant for a specific position.  (5 CCR 80021.1)
	 
	An individual who has been granted a credential waiver by CTC

Annually, the Board shall, prior to requesting that CTC issue an emergency permit or limited assignment permit, approve a Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators. The Declaration of Need shall be approved by the Board as an action item at a regularly scheduled open Board meeting, with the entire Declaration of Need being included in the Board agenda  (Education Code 44225, 44225.7; 5 CCR 80023.2, 80026, 80027, 80027.1)

The Declaration of Need shall certify that there is an insufficient number of certificated persons who meet the District's specified employment criteria for the position(s) and that the District has made reasonable efforts to recruit individuals who meet the qualifications specified in Items #1-2 above. The Declaration of Need shall also indicate the number and type of emergency permits and limited assigned permits that the District estimates it will need during the valid period of the Declaration of Need, based on the previous year's actual needs and projections of enrollment. It shall also specify each subject to be listed on the General Education Limited Assignment Single Subject Teaching Permits and the target language on Emergency Bilingual Permits. Whenever the actual number of permits needed exceeds the estimate by 10 percent, the Board shall revise and resubmit the Declaration of Need.  (5 CCR 80026)

Whenever it is necessary to employ noncredentialed teachers to fill a position requiring certification qualifications, the Superintendent or designee shall provide support and guidance in accordance with law to ensure the quality of the instructional program.

National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification

The Superintendent or designee shall promote a career continuum that includes participation of District teachers in professional learning that supports their completion of advanced certification awarded by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS). The Superintendent or designee may coordinate a cohort of teachers through school or District programs or other available networks.

With Board approval and funding, and consistent with the collective bargaining agreement and applicable law, the Superintendent may provide an incentive program for teacher participation in NBPTS certification, which may include:

	Defraying, subsidizing, or reimbursing the registration, certification, or maintenance fees for NBPTS certification
	 
	Providing bonuses, step increases, or differential pay for teachers who maintain their certification and continue to teach in the District, with priority given to teachers at Title I schools and schools serving a majority of low-income students
	 
	Providing substitute teachers to provide release time for participating teachers
	 
	Providing stipends for teacher participation that match other professional development stipends
	 
	Compensating mentor teachers who support other teachers' professional learning aligned to NBPTS standards

Parental Notifications

At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the parents/guardians of each student attending a school receiving Title I funds that they may request information regarding the professional qualifications of their child's classroom teacher including, but not limited to, whether the teacher:  (20 USC 6312)

	Has met state qualification and licensing criteria for the grade levels and subject areas in which the teacher provides instruction
	 
	Is teaching under emergency or other provisional status through which state qualification or licensing criteria have been waived
	 
	Is teaching in the field of discipline of the teacher's certification

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians in a timely manner whenever their child has been assigned, or has been taught for four or more consecutive weeks by, a teacher who does not meet applicable state certification or licensure requirements at the grade level and subject area to which the teacher has been assigned.  (20 USC 6312)
