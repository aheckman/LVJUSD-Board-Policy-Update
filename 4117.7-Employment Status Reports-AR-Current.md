## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44030.5 and 44242.5 and 5 CCR 80303 require the Superintendent to make a report to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) when the employment status of a certificated employee has been changed as a result of alleged misconduct or while an allegation of misconduct is pending.  Upon notification by the district or other specified agencies, CTC may conduct a review and take an adverse action against the certificated employee, including, but not limited to, suspension or revocation of the credential.Pursuant to 5 CCR 80303, the report must be made regardless of any proposed or actual agreement, settlement, or stipulation between the district and the employee not to make such a report.  The report must also be made if the allegations are withdrawn in consideration of the employee's resignation, retirement, or other failure to contest the truth of the allegations.Pursuant to Education Code 44030.5 and 5 CCR 80303, as amended, the Superintendent's failure to make the report of the change in employment status or to notify the affected employee of the contents of 5 CCR 80303 would be considered unprofessional conduct and, if it is determined that the Superintendent refused or willfully neglected to make the report, the Superintendent may be found guilty of a misdemeanor and fined.
The Superintendent shall report to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) any change in the employment status of a certificated employee who, while working in a position requiring a credential and as a result of an allegation of misconduct or while an allegation of misconduct is pending:  (Education Code 44030.5, 44242.5; 5 CCR 80303)

	Is suspended or placed on unpaid administrative leave for more than 10 days as a final adverse employment action
	 
	Retires
	 
	Is otherwise terminated by a decision not to employ or reemploy

This report is not required when the change in employment status is due solely to unsatisfactory performance pursuant to Education Code 44932 or a reduction in force pursuant to Education Code 44955-44958.  (Education Code 44030.5, 44242.5; 5 CCR 80303)

The report should be made using a notification form available on CTC's web site and attaching relevant documents, evidence, and materials related to the district's investigation of the misconduct.
When required, the report of a change in employment status shall be submitted not later than 30 days after the employment action. The report shall be made using a form provided by CTC and shall include all known information about each alleged act of misconduct by the employee. The report shall contain the name and current address of the certificated employee, name of the district, last school or district assignment, an explanation of the allegation of misconduct or pending allegation of misconduct, current contact information for all persons who may have information relating to the alleged misconduct, and any and all documentation related to the case.  (Education Code 44030.5; 5 CCR 80303)

Also see AR 4118 - Dismissal/Suspension/Disciplinary Action. Upon receiving notification from the district regarding any such offense, CTC will automatically suspend the employee's credential.

	CSBA NOTE: According to CTC's notification form, submission of this notification to CTC does not relieve the district of the obligation to also submit an employment status report of the same misconduct when the district takes disciplinary action resulting in a change in employment status.
	If the offense results in a change in employment status, the Superintendent shall submit an employment status report in addition to the report of the mandatory leave of absence offense.
	 
	An employee refuses, without good cause, to fulfill a valid employment contract, or departs from district service without the consent of the Superintendent or Governing Board.  (Education Code 44242.5, 44420)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44242.5 gives CTC authority to review any of the violations described in items #1-3 below upon receiving notice from a district.  Since the law does not require districts to report these violations to CTC, the district should revise the following list to identify the types of violations that it will report and then ensure consistent implementation.
As appropriate, the Superintendent or designee also shall notify CTC of any of the following:
