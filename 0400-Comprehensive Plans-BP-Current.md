## Policy Content

The Governing Board believes that careful planning is essential to effective implementation of district programs and policies. Comprehensive plans shall identify cohesive strategies for school improvement, provide stability in district operations, and be aligned to ensure consistency among district approaches for student academic growth and achievement.

Comprehensive plans adopted by the district shall include the local control and accountability plan (LCAP) and other plans required by law or determined by the Board to be in the best interest of the district. Such plans may describe anticipated short- and long-term needs, measurable outcomes, priorities, activities, available resources, timelines, staff responsibilities, and strategies for internal and external communications regarding the plan.

The process for developing comprehensive plans shall include broad participation of school and community representatives. Committees may, and when required by law shall, be appointed to assist in the development of such plans. District comprehensive plans are subject to review and approval by the Board.

CSBA NOTE: In certain situations, school-level plans are required. For example, each school that participates in specified state and/or federal categorical programs must establish a school site council for the purpose of developing and approving a school plan for student achievement pursuant to Education Code 64001; see BP/AR 0420 - School Plans/Site Councils. In districts with over 2,500 average daily attendance, each school must develop a school safety plan pursuant to Education Code 32281 and 32286; see BP/AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan. Other school-level plans may be required by law or Board policy or developed at the discretion of the school site.
School-level plans may be developed to meet the unique circumstances of individual school sites, provided that they are consistent with law, Board policies, district administrative regulations, the district vision, the LCAP, and other districtwide plans. School plans shall be subject to review and approval of the Superintendent or designee, except when law or Board policy requires Board approval of the plan.

Comprehensive plans shall be available to the public, and shall be reviewed and updated at regular intervals as specified within the plan or required by law.
