## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 60119 requires the Governing Board to hold a public hearing on the sufficiency of instructional materials. As part of the Williams settlement, SB 550 (Ch. 900, Statutes of 2004) amended Education Code 60119 to define "sufficient textbooks or instructional materials" to mean that each student, including each English learner, has a textbook and/or instructional material to use in class and to take home to complete homework assignments in the following subjects: mathematics, science, history/social science, and English/language arts. The law does not require two sets of textbooks or materials for each student. In addition, photocopied sheets from only a portion of a text or material copied to address a shortage are not considered ?sufficient? for these purposes. See BP/AR 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials for details regarding the sufficiency hearing.In order to ensure "sufficiency," districts should ensure that a replacement instructional material is provided when a student?s instructional materials are lost or damaged so as to be no longer usable. However, as specified below, Education Code 48904 still authorizes districts to charge for the replacement of damaged instructional materials and to withhold the student's grades or transcripts until reparation is provided. The following optional policy may be modified to reflect district practice. 
The Governing Board recognizes that instructional materials are an expensive resource and that each student is entitled to sufficient instructional materials in accordance with law.  Instructional materials provided for use by students remain the property of the district.  Students are responsible for returning borrowed materials in good condition, with no more wear and tear than usually results from normal use.

When materials are lost or so damaged that they are no longer usable, the student shall be immediately issued a replacement material.  However, students or parents/guardians shall be responsible for reparation equal to the current replacement cost of the materials.  When materials are damaged but still usable, the Superintendent or designee shall determine an appropriate charge.

If it can be demonstrated to the Superintendent or designee's satisfaction that the student has taken all reasonable precautions to safeguard instructional materials issued to him/her, the Superintendent or designee may excuse the student or parent/guardian from payment of reparation.

CSBA NOTE: Prior to withholding a student's grades, diploma or transcript, Education Code 48904 requires the district to provide the student due process rights, including parent/guardian notification of the misconduct. See AR 5125.2 - Withholding of Grades, Diplomas or Transcripts for sample due process procedures.
If reparation is not excused and not paid by the student or parent/guardian, the district may withhold the student's grades, diploma and transcripts in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.
