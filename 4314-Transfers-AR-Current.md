## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation addresses the transfer of administrative or supervisory employees between identical positions and should be modified to reflect district practice.  For language regarding the release/reassignment of an employee to the classroom or a different position, see BP/AR 4313.2 - Demotion/Reassignment.
Involuntary Transfer

CSBA NOTE: The Education Code does not require notification or a specific reason to transfer an administrative or supervisory employee to the same position at a different location.  However, in some circumstances, legal counsel should be consulted as to whether the district should provide notice or other due process rights.
Before recommending the transfer or lateral rotation of an employee, the Superintendent or designee shall confer with the affected employee and notify him/her of the intent to recommend the transfer.  For transfers effective at the beginning of the school year, this conference shall take place before May 30.  Affected employees shall be notified of the final decision, in writing, as soon as practicable.

Voluntary Transfer

The employee shall submit a transfer request to the Superintendent or designee at the time of the known vacancy.  The employee shall be notified in writing of the decision whether or not to grant the transfer request.

Transfer requests may be withdrawn by the employee at any time prior to the final decision.
