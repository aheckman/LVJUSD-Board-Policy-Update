Assignment to Departmentalized Classes Outside Credential Authorization

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44258.3 allows the Governing Board to assign the holder of a credential (including a provisional internship permit or short-term staff permit, but not an emergency permit) to teach any subject in departmentalized classes in any of grades K-12 provided that the Board first verifies that the teacher has adequate knowledge of each subject to be taught. If the district chooses to make such assignments, Education Code 44258.3 mandates the Board to establish policies and procedures, with specified components, for verifying the adequacy of these teachers' subject matter knowledge. Subject matter specialists as identified below must be involved in the development and implementation of these procedures. For further information, see the Commission on Teacher Credentialing's (CTC) Administrator's Assignment Manual.
Any holder of a credential other than an emergency permit may be assigned, with consent, to teach departmentalized classes in grades K-12 regardless of the designations on the teaching credential, provided that the teacher's subject matter knowledge is verified prior to the assignment.  (Education Code 44258.3)

Procedures for verifying a teacher's subject matter knowledge shall be developed and implemented by the Superintendent or designee with the involvement of appropriate subject matter specialists, including curriculum specialists, resource teachers, classroom teachers certified to teach the subject, staff assigned to regional subject matter projects or curriculum institutes, or college faculty.  (Education Code 44258.3)

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-2 below may be revised to reflect procedures and criteria established by the district.
Procedures to be used for this purpose shall specify:  (Education Code 44258.3)

	One or more of the following ways in which subject matter competence shall be assessed:
	 
	
		Observation by subject matter specialists
		 
		Oral interviews
		 
		Demonstration lessons
		 
		Presentation of curricular portfolios
		 
		Written examinations
		​​​​​​​
	
	
	Specific criteria and standards for verifying subject matter knowledge by any of the above methods. These criteria shall include, but need not be limited to, evidence of the individual's knowledge of the subject matter to be taught, including demonstrated knowledge of the curriculum framework for the subject and the specific content of the district's course of study for the subject at the grade level to be taught.

Whenever a teacher is assigned to teach departmentalized classes pursuant to Education Code 44258.3, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the exclusive representative of the district's certificated employees.  (Education Code 44258.3)

Assignment to Elective Courses Outside Credential Authorization

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional.  Education Code 44258.7 authorizes districts to assign a teacher to an elective course outside the teacher's credential authorization provided that the teacher has special skills and preparation in that subject area and the assignment is approved by a local committee on assignments.In order to make such assignments, the district must submit a plan to the County Superintendent of Schools which includes, but is not limited to, statements signed by the Board president or chair and the Superintendent approving the establishment of the committee, procedures for the selection of committee members, term of office for committee members, and criteria for determining teachers' qualifications for these assignments.Pursuant to Education Code 44258.7, an "elective course" for this purpose is a course other than English, mathematics, science, or social science. The CTC's Administrator's Assignment Manual clarifies that whether a course is considered to be within these subject areas or an elective depends on whether students in the class receive graduation credit for the subject area. For instance, if a drama, speech, or journalism course grants graduation credit for English, then it cannot be taught by a teacher outside of the teacher's credential authorization under this option.  However, if the course does not grant credit for English, then a teacher may be approved by the committee on assignments to teach the course outside the credential authorization.
A full-time teacher with special skills and preparation outside the credential authorization may, with the teacher's consent and the prior approval of a district committee on assignments, be assigned to teach an elective course in the area of the special skills or preparation, excluding a course in English, mathematics, science, or social studies.  (Education Code 44258.7)

The Superintendent or designee shall establish a committee on assignments, consisting of an equal number of teachers selected by teachers and school administrators selected by school administrators, to approve such assignments.  (Education Code 44258.7)

CSBA NOTE: The following two paragraphs are optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Committee members shall serve a two-year term but may be reappointed using the same procedure as the initial appointment.

When determining whether a teacher is qualified for an assignment pursuant to Education Code 44258.7, the committee may consider the teacher's education, prior experience, observation by subject matter specialists, oral interviews, demonstration lessons, presentation of curricular portfolios, and/or written examinations.

Assignments approved by the committee shall be for a maximum of one school year, but may be extended by action of the committee upon application by the principal and teacher.  (Education Code 44258.7)

Assignment to Special Schedules

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that operate one or more schools with year-round schedules in addition to schools with traditional schedules.
The Superintendent or designee shall make every reasonable effort to accommodate the preferences of certificated staff when assigning them to schools with year-round or regular schedules.  (Education Code 37616)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that have established weekend classes; see AR 6176 - Weekend/Saturday Classes.
Full-time probationary or permanent classroom teachers employed by the district prior to implementation of weekend classes shall not, without their written consent, be required to teach for more than 180 full days during a school year or for more than the number of full days during the preceding school year, whichever is greater. No teacher shall be assigned to work on a Saturday or Sunday if the teacher objects in writing that such assignment would conflict with religious beliefs or practices.  (Education Code 44824)
