## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48070 and 48070.5 mandate that the Governing Board adopt a policy, at a public meeting, regarding the promotion and retention of students, including, but not limited to, promotion and retention at specified grade levels and with specified provisions.
The Governing Board expects students to progress through each grade level within one school year.  Toward this end, instruction shall be designed to accommodate the variety of ways that students learn and provide strategies for addressing academic deficiencies as needed.

Students shall progress through the grade levels by demonstrating growth in learning and meeting grade-level standards of expected student achievement.

When high academic achievement is evident, the teacher may recommend a student for acceleration to a higher grade level.  The student's maturity level shall be taken into consideration in making a determination to accelerate a student.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48070.5 mandates that the Board's policy provide for the identification of students who should be retained and who are at risk of being retained at the end of grades 2, 3, 4, the intermediate grades (usually grade 6), and the middle school grades (usually grade 8). Items #1-5 below should be revised to reflect the grade levels offered by the district. If the Board chooses to expand these requirements to cover other grade levels, the following list should be revised accordingly.Education Code 48070.5 further mandates that the Board's policy provide for students to be identified as early in the school year, and as early in their school careers, as practicable.
Teachers shall identify students who should be retained or who are at risk of being retained at their current grade level as early as possible in the school year and as early in their school careers as practicable. Such students shall be identified at the following grade levels:  (Education Code 48070.5)

	Between grades 2 and 3
	 
	Between grades 3 and 4
	 
	Between grades 4 and 5
	
	CSBA NOTE: If all the schools in the district are configured in the same manner, the district may specify the actual grade levels in items #4 and 5 below (e.g., between grades 6 and 7, between grades 8 and 9).
	Between the end of the intermediate grades and the beginning of the middle school grades
	 
	Between the end of the middle school grades and the beginning of the high school grades

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48070.5 mandates that the district's policy establish the basis for identifying students who should be retained and who are at risk of being retained. If a student performs below the minimum standard based on indicators established by the district, the student shall be retained, unless the teacher determines that retention is not the appropriate intervention for the student's academic deficiencies; see the accompanying administrative regulation.Pursuant to Education Code 48070.5, the district may use either of the following: (1) the student's grades and other indicators of academic achievement designated by the district (Option 1 below) or (2) the results of state assessments administered pursuant to Education Code 60640-60649 and minimum levels of proficiency recommended by the State Board of Education (SBE) (Option 2 below). With regard to students with special needs, the determination as to the appropriate standards for promotion or retention should be made as part of the individualized education program process; see BP/AR 6159 - Individualized Education Program.Education Code 48070.5 provides that, when a district chooses to identify students on the basis of grades pursuant to Option 1, the Board shall also designate other indicators of academic achievement that will be used. These other indicators of achievement (e.g., state or district assessments, portfolios, attendance) should be specified in the blanks provided below.
OPTION 1:  Students shall be identified for retention on the basis of failure to meet minimum levels of proficiency, as indicated by grades and the following additional indicators of academic achievement:
______________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: According to the California Department of Education's (CDE) "FAQs Pupil Promotion and Retention," student results from the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress may be included as indicators of academic achievement for the purpose of identifying students for promotion or retention as provided in Option 2 below, but should not be the only criterion until minimum performance levels for this purpose have been established by CDE. Other indicators of achievement (e.g., grades, district assessments, portfolios, attendance) should be specified in the blanks provided below.
OPTION 2:  Students shall be identified for retention on the basis of failure to meet minimum levels of proficiency, as indicated by the results of state assessments administered pursuant to Education Code 60640-60649 and the following additional indicators of academic achievement:
______________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this policy is for use by all districts.
Students between grades 2 and 3 and grades 3 and 4 shall be identified primarily on the basis of their level of proficiency in reading.  Proficiency in reading, English language arts, and mathematics shall be the basis for identifying students between grades 4 and 5, between intermediate and middle school grades, and between middle school grades and high school grades.  (Education Code 48070.5)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48070.5 mandates that the district's policy specify the teacher(s) responsible for the promotion/retention decision in cases where the student does not have a single regular classroom teacher. The following paragraph should be revised to indicate the specific teacher(s) who will be responsible (e.g., teachers responsible for core subjects).
If a student does not have a single regular classroom teacher, the Superintendent or designee shall specify the teacher(s) responsible for the decision to promote or retain the student.  (Education Code 48070.5)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48070.5 mandates that the district's policy include a process by which the teacher's decision to promote or retain a student may be appealed; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
The teacher's decision to promote or retain a student may be appealed in accordance with AR 5123 - Promotion/Acceleration/Retention.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48070.5, the Board must adopt policy indicating the manner in which supplemental instruction will be provided to students who are recommended for retention or are identified as being at risk for retention. See BP 6179 - Supplemental Instruction for language fulfilling this mandate.
When any student in grades 2-9 is recommended for retention or is identified as being at risk for retention, the Superintendent or designee shall offer an appropriate program of remedial instruction to assist the student in meeting grade-level expectations.  (Education Code 48070.5)
