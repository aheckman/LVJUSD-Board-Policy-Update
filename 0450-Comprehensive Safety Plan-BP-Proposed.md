## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that students and staff have the right to a safe and secure campus where they are free from physical and psychological harm. The Board is fully committed to maximizing school safety and to creating a positive learning environment that includes strategies for violence prevention and high expectations for staff and student conduct, responsible behavior, and respect for others.

The school site council at each District school shall develop a comprehensive school safety plan (CSSP) relevant to the needs and resources of that particular school. New school campuses shall develop a CSSP within one year of initiating operations.  (Education Code 32281, 32286)

The CSSP shall take into account the school's staffing, available resources, and building design, as well as other factors unique to the school site.

The CSSP(s) shall be reviewed and updated by March 1 of each year and forwarded to the Board for approval.  (Education Code 32286, 32288)

The Board shall review the comprehensive safety plan(s) in order to ensure compliance with state law, Board policy, and administrative regulation and shall approve the plan(s) at a regularly scheduled meeting.

As necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall provide CSSP training to all school staff.

By October 15 of each year, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the California Department of Education (CDE) of any schools that have not complied with the requirements of Education Code 32281.  (Education Code 32288)

Tactical Response Plan

Notwithstanding the process described above, any portion of a CSSP that addresses tactical responses to criminal incidents that may result in death or serious bodily injury at the school site, including steps to safeguard students and staff, secure affected school premises, and apprehend criminal perpetrator(s), shall be developed by the Superintendent or designee in accordance with Education Code 32281. In developing such strategies, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with law enforcement officials and with representative(s) of employee bargaining unit(s), if they choose to participate.

When reviewing the tactical response plan, the Board may meet in closed session to confer with law enforcement officials and approve the tactical response plan, provided that any vote to approve the tactical response plan is announced in open session following the closed session.  (Education Code 32281)

Safety Plan(s) Access and Reporting

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that an updated file of all safety-related plans and materials is readily available for inspection by the public.  (Education Code 32282)

However, those portions of the CSSP that include tactical responses to criminal incidents need not be publicly disclosed.

The Superintendent or designee shall share the CSSPs and any updates to the plans with local law enforcement, the local fire department, and other first responder entities.  (Education Code 32281)

The Superintendent or designee shall also provide data to CDE pertaining to lockdown or multi-option response drills conducted at District schools in accordance with Education Code 32289.5.  (Education Code 32289.5)
