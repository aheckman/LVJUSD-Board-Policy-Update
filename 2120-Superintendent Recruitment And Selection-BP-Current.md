## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. 
The Governing Board recognizes that it has a direct responsibility to select and employ the Superintendent. Whenever it becomes necessary for the Board to fill a vacancy in the position of Superintendent, the Board shall work diligently to employ a person whose management and leadership abilities are most closely aligned with district needs.

The Board shall establish and implement a search and selection process that includes consideration of:

	The district's current and long-term needs, including a review of the district's vision and goals
	 
	The desired characteristics of a new Superintendent, including professional experience, educational qualifications, leadership characteristics, philosophy of education, and other management, technical, interpersonal and conceptual skills, as well as the priorities the Board wants to place on different abilities, traits and levels of knowledge
	 
	The scope of the search, including whether to promote from within the district or broaden the search to include both internal and external candidates and, if external candidates will be considered, whether to conduct a statewide or nationwide search
	 
	The salary range and benefits to be offered
	 
	Basic elements to be included in the Superintendent's contract
	 
	Whether to hire a professional adviser to facilitate the process
	 
	How and when to involve the community in certain phases of the selection process
	 
	The best methods for advertising the vacancy and recruiting qualified candidates
	 
	The process for screening applications and determining how the screener(s) will be selected
	 
	Interview questions, processes and participants
	 
	How and when candidates' qualifications will be verified through reference checks
	 
	Other actions necessary to ensure a fair selection process and a smooth transition to new leadership

Even if a professional adviser is used to facilitate the process, the Board shall retain the right and responsibility to oversee the process and to review all applications if desired.

The Board shall select candidates to be interviewed based on recommendations of the screener(s) and the Board's own assessment of how candidates meet the criteria established by the Board.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54957, specified personnel matters, including interviews and deliberation of the appointment or employment of an employee, may be discussed in closed session as provided in the following paragraph. See BB 9321 - Closed Session Purposes and Agendas. 
The Board shall interview preliminary and final candidates in closed session and determine the most likely match for the district. (Government Code 54957)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35029 authorizes the Board to waive the credential requirements of Education Code 35028. However, Education Code 35029.1, added by AB 96 (Ch. 135, Statutes of 2001), prohibits a district from employing a superintendent whose credential has been revoked by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. 
The selected candidate shall hold both a valid school administration certificate and a valid teacher's certificate.  The Board may waive any credential requirement, but shall not employ a person whose credential has been revoked by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing pursuant to Education Code 44421-44427.  (Education Code 35028, 35029, 35029.1)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54954, as amended by SB 1771 (Ch. 257, Statutes of 2004), authorizes a quorum of the Board to meet in another district to (1) interview members of the public about the potential employment of an applicant for superintendent, and (2) interview a potential employee from that district. Previously, Government Code 54954 only authorized the Board to interview members of the public when the Board was considering hiring the superintendent from the other district. See BB 9320 - Meetings and Notices. If less than a quorum of the Board participates in an interview, the Brown Act may not apply. Because this is a complex area of law, it is strongly recommended that Boards consult with legal counsel prior to visiting a candidate's district.
Before offering the position to the selected candidate or making any announcements, Board members may visit that candidate's current district, as appropriate, to obtain verification of his/her qualifications. 

The Board shall deliberate in closed session to affirm the selection of the candidate and shall report the selection in open session. (Government Code 54957)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 53262 and 54957, the Board may develop contract language in closed session, but the contract must be ratified in open session; see BP 2121 - Superintendent's Contract. 
The Board shall conduct these proceedings in accordance with legal and ethical obligations regarding confidentiality and equal opportunity.

As necessary, the Board may appoint an interim superintendent to manage the district during the selection process.
