## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy addresses political activities conducted by members of the Governing Board or district staff acting on behalf of the district. It does not apply to individuals acting as private citizens on their own time and at their own expense. When acting as private citizens, individuals have broad rights under the First Amendment to engage in political activities, including taking positions on electoral measures and candidates and establishing and participating in political action committees.Education Code 7055 authorizes the district to establish reasonable regulations related to employees engaging in political activity. See BP/AR 4119.25/4219.25/4319.25 - Political Activities of Employees for language implementing this statute as well as language regarding activities by employee organizations.
The Governing Board has a responsibility to actively advocate fiscal and public policy that supports the district's schools and the children in the community. The Board shall be proactive in defining the district's advocacy agenda based on the district's vision and goals and the needs of the district and community. The Board's advocacy efforts shall be conducted in accordance with legal requirements.

Ballot Measures/Candidates

No district funds, services, supplies, or equipment shall be used to urge the support or defeat of any ballot measure or candidate, including any candidate for election to the Board.  (Education Code 7054)'

CSBA NOTE: Whether an activity is an appropriate use of public funds or an impermissible campaign activity is a complicated analysis. In Vargas v. City of Salinas, the California Supreme Court created three categories of activities: (1) permissible informational activities, such as resolutions and providing objective analysis; (2) impermissible campaign activities, such as producing or distributing literature that urges a voter to act a certain way; or (3) unclear activities which do not fall into either group and must be analyzed looking at the "style, tenor, and timing" of the activity. The following two paragraphs reflect the court's analysis of permissible activities. CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel should be consulted when there is a question as to whether an activity is permissible.
The Board may discuss and study the potential effect of proposed or qualified ballot measures on the district's schools at an open and agendized Board meeting. The Board's discussion of the effect of such measures shall include an opportunity for staff and members of the public to speak on all sides of the issue. At that meeting, the Board may adopt a position or resolution in support of or in opposition to a ballot measure. The language in any resolution adopted by the Board shall not urge the public to take any action regarding the measure.

The Board's position on a ballot measure, including any resolution, shall be publicized only through normal district procedures and consistent with regular district practice for reporting Board actions. Such publicity shall be for informational purposes and shall not attempt to influence voters.

CSBA NOTE: Elections Code 9170, as added by AB 1416 (Ch. 751, Statutes of 2022), requires the ballot label or similar description of a school district measure, or other local government measure, on a county ballot to list, either as a supporter or an opponent of the measure, the associations, nonprofit organizations, businesses, or individuals, including current or former elected officials such as board members, who have signed the ballot argument or are listed in the text of the argument for or against the measure, unless the county board of supervisors elects not to list such supporters and opponents.
Individual School Board members may include their name in support of or opposition to a county, city, district, or school measure on a county ballot in accordance with Elections Code 9170.

CSBA NOTE: When it is unclear whether a campaign activity is permissible, the court will analyze the activity based on its "style, tenor and timing" to determine whether it involves an appropriate expenditure of public funds. Examples of things that a court might look for include how the material was distributed (i.e., special edition or regular publication), the language used in the publication (i.e., inflammatory or informational), and whether the distribution was consistent with regular district practice (i.e., regular circulation or special mailing). Districts should be cautious and ensure that any such informational material is an appropriate use of district funds.
The Superintendent or designee may use district resources to provide students, parents/guardians, and community members with fair and impartial information related to ballot measures, including information about the impact of ballot measures on the district.  (Education Code 7054)

In preparing or distributing such informational material, the Superintendent or designee shall analyze the material to help ensure that it is an appropriate informational activity, provides a fair analysis of the issues, and does not advocate passage or defeat of a measure or candidate.

CSBA NOTE: In Vargas v. City of Salinas, the court offered examples of activities which would be impermissible campaign activities, as reflected in the following paragraph. In addition, 2 CCR 18901.1 prohibits the use of public funds for a newsletter or "mass mailing" which expressly advocates the election or defeat of a ballot measure or candidate or, when taken in context, urges a particular result. Because violation of this regulation could result in enforcement action by the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC), districts should proceed with caution and consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel, as appropriate.
District resources, including email or computer systems, shall not be used to disseminate campaign literature. In addition, district resources shall not be used to purchase advertisements, bumper stickers, posters, or similar promotional items that advocate an election result or urge voters to take any action in support of or in opposition to a measure.

CSBA NOTE: Both the courts (Santa Barbara County Coalition Against Automobile Subsidies v. Santa Barbara County Association of Governments) and the Attorney General (88 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 46 (2005)) have provided guidance as to the appropriate use of district funds when the district is preparing to submit a bond proposal to the voters for approval. The key distinction is whether the action is taken before or after the measure has been placed on the ballot and whether the activity is directed at swaying voters. Permissible expenditures include researching the need for the measure, formulating and drafting the proposal, and conducting polling and focus groups to assess the feasibility of the measure. Impermissible activities include recruiting and organizing supporters for a campaign, raising funds for the campaign, or hiring a consultant to develop a strategy for building support for the measure.
Political activity related to district bond measures shall, in addition to the above, be subject to the following conditions:

	The Superintendent or designee may research, draft, and prepare a district bond measure or other initiative for the ballot, but shall not use district resources to influence voters or otherwise campaign for the measure.
	 
	Upon request, Board members and district administrators may appear at any time before a citizens' group to explain why the Board called for an election on a bond measure and to answer questions.  (Education Code 7054.1)
	
	If the presentation occurs during working hours, the employee representing the district shall not urge a citizens' group to vote for or against the bond measure.
	 
	The Board or any individual Board member may file a written argument for the ballot that is either for or against any school measure.  (Elections Code 9501)

Legislation

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 53060.5, the district may engage in legislative activities and lobbying, either directly or through a representative, and the cost of this activity is an appropriate use of district funds. Lobbying activities are regulated by the FPPC (2 CCR 18600-18640) and governed by the Political Reform Act (Government Code 81000-91015).
The Board's responsibility as an advocate for the district may include lobbying and outreach at the state, national, and local levels. The Board and Superintendent or designee shall work to establish and maintain ongoing relationships with elected officials, community leaders, and the media in order to communicate district positions and concerns.

The Board and Superintendent shall develop an advocacy action plan to define expectations and responsibilities. This plan may include, but is not limited to, legislative priorities, strategies for outreach to the media and community, development of key messages and talking points, and adoption of positions on specific legislation, regulations, or budget proposals.

In order to strengthen legislative advocacy efforts, the district may work with organizations and coalitions and may join associations whose representatives lobby on behalf of their members in accordance with Government Code 53060.5.

CSBA NOTE: Although the district has the authority to lobby the legislature, it cannot use district resources to urge the public to lobby the legislature on its behalf. In Miller v. Miller the court concluded that urging the public was impermissible election campaigning because the activity was directed to the public and not the legislature.
The district may provide fair and impartial information about legislative issues affecting schools and children and shall inform the community about its advocacy activities. However, informational materials about legislation shall not urge the public to lobby the legislature, Governor, or state agencies on behalf of the district.

CSBA NOTE: An appellate court held in League of Women Voters v. Countywide Criminal Justice Coordination Committee that the drafting of legislative proposals was a permissible use of public funds since it was more similar to the exercise of a local agency's governing authority than a campaign activity.
As necessary, the Board may direct the Superintendent or designee to draft legislative or regulatory proposals which serve the district's interests.

Legal Advocacy

CSBA NOTE: When an issue requires resolution in the courts rather than through legislation, it is permissible for districts to use public funds to initiate or participate in legal advocacy. Toward these ends, districts may choose to join with other districts in a group, such as CSBA's Education Legal Alliance which funds and supports litigation in cases of statewide significance to its members.
The Board recognizes that some issues are more appropriately addressed judicially rather than legislatively. When a legal issue is likely to set a state or national precedent, the district may join with other districts or parties in order to resolve the issue through litigation or other appropriate means.

Political Forums

Forums on political issues may be held in district facilities as long as the forum is made available to all sides of the issue on an equitable basis.  (Education Code 7058)

Because violation of this regulation could result in enforcement action by the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC), districts should proceed with caution and consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel, as appropriate.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="EOTcNQ4" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22EOTcNQ4%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22ANg302%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1694469309%2C%22text%22%3A%22In%20Vargas%20v.%20City%20of%20Salinas%2C%20the%20court%20offered%20examples%20of%20activities%20which%20would%20be%20impermissible%20campaign%20activities%2C%20as%20reflected%20in%20the%20following%20paragraph.%20In%20addition%2C%202%20CCR%2018901.1%20prohibits%20the%20use%20of%20public%20funds%20for%20a%20newsletter%20or%20%5C%22mass%20mailing%5C%22%20which%20expressly%20advocates%20the%20election%20or%20defeat%20of%20a%20ballot%20measure%20or%20candidate%20or%2C%20when%20taken%20in%20context%2C%20urges%20a%20particular%20result.%20Because%20violation%20of%20this%20regulation%20could%20result%20in%20enforcement%20action%20by%20the%20Fair%20Political%20Practices%20Commission%20%28FPPC%29%2C%20districts%20should%20proceed%20with%20caution%20and%20consult%20with%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel%2C%20as%20appropriate.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-EOTcNQ4" title="CSBA NOTE: In Vargas v.

Santa Barbara County Association of Governments) and the Attorney General (88 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 46 (2005)) have provided guidance as to the appropriate use of district funds when the district is preparing to submit a bond proposal to the voters for approval. The key distinction is whether the action is taken before or after the measure has been placed on the ballot and whether the activity is directed at swaying voters. Permissible expenditures include researching the need for the measure, formulating and drafting the proposal, and conducting polling and focus groups to assess the feasibility of the measure. Impermissible activities include recruiting and organizing supporters for a campaign, raising funds for the campaign, or hiring a consultant to develop a strategy for building support for the measure.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="EOTcNQ5" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22EOTcNQ5%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22yNA303%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1694469322%2C%22text%22%3A%22Both%20the%20courts%20%28Santa%20Barbara%20County%20Coalition%20Against%20Automobile%20Subsidies%20v.%20Santa%20Barbara%20County%20Association%20of%20Governments%29%20and%20the%20Attorney%20General%20%2888%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%2046%20%282005%29%29%20have%20provided%20guidance%20as%20to%20the%20appropriate%20use%20of%20district%20funds%20when%20the%20district%20is%20preparing%20to%20submit%20a%20bond%20proposal%20to%20the%20voters%20for%20approval.%20The%20key%20distinction%20is%20whether%20the%20action%20is%20taken%20before%20or%20after%20the%20measure%20has%20been%20placed%20on%20the%20ballot%20and%20whether%20the%20activity%20is%20directed%20at%20swaying%20voters.%20Permissible%20expenditures%20include%20researching%20the%20need%20for%20the%20measure%2C%20formulating%20and%20drafting%20the%20proposal%2C%20and%20conducting%20polling%20and%20focus%20groups%20to%20assess%20the%20feasibility%20of%20the%20measure.%20Impermissible%20activities%20include%20recruiting%20and%20organizing%20supporters%20for%20a%20campaign%2C%20raising%20funds%20for%20the%20campaign%2C%20or%20hiring%20a%20consultant%20to%20develop%20a%20strategy%20for%20building%20support%20for%20the%20measure.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-EOTcNQ5" title="CSBA NOTE: Both the courts (Santa Barbara County C..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
