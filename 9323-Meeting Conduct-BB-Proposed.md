## Policy Content

Meeting Procedures

All Board of Education meetings shall begin on time and shall be guided by an agenda prepared in accordance with Board bylaws and posted and distributed in accordance with the Ralph M. Brown Act (open meeting requirements) and other applicable laws.

The Board president shall conduct Board meetings in accordance with Board bylaws and procedures that enable the Board to efficiently consider issues and carry out the will of the majority.

The Board believes that late night meetings deter public participation, can affect the Board's decision-making ability, and can be a burden to staff. Regular Board meetings shall be adjourned by 10:30 p.m. unless extended to a specific time determined by a majority of the Board. The meeting shall be extended no more than once and, if necessary, may subsequently be adjourned to a later date.

Quorum and Abstentions

The Board shall act by majority vote of all of the membership constituting the Board. (Education Code 35164)

The Board believes that when no conflict of interest requires abstention, its members have a duty to vote on issues before them.  When a member abstains, the abstention shall not be counted for purposes of determining whether a majority of the membership of the Board has taken action.

Provided the Board typically has seven members and there are no more than two vacancies on the Board, the vacant position(s) shall not be counted for purposes of determining how many members of the Board constitute a majority. In addition, whenever any provisions of the Education Code require unanimous action of all or a specific number of the members, the vacant position(s) shall not be counted for purposes of determining the total membership constituting the Board.  (Education Code 35165)

Public Participation

Members of the public are encouraged to attend Board meetings and to address the Board concerning any item on the agenda or within the Board's jurisdiction. So as not to inhibit public participation, persons attending Board meetings shall not be requested to sign in, complete a questionnaire, or otherwise provide their name or other information as a condition of attending the meeting, except that if the meeting is conducted using remote public participation or with a Board member attending remotely pursuant to Government Code 54953, a member of the public desiring to provide comment through the use of a third party internet website or online platform may be required to register as required by the third party provider.

Formal written correspondence to the Board of Education shall be acknowledged if received by the Board, or in the Superintendent's Office, by 2:00 p.m. the day before the meeting.  Formal written correspondence received after the cutoff time will be acknowledged at the following meeting.  Electronic communications received via the Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District (LVJUSD) website by accessing the "Formal Written Correspondence to the Board of Education" link, with all fields completed, shall be treated as formal written correspondence and will be published in the electronic packet posted to the District website.

In order to conduct District business in an orderly and efficient manner, the Board requires that public presentations to the Board comply with the following procedures:

	The Board shall give members of the public an opportunity to address the Board on any item of interest to the public that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board, either before or during the Board's consideration of the item.  (Education Code 35145.5; Government Code 54954.3)
	 
	At a time so designated on the agenda at a regular meeting, members of the public may bring before the Board matters that are not listed on the agenda. The Board shall take no action or discussion on any item not appearing on the posted agenda, except as authorized by law.  (Education Code 35145.5; Government Code 54954.2)
	 
	Without taking action, Board members or District staff members may briefly respond to statements made or questions posed by the public about items not appearing on the agenda. Additionally, on their own initiative or in response to questions posed by the public, Board members or staff members may ask a question for clarification, make a brief announcement, or make a brief report on their own activities.  (Government Code 54954.2)
	
	Furthermore, the Board or a Board member may provide a reference to staff or other resources for factual information, ask staff to report back to the Board at a subsequent meeting concerning any matter, or take action directing staff to place a matter of business on a future agenda.  (Government Code 54954.2)
	 
	The Board need not allow the public to speak on any item that has already been considered by a committee composed exclusively of Board members at a public meeting where the public had the opportunity to address the committee on that item. However, if the Board determines that the item has been substantially changed since the committee heard the item, the Board shall provide an opportunity for the public to speak.  (Government Code 54954.3)
	 
	A person wishing to be heard by the Board shall first be recognized by the president and shall then proceed to comment as briefly as the subject permits.
	
	In general, individual speakers will be allowed three minutes to address the Board on each agenda or non-agenda item. In the event of a large number of speakers, audience communication for both non-agenda and agenda items will be modified in the following way:
	
	1-10 comment cards: each speaker will be allotted 3 minutes
	
	11 -20 comment cards: each speaker will be allotted 2 minutes
	
	21 or more comment cards: each speaker will be allotted 1 minute
	
	The president may also ask members of the public with the same viewpoint to select a few individuals to address the Board on behalf of that viewpoint.
	
	In order to ensure that non-English speakers receive the same opportunity to directly address the Board, any member of the public who utilizes a translator shall be provided at least twice the allotted time to address the Board, unless simultaneous translation equipment is used to allow the Board to hear the translated public testimony simultaneously.  (Government Code 54954.3)
	 
	The Board president may rule on the appropriateness of a topic, subject to the following conditions:
	 
	
		If a topic would be suitably addressed at a later time, the Board president may indicate the time and place when it should be presented.
		 
		The Board shall not prohibit public criticism of its policies, procedures, programs, services, acts, or omissions.  (Government Code 54954.3)
		 
		The Board shall not prohibit public criticism of District employees. However, whenever a member of the public initiates specific complaints or charges against an individual employee, the Board president shall inform the complainant of the appropriate complaint procedure.
		 
	
	
	The Board president shall not permit actual disruption of Board meetings. Actual disruption by an individual or group or any conduct or statements that threaten the safety of any person(s) at the meeting shall be grounds for the president to terminate the privilege of addressing the Board and remove the individual from the meeting.
	
	The Board President or designee may remove an individual for actually disrupting the meeting. Prior to removal, the individual shall be warned that their behavior is disrupting the meeting and that failure to cease the disruptive behavior may result in removal. If, after being warned, the individual does not promptly cease the disruptive behavior, the Board president, or designee, may then remove the individual from the meeting.  (Government Code 54957.95)
	
	When an individual's behavior constitutes the use of force or a true threat of force, the individual shall be removed from a Board meeting without a warning.  (Government Code 54957.95)
	
	Disrupting means engaging in behavior during a Board meeting that actually disrupts, disturbs, impedes, or renders infeasible the orderly conduct of the meeting and includes, but is not limited to, a failure to comply with reasonable and lawful regulations adopted by a legislative body pursuant to Section 54954.3 or any other law, or engaging in behavior that constitutes use of force or a true threat of force.  (Government Code 54957.95)
	
	True threat of force means a threat that has sufficient indicia of intent and seriousness, that a reasonable observer would perceive it to be an actual threat to use force by the person making the threat.  (Government Code 54957.95)
	
	Additionally, the Board may order the room cleared if necessary. In this case, members of the media not participating in the disturbance shall be allowed to remain, and individuals not participating in such disturbances may be allowed to remain at the discretion of the Board. When the room is ordered cleared due to a disturbance, further Board proceedings shall concern only matters appearing on the agenda.  (Government Code 54957.9)
	
	When disruptive conduct occurs, the Board may decide to recess the meeting to help restore order, or if removing the disruptive individual(s) or clearing the room is infeasible, move the meeting to another location. The Board may direct the Superintendent or designee to contact local law enforcement as necessary.

Recording by the Public

Members of the public may record an open Board meeting using an audio or video recorder, still or motion picture camera, cell phone, or other device, provided that the noise, illumination, or obstruction of view does not persistently disrupt the meeting. The Superintendent or designee may designate locations from which members of the public may make such recordings without causing a distraction.

If the Board finds that noise, illumination, or obstruction of view related to these activities would persistently disrupt the proceedings, these activities shall be discontinued or restricted as determined by the Board.  (Government Code 54953.5, 54953.6)
