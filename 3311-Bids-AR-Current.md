## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54202, districts are mandated to establish bidding procedures governing the purchase of equipment and supplies. The following administrative regulation and accompanying Board policy reflect the competitive bidding procedures applicable to these purchases, as well as contracts pursuant to Public Contract Code 20111 for certain services, public works projects, and repairs and maintenance, when the contract exceeds the amount specified in law.An alternative procedure for public works projects is provided pursuant to the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (UPCCAA) (Public Contract Code 22000-22045). Pursuant to Public Contract Code 22032, as amended by AB 2192 (Ch. 953, Statutes of 2024), projects of $75,000 or less may be performed by district employees and public projects of $220,000 or less may be contracted using a more informal bidding process. For more information regarding UPCCAA, see BP/AR 3311.1 - Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Procedures. Districts that have adopted the UPCCAA procedures should modify the following regulation to delete or revise conflicting provisions related to contracts for public works. Also see AR 3311.2 - Lease-Leaseback Contracts, AR 3311.3 - Design-Build Contracts, and AR 3311.4 - Procurement of Technological Equipment for procedures applicable to those contracts.
Advertised/Competitive Bids

The district shall advertise for any of the following:  (Public Contract Code 20111)

	A public project contract that involves an expenditure of $15,000 or more, including a contract for construction, reconstruction, erection, alteration, renovation, improvement, painting, repainting, demolition, or repair work involving a district owned, leased, or operated facility
	
	CSBA NOTE: For the contracts specified in Item #2a-c below, Public Contract Code 20111 requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) to annually establish a bid limit that reflects U.S. Department of Commerce data. The following paragraph allows the amount to escalate automatically once the SPI has made the annual determination. For 2025, the bid limit is $114,800.
	A contract that exceeds the amount specified in law, as annually adjusted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for any of the following:
	 
	
		The purchase of equipment, materials, or supplies to be furnished, sold, or leased to the district
		 
		Services, not including construction services or special services and advice in accounting, financial, legal, or administrative matters
		 
		Repairs that are not a public project, including maintenance
	
	

Maintenance means routine, recurring, and usual work for preserving, protecting, and keeping a district facility operating in a safe, efficient, and continually usable condition for the intended purpose for which it was designed, improved, constructed, altered, or repaired. Maintenance includes, but is not limited to, carpentry, electrical, plumbing, glazing, and other craft work designed to preserve the facility, as well as repairs, cleaning, and other operations on machinery and other permanently attached equipment. Maintenance also includes landscape maintenance, including mowing, watering, trimming, pruning, planting, replacement of plants, and servicing of irrigation and sprinkler systems. Maintenance does not include painting, repainting, or decorating, other than minor repainting; janitorial or custodial services; and protection provided by security forces.  (Public Contract Code 20115, 22002)

Instructions and Procedures for Advertised Bids

The Superintendent or designee shall call for bids by placing a notice at least once a week for two weeks in a local newspaper of general circulation published in the district, or if no such newspaper exists, then in some newspaper of general circulation that is circulated in the county. Additionally, the Superintendent or designee may post the notice on the district's website or through an electronic portal. The notice shall state the work to be done or materials or supplies to be furnished and the time and place and website where bids will be opened.  (Public Contract Code 20112)

The notice shall contain the time, date, and location of any mandatory prebid conference, site visit, or meeting and details regarding when and where project documents, including the final plan and specifications, are available. Any such mandatory visit or meeting shall occur not less than five calendar days after the publication of the initial notice.  (Public Contract Code 6610)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Public Contract Code 2600 all bid documents and construction contracts, when applicable, must contain a notice that the project is subject to the skilled and trained workforce requirements specified in Public Contract Code 2600-2603. Skilled and trained workforce requirements are required for lease-leaseback projects, design-build, and alternative design-build projects. Skilled and trained workforce is optional for all other construction delivery methods. See AR 3311.2 Lease-Leaseback Contracts and AR 3311.3 -- Design-Build Contracts for specific bidding requirements.
For lease-leaseback, design-build, and alternative design-build projects, the notice shall additionally specify that the project is subject to skilled and trained workforce requirements.  (Education Code 17250.25, 17250.62, 17407.5; Public Contract Code 2600, 6610)

Bid instructions and specifications shall include the following requirements and information:

	All bidders shall certify in writing the minimum, if not exact, percentage of post-consumer materials in products, materials, goods, or supplies offered or sold  (Public Contract Code 22152)
	 
	All bids for construction work shall be presented under sealed cover  (Public Contract Code 20111)
	
	The district may accept a bid that has been submitted electronically or on paper.  (Public Contract Code 20111, 20112)
	
	The bid shall be accompanied by a form of bidder's security, including either cash, a cashier's check payable to the district, a certified check made payable to the district, or a bidder's bond executed by an admitted surety insurer and made payable to the district. The security of unsuccessful bidders shall be returned in a reasonable period of time, but in no event later than 60 days after the bid is awarded.  (Public Contract Code 20111, 20112)
	 
	When a standardized proposal form is provided by the district, bids not presented on the standard form shall be disregarded  (Public Contract Code 20111.5)
	 
	Bids shall not be accepted after the advertised bid opening time, regardless of whether the bids are actually opened at that time  (Public Contract Code 20112)
	 
	When two or more identical lowest or highest bids are received, the Governing Board may determine by lot which bid shall be accepted  (Public Contract Code 20117)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Public Contract Code 20103.8 specifies that, in those cases when the bid includes items that may be added to or deducted from the scope of the work in the contract, the bid solicitation must specify the method to be used to determine the lowest bid, as detailed below. It is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel, as appropriate, with questions regarding the applicability of this law.
	If the district requires that the bid includes prices for items that may be added to or deducted from the scope of work in the contract, the bid solicitation shall specify which one of the following methods will be used to determine the lowest bid  (Public Contract Code 20103.8)
	
	In the absence of such a specification, only the method provided in Item #6a below shall be used.  (Public Contract Code 20103.8)
	 
	
		The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract without consideration of the prices on the additive or deductive items
		 
		The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that were specifically identified in the bid solicitation as being used for the purpose of determining the lowest bid price
		 
		The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that, when taken in order from a specifically identified list of those items in the solicitation, and added to or subtracted from the base contract, are less than or equal to a funding amount publicly disclosed by the district before the first bid is opened  (Public Contract Code 20103.8)
		
		The lowest bid shall be determined in a manner that prevents any information that would identify any of the bidders or proposed subcontractors or suppliers from being revealed to the district before the ranking of all bidders from lowest to highest has been determined.  (Public Contract Code 20103.8)
		
		CSBA NOTE: For a bid to be successful, it must conform to bid specifications (i.e., it must be "responsive") and the bidder must be determined to be able to perform the work (i.e., the bidder must be "responsible" as defined in Public Contract Code 1103). There is no right to a due process hearing when the district has merely found the bid to be nonresponsive. It is recommended that districts provide clear and comprehensive bid specifications to bidders and that a determination on the "nonresponsiveness" of a bid be based only on the documents submitted.When rejecting the lowest responsive bid on the basis that the bidder is nonresponsible, the district is required to inform the bidder of the evidence used when making the determination and afford the bidder a hearing with the right to present evidence that the bidder is responsible.
	
	
	In determining the lowest bid, the district shall consider only responsive bids that conform to bid specifications and are submitted by responsible bidders who have demonstrated trustworthiness, quality, fitness, capacity, and experience to satisfactorily perform the public works contract
	 
	
		When a bid is determined to be nonresponsive, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the bidder and give the bidder an opportunity to respond to the determination
		 
		When the lowest bidder is determined to be nonresponsible, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the bidder of the right to present evidence of the bidder's responsibility at a hearing before the Board
		 
	
	
	After being opened, all submitted bids become public records pursuant to Government Code 7920.530 and shall be made available for public review pursuant to law, Board policy, and administrative regulation

Prequalification Procedure

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional. Pursuant to Public Contract Code 20111.6, a district with average daily attendance (ADA) of 2,500 or greater is required to prequalify all general contractors and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors for any public project of $1,000,000 or more, when the project uses state general funds, School Facilities Program funds (Education Code 17070.10-17079.30), or uses or is reimbursed from future state school bonds. A model prequalification questionnaire is available on the Department of Industrial Relations' website.Additionally, pursuant to Public Contract Code 20111.5, districts are permitted, but not required, to establish prequalification procedures for other contracts which, by law, require competitive bidding.
When required by law or the Board, the Superintendent or designee shall establish a uniform system for rating bidders on the basis of completed questionnaires and financial statements in order to determine the size of contracts on which each bidder is qualified to bid. For this purpose, the Superintendent or designee shall furnish prospective bidders a standardized prequalification questionnaire and financial record which, when completed, shall indicate a bidder's statement of financial ability and experience in performing public works. The bidder's information shall be verified under oath in the manner in which civil law pleadings are verified. The questionnaires and financial statements shall not be public records and shall not be open to public inspection.  (Code of Civil Procedure 446; Public Contract Code 20111.5, 20111.6)

When any public project involves an expenditure of $1,000,000 or more and is funded or reimbursed wholly or partly by state general funds, the School Facilities Program funds, or other future state school bond, the district shall prequalify prospective bidders either quarterly or annually. The prequalification shall be valid for one year and the following requirements shall apply:  (Public Contract Code 20111.6)

	Prospective bidders, including, but not limited to, prime, general engineering, and general building contractors and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors, as defined in Public Contract Code 4113 or Business and Professions Code 7056 or 7057, as applicable, shall submit a standardized questionnaire and financial statement 10 or more business days, as determined by the district, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids
	 
	Prospective bidders shall be prequalified by the district five or more business days, as determined by the district, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids

If the project includes electrical, mechanical, or plumbing components that will be performed by electrical, mechanical, or plumbing contractors, the Superintendent or designee shall make available to all bidders a list of prequalified general contractors and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors five or more business days, as determined by the district, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids.  (Public Contract Code 20111.6)

For all other contracts requiring competitive bidding, the district may establish a procedure for prequalifying bidders on a quarterly basis and may authorize that prequalification be considered valid for up to one calendar year following the date of the initial prequalification. Prospective bidders for such contracts shall submit the questionnaire and financial statement at least five days before the date fixed for public opening of sealed bids and shall be prequalified by the district at least one day before the fixed bid-opening date.  (Public Contract Code 20111.5)

Limitation on Use of Sole Sourcing

CSBA NOTE: "Sole sourcing" is the practice by which one brand name product is specified, although comparable, competitive products are available. Public Contract Code 3400 allows sole sourcing in limited circumstances and requires that the specification of the designated product be followed by the words "or equal," so that bidders for such a contract are able to base their bids on the use of other products of equal functionality that may result in cost savings for the district. The following section is optional.
In any contract for the construction, alteration, or repair of school facilities, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the bid specification:  (Public Contract Code 3400)

	Does not directly or indirectly limit bidding to any one specific concern
	 
	Does not call for a designated material, product, thing, or service by a specific brand or trade name, unless the specification is followed by the words "or equal," so that bidders may furnish any equal material, product, thing, or service
	
	In any such case, the bid specification shall provide a time period, before and/or after the award of the contract, for the contractor to submit data substantiating the request for substituting the designated material, product, thing, or service. If no such time period is specified, the contractor may submit the data within 35 days after the award of the contract.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts with ADA of more than 2,500. For the repair or replacement of the roof of a public facility, a material must meet the requirements specified below to be considered "equal" pursuant to Public Contract Code 3000-3010.
When the bid is for a roof project, a material, product, thing, or service is considered "equal" to that designated if it is equal in quality, durability, design, and appearance; will perform the intended function equally well; and conforms substantially to the detailed requirements in the bid specification.  (Public Contract Code 3002)

However, the Superintendent or designee may designate a specific material, product, thing, or service by brand or trade name, also known as sole sourcing, if the Board has made a finding, described in the invitation for bids or request for proposals (RFP), that a particular material, product, thing, or service is designated for any of the following purposes:  (Public Contract Code 3400)

	To conduct a field test or experiment to determine its suitability for future use
	 
	To match others in use on a particular public improvement that has been completed or is in the course of completion
	 
	To obtain a necessary item that is only available from one source
	 
	To respond to the Board's declaration of an emergency, so long as the declaration has been approved by four-fifths of the Board when issuing the invitation for bid or RFP

Bids Not Required

CSBA NOTE: Districts may be exempt from certain bidding requirements; see "Bids Not Required" in the accompanying Board policy. The following optional paragraphs are additional instances that do not require competitive bidding.
Without taking estimates or advertising for bids, supplementary textbooks, library books, educational films, audiovisual materials, test materials, workbooks, instructional computer software packages, or periodicals may be purchased in any amount.  (Public Contract Code 20118.3)

Perishable foodstuffs and seasonal commodities needed in the operations of cafeterias may be purchased through bid or on the open market.  (Education Code 38083)

Bids shall not be required for day labor under circumstances specified in Public Contract Code 20114. Day labor shall include the use of maintenance personnel employed on a permanent or temporary basis.  (Public Contract Code 20114)

The district may purchase any surplus property from the federal government or any of its agencies in any quantity needed for the operation of its schools without taking estimates or advertising for bids.  (Education Code 17602)

When any public project involves an expenditure of $1,000,000 or more and is funded or reimbursed wholly or partly by state general funds, the School Facilities Program funds, or other future state school bond, the district shall prequalify prospective bidders either quarterly or annually.

	<li>Prospective bidders shall be prequalified by the district five or more business days, as determined by the district, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids</li>

If the project includes electrical, mechanical, or plumbing components that will be performed by electrical, mechanical, or plumbing contractors, the Superintendent or designee shall make available to all bidders a list of prequalified general contractors and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors five or more business days, as determined by the district, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids.&nbsp; (Public Contract Code 20111.6)<br>
<br>
For all other contracts requiring competitive bidding, the district may establish a procedure for prequalifying bidders on a quarterly basis and may authorize that prequalification be considered valid for up to one calendar year following the date of the initial prequalification. Prospective bidders for such contracts shall submit the questionnaire and financial statement at least five days before the date fixed for public opening of sealed bids and shall be prequalified by the district at least one day before the fixed bid-opening date.&nbsp; (Public Contract Code 20111.5)<br>
