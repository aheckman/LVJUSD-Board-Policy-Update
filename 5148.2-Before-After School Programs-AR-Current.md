## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation is mandated for use by districts providing expanded learning opportunities beyond the regular school day, including before-school, after-school, summer, vacation, and/or intersessional programs, and should be revised to reflect the program(s) offered by the district. The district should revise the following administrative regulation to reflect the expanded learning opportunity programs, including before and/or after school program(s), it offers and the grade levels at which the programs are offered. In addition to the program requirements described below, before-school and after-school programs may be subject to other district policies such as BP/AR 5148 - Child Care and Development, AR 3514.2 - Integrated Pest Management, and BP/AR 3550 - Food Service/Child Nutrition Program. It is recommended that the district consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel with questions regarding the applicability of other laws to the district's programs.The California Department of Education (CDE) monitors, through its Federal Program Monitoring process, Expanded Learning Division grants including before-school, after-school, summer/supplemental, equitable access, After School Education and Safety Program (ASES) transportation, and Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO), the requirements of which are reflected throughout this administrative regulation.
Definitions

Expanded learning opportunities means before school, after school, summer, vacation, and/or intersession learning programs that focus on developing the academic, social, emotional, and physical needs and interests of students through hands-on, engaging learning experiences. Expanded learning opportunities does not mean an extension of instructional time, but rather, opportunities to engage students in enrichment, play, nutrition, and other developmentally appropriate activities.  (Education Code 8482.1, 46120)

Intersession program means an expanded learning program offered by a district on non-school days, including, but not limited to, summer school.  (Education Code 48853.5)

Offer access, with regard to an Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO), means to recruit, advertise, publicize, or solicit through culturally and linguistically effective and appropriate communication channels.  (Education Code 46120)

Provide access, with regard to an ELO, means to enroll a student in an ELO. If a parent/guardian has a signed an ELO registration form and that form is on file, the student shall be considered enrolled in the ELO.  (Education Code 46120)

Unduplicated student means a student enrolled in a district who is either classified as an English learner, eligible for a free or reduced-price meal, or is a foster youth.  (Education Code 42238.02, 46120)

Grades Transitional Kindergarten-9

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts providing before-school and/or after-school programs funded by the state ASES (Education Code 8482-8484.65), the federal 21st Century Community Learning Center Program (21st CCLC) (Education Code 8484.7-8484.9; 20 USC 7171-7176), or the state ELO (Education Code 46120).ASES and 21st CCLC programs serve students who are in grades kindergarten-9 in an elementary, middle, or junior high school. ELOs serve students who are in grades Transitional Kindergarten (TK)-6. CDE's webpage, "Expanded Learning Opportunities Program FAQs," states that once the minimum requirements providing an ELO are met, districts may provide access to additional grade spans in elementary, middle, and secondary students, and/or provide expanded hours of programming.
The district's After School Education and Safety Program (ASES) or 21st Century Community Learning Center Program (21st CCLC) shall serve students in any of grades Transitional Kindergarten (TK)-9 as the district may determine based on local needs.  (Education Code 8482.3, 8484.7, 8484.75, 8484.8)

The district's 21st CCLC program shall primarily serve students in Title I schoolwide programs.  (Education Code 8484.8; 20 USC 7173)

The district's ELO shall serve students in grades TK-6.  (Education Code 46120)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraphs reflect the extent to which before/after school programs, including ASES, 21st CCLC and ELO, require collaborative planning. Districts may revise the following paragraphs to reflect programs offered by the district.
The district's programs shall be planned through a collaborative process that includes parents/guardians, students, representatives of participating schools, governmental agencies, including city and county parks and recreation departments, local law enforcement, community organizations, and the private sector. As appropriate, the Superintendent or designee may include other stakeholders in such collaborative process. (Education Code 8422, 8482.5, 8483.3, 8484.75, 46120)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 46120 provides for ELO and allocates funding to districts under a formula based on a district's percentage of unduplicated students and average daily attendance. Districts with a prior fiscal year local control funding formula (LCFF) unduplicated pupil percentage (UPP) of less than 75 percent are required to offer access to an ELO to all unduplicated students in grades TK-6 and ensure that access is provided to any unduplicated student whose parent/guardian requests placement in an ELO. Districts are required to prioritize services at school sites in the lowest income communities, as determined by prior year percentages of students eligible for free and reduced-price meals, while maximizing the number of schools and neighborhoods with ELOs across their attendance area.The following paragraph is for districts that receive ELO funds and should be deleted by districts that do not receive such funds. CDE's webpage, "Expanded Learning Opportunities Program FAQs," clarifies that districts that serve classroom-based instructional programs in grades TK-6, not including a charter school established pursuant to Education Code 47605.5, are eligible for ELO funding, and that districts cannot opt-out of the ELO funding.
The district shall offer access to ELO to all unduplicated students in grades TK-6 and provide access to such program to at least 50 percent of enrolled unduplicated students.  (Education Code 46120)

CSBA NOTE: Option 1 below is for use by districts with a prior fiscal year LCFF UPP of at least 75 percent. Option 2 is for districts with a prior fiscal year LCFF UPP of less than 75 percent.
OPTION 1:  (For districts with a prior fiscal year local control funding formula unduplicated pupil percentage of at least 75 percent)

The district shall offer access to ELO to all classroom-based students in grades TK-6. The district shall provide access to any student whose parent/guardian requests placement in an ELO.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (For districts with a prior fiscal year local control funding formula unduplicated pupil percentage of less than 75 percent)

The district shall offer access to ELO to all classroom-based unduplicated students in grades TK-6. The district shall provide access to any unduplicated student whose parent/guardian requests placement in an ELO.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46120, a district is required to provide transportation to any student who attends a school that is not operating an ELO to attend at a location that is providing an ELO, and to return to the original location or another location that is established by the district. CDE's, "Expanded Learning Opportunities Program FAQs," further states that transportation should not be a barrier to ELO participation and that the ELO should be created as universally available and accessible to students.
The district shall provide transportation to any student who attends a school that is not operating an ELO so that the student may attend at a location that is providing an ELO and return to the original location or another location that is established by the district.  (Education Code 46120)

CSBA NOTE: The California Prekindergarten Planning and Implementation Grant Program, established pursuant to Education Code 8322, provides for a state early learning initiative with the goal of expanding access to classroom-based prekindergarten programs. See BP 6170.1 - Transitional Kindergarten.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the plan to provide access to full-day learning programs the year before kindergarten addresses the needs of children and their families as specified in Board Policy 6170.1 - Transitional Kindergarten.  (Education Code 8322)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 8484.75, programs funded through 21st CCLC are generally subject to the same program requirements applicable to ASES, with the exception of specified provisions primarily related to allocation of funds, collaboration, and data collection. In contrast, ELOs are explicitly subject to some, but not all, of the ASES program requirements pursuant to Education Code 46120. However, CDE's webpage, "Expanded Learning Opportunities FAQs," emphasizes that districts are expected to uniformly apply the stricter ASES requirements to all programs since ASES, 21st CCLC, and ELO should be considered a single, comprehensive program. As such, the following section reflects the expectation that ELOs will comply with all the requirements for ASES and 21st CCLC programs.The following section applies to ASES, 21st CCLC, and ELO programs, except where otherwise noted, and should be revised to reflect the program(s) offered by the district.
The district's ASES, 21st CCLC, and ELO program(s) shall be operated in accordance with the following:

	Program Elements
	 
	
		The program shall include an educational and literacy element in which tutoring or homework assistance is provided in language arts, mathematics, history and social science, computer training, and/or science  (Education Code 8482.3, 8484.75, 46120)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Education Code 8482.3 requires that the program include an educational enrichment component, which may include physical fitness. Pursuant to Education Code 8483.55 and 8484.8, CDE has developed voluntary, "California After School Physical Activity Guidelines," which are available on its website.
		The program shall include an educational enrichment element which may include, but is not limited to, fine arts, career technical education, recreation, technology, physical fitness, and prevention activities  (Education Code 8482.3, 8484.75, 46120)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 8482.3, districts are required to offer a nutritional snack, meal, or both that conform to applicable state or federal nutrition standards. Reimbursement for providing snacks is available through the National School Lunch Program and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) for participating districts. Pursuant to the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (42 USC 1766-1766a), after-school programs participating in the at-risk after-school care component of the CACFP may be reimbursed for serving full meals. Further information is available on CDE's and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's websites.
	
	
	Nutrition
	 
	
		Snacks or meals made available in the program shall conform to nutrition standards specified in Education Code 49430-49434 or 42 USC 1766 as applicable  (Education Code 8482.3, 8484.75, 46120; 42 USC 1766-1766a; 7 CFR 226.17)
		 
		The district's before-school program shall offer a breakfast meal as described in Education Code 49553 for all program participants  (Education Code 8483.1, 8484.75)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Education Code 8482.3 provides that a program may be offered at one or multiple school sites. Program applications and U.S. Department of Education's (USDOE) September 2024 nonregulatory guidance, "Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program," state that programs may be located off campus as long as the facility is as available and accessible to students as if it were located at a school. Regardless of whether the program takes place in a school building or other facility, an applicant must (1) assure that it will provide a safe and easily accessible facility and (2) describe how it will address the transportation needs of participating students, including the needs of highly mobile students such as students experiencing homelessness, migratory students, or foster youth.
	
	
	Location of Program
	 
	
		The program may be offered at one or multiple school sites and/or at an easily available and accessible off-campus facility  (Education Code 8482.3, 8484.75
		 
		When there is a significant barrier to student participation in either the before-school or after-school component of a program at the school of attendance, the Superintendent or designee may, with the approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, provide services at another school site
		
		Such transfer of services shall occur only if the school to which the program will be transferred agrees to receive students from the transferring school and has an existing grant of the same type as the transferring school, or does not have a 10-percent lower percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals than the transferring school. A significant barrier includes any of the following:  (Education Code 8482.8, 8484.75)
		 
		
			Fewer than 20 students participating in the program component
			 
			Extreme transportation constraints, including, but not limited to, desegregation busing, busing for magnet or open enrollment schools, or student dependence on public transportation
			 
			A reduction in the program grant of an existing school due to its merging into a new school opened by the district or the splitting of its students with a new school
			
			In such cases, the district shall arrange for safe, supervised transportation between school sites; ensure communication among staff in the regular school program, staff in the before-school or after-school program, and parents/guardians; and ensure alignment of the educational and literacy elements with the regular school program of participating students.  (Education Code 8482.8, 8484.75)
			 
		
		
	
	
	Staffing
	 
	
		All staff members who directly supervise students shall, at a minimum, meet the qualifications for an instructional aide  (Education Code 8483.4, 8484.75, 45330, 45344, 45344.5)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 8483.4, program staff and volunteers are required to meet health screening and fingerprint clearance requirements.Education Code 49024 provides that the requirement to obtain an Activity Supervisor Clearance Certificate prior to beginning a paid or volunteer position is satisfied by clearing a Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal background check.
		All program staff and volunteers shall be subject to the health screening and fingerprint clearance requirements in law and Board policy  (Education Code 8483.4, 8484.75
		 
		The student-to-staff ratio shall be no more than 20 to 1, except that programs serving TK or kindergarten students shall maintain a student-to-staff member ratio of no more than 10 to 1  (Education Code 8483.4,  8484.75, 46120)
		 
	
	
	Hours of Operation
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46120, ELOs must provide in-person before or after school expanded learning opportunities offered on school days that, when added to daily instructional minutes, recess, and meals, meet certain hourly requirements, as specified. Item #5(a) and 5(b) below do not apply to ELOs offered pursuant to Education Code 46120.
	
		A before-school program shall not operate for less than one and one-half hours per regular school day  (Education Code 8483.1, 8484.75)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 8483, ASES programs that operate at a school site located in an area that has a population density of less than 11 persons per square mile may end operating hours not earlier than 5 p.m. The following paragraph can be revised to reflect district programs.
		An after-school program shall begin immediately upon the conclusion of the regular school day and shall operate a minimum of 15 hours per week and at least until 6 p.m. on every regular school day  (Education Code 8483, 8484.75)
		 
		An ELO shall provide in-person before or after school expanded learning opportunities that, when added to daily instructional minutes, recess, and meals, shall not be less than nine hours of combined instructional time, recess, meals, and expanded learning opportunities per instructional day  (Education Code 46120)
		 
	
	
	Admissions
	 
	
		Every student attending a school operating a program is eligible to participate in the program, subject to program capacity  (Education Code 8482.6, 8484.75)
		 
		If the number of students wishing to participate in the program exceeds program capacity, students shall be selected for enrollment based on the following guidelines:
		
		CSBA NOTE: A district that operates an intersession program is required to grant priority access to a foster youth pursuant to Education Code 48853.5, as amended by AB 723 (Ch. 812, Statutes of 2023), and to a student experiencing homelessness, pursuant to Education Code 48850, as amended by AB 373 (Ch. 327, Statutes of 2023). If any such student will be moving during an intersession period, the student's educational rights holder, or in the case of an American Indian student, Indian custodian, is authorized to determine which school the student attends for the intersession period.
		
			First priority for enrollment shall be given to students who are identified as homeless youth, as defined by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 USC 11434a), at the time they apply for enrollment or at any time during the school year, to students who are identified by the program as being in foster care, and to students who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals  (Education Code 8483, 8483.1, 8484.75)
			
			The district is not required to disenroll a current student in order to secure the enrollment of a student who has priority for enrollment.  (Education Code 8483, 8483.1)
			
			The district shall inform the parent/guardian of a student experiencing homelessness or foster youth, or student eligible for free or reduced price meals, of the right of the child to receive priority enrollment and how to request priority enrollment.  (Education Code 8483, 8484.75)
			
			If a student experiencing homelessness or a foster youth will be moving during an intersession period, the student's educational rights holder, or in the case of an American Indian Student, Indian custodian, may determine which school the student attends for the intersession period.  (Education Code 48850, 48853.5)
			
			CSBA NOTE: Item #2 below is for use by districts that maintain middle or junior high schools.
			Second priority for enrollment of middle or junior high school students shall be given to students who attend daily  (Education Code 8483, 8483.1, 8484.75)
			
			CSBA NOTE: Items #3-5 are optional and may be revised or expanded to include enrollment priorities established by the district.

			Any remaining capacity shall be filled by students selected at random
			 
			A waiting list shall be established to accommodate additional students if space becomes available
			 
		
		
	
	
	Attendance/Early Release
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 8483 and 8483.1 express legislative intent that elementary students attend the full program day of either the before-school or after-school program every day in which they participate, and districts are mandated to establish a policy regarding reasonable early daily release of students from the after-school program and reasonable late arrival to a before-school program. Education Code 8483 and 8483.1 allow districts to implement a flexible attendance schedule for students in middle or junior high school. Education Code 8483.1 specifies that, for before-school programs, students who attend less than one-half of the daily program hours may not be counted for attendance purposes.CDE's, "Early Release and Late Arrival Guidance," recommends that late arrival and early release policies be implemented by establishing codes for various reasons of early release or late arrival and includes sample codes.In contrast, CDE's, "Expanded Learning Opportunities Program FAQ," explains that ELOs  offered pursuant to Education Code 46120 do not have an attendance requirement, but rather districts are encouraged to track student attendance for safety and continuous quality improvement purposes.The following items should be revised to reflect district practice.
	
		Each student admitted into a district program shall be expected to attend the full number of hours that the program is in operation every day that the student participates
		
		An ELO offered pursuant to Education Code 46120 does not have an attendance requirement, but the district may track student attendance for safety and continuous quality improvement purposes.
		 
		When necessary, a student's parent/guardian may request, in writing, that the Superintendent or designee approve the reasonable late daily arrival for the before-school program or the reasonable early daily release from the after-school program
		
		The Superintendent or designee shall not approve such a request if the student would be attending less than one-half of the daily program hours.
		
		CSBA NOTE: Item #8 below is for use by districts that offer a program during summer, intersession, or vacation periods. Pursuant to Education Code 8483.76, a school that establishes a before-school or after-school program is eligible to receive a supplemental grant to operate the program in excess of 180 regular school days or during any combination of summer, weekends, intersession, or vacation periods for a maximum of 30 percent of the total grant amount awarded, per school year, to the school.Pursuant to Education Code 46120, ELOs are required to offer no less than nine hours of in-person expanded learning opportunities per day for at least 30 non-school days during extended school year or intersession periods.
	
	
	Summer/Intersession/Vacation Programs
	 
	
		ELOs shall offer no less than nine hours of in-person expanded learning opportunities per day for at least 30 non-school days, during extended school year or intersession periods  (Education Code 46120)

		An after-school program offered during summer, intersession, and/or vacation days may be operated for either three hours or six hours per day in accordance with Education Code 8483.76. When both before-school and after-school programs are offered for the same students on such days, they shall be operated for a minimum of four and one-half hours per day.  (Education Code 8483, 8483.1, 8483.2, 8483.76)
		 
		A program offered during summer, intersession, and/or vacation periods may open eligibility to every student attending a school in the district, with priority for enrollment given to students enrolled in the school that received the grant  (Education Code 8483.76)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46120, as amended by SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), a district that is temporarily prevented from operating its ELO because of a school site closure due to emergency conditions specified in Education Code 8482.8 or 41422, will not be subject to penalties as a result of the emergency if the Governing Board adopts a resolution and provides documentation substantiating the need for closure. For information regarding schedule changes due to emergencies, see BP 3516.5 - Emergency Schedules.
		To address the needs of students and school closures, the program may be conducted at an off-site location or an alternate school site
		
		When a district is temporarily prevented from operating an ELO because of a school or program site closure due to emergency conditions specified in Education Code 8482.8 or 41422, the Superintendent or designee shall complete and submit to the California Department of Education (CDE) any necessary forms or records substantiating the need for closure, including a resolution adopted by the Governing Board.  (Education Code 46120)
		
		The program shall notify CDE of the change of location and shall include a plan to provide safe transportation pursuant to Education Code 8484.6.  (Education Code 8483.76)
		 
		Any program operating for six hours per day shall provide at least one nutritionally adequate free or reduced-price meal to each eligible student during each program day  (Education Code 8483.76)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Education Code 8483.76 mandates that a district operating a six-hour program adopt an attendance and early release policy for the program that is consistent with the district's early release policy for the regular school day; see Item #7 above. This policy must be included in the program plan submitted to CDE.
		For any program operating six hours per day, district procedures pertaining to student attendance and early release as specified in Item #7 above shall apply  (Education Code 8483.76)
	
	

Grades 9-12

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts providing before-school and/or after-school programs funded through 21st Century High School After School Safety and Enrichment for Teens Program (ASSETs) (Education Code 8420-8428; 20 USC 7171-7176).Pursuant to Education Code 46120, districts may, but are not required to, serve students in grades 7-12 in ELOs.
The district's 21st Century High School After School Safety and Enrichment for Teens Program (ASSETs) shall serve students in any of grades 9-12 as the district may determine based on local needs.  (Education Code 8421)

CSBA NOTE:  The following paragraph reflects the collaborative planning requirements for the ASSETs program.
The district's ASSETs program shall be planned through a collaborative process that includes parents/guardians, students, and representatives of participating schools, governmental agencies including city and county parks and recreation departments, local law enforcement, community organizations, and, if appropriate, the private sector.  (Education Code 8422)

Volunteers

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that choose to create a registry of volunteer after-school physical recreation instructors or other volunteers pursuant to Education Code 35021.3, and may be used by districts that provide an ASES, 21st CCLC, ASSETs, ELO, or any other local program. When the district opts to use a registry created by a county office of education pursuant to Education Code 35021.3 rather than develop its own, the following section may be revised to inform district staff about the county registry and encourage its use.Pursuant to Education Code 35021.3, after-school instruction in physical recreation provided by a volunteer does not count toward satisfaction of physical education requirements pertaining to the number of instructional minutes or course completion for high school graduation; see BP/AR 6142.7 - Physical Education and Activity and BP 6146.1 - High School Graduation Requirements.
The Superintendent or designee may establish a registry of volunteer after-school physical recreation instructors and other before-school and after-school program volunteers.  (Education Code 35021.3)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35021.3 requires volunteers to submit to a criminal background check and authorizes, but does not require, the district to contribute funds to pay for all or part of the background check. Pursuant to Education Code 35021.3, the district may expand the following paragraph to impose additional requirements on volunteers (e.g., certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation).
To be included in the registry, a volunteer shall submit to a criminal background check pursuant to Education Code 45125. The volunteer shall also submit current contact information to the district and shall update that information whenever the information changes.  (Education Code 35021.3)

The Superintendent or designee may use a volunteer registered with the district or may select another person to provide physical recreation to students after school hours or to provide other services.  (Education Code 35021.3)

Reports

CSBA NOTE: The following section applies to ASES, 21st CCLC, and ASSETs programs.Pursuant to Education Code 8426 and 8484, CDE may terminate a grant if, for three consecutive years, the program fails to demonstrate measurable program outcomes or fails to attain 75 percent of its proposed attendance levels. For this purpose, CDE may consider a comparison of participating and nonparticipating students at the same school site or other factors.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually submit to CDE outcome-based data, including, but not limited to:  (Education Code 8427, 8482.3, 8484)

	For participating students, school day attendance on an annual basis and program attendance on a semi-annual basis
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 8427 requires programs to submit evidence of a program quality improvement process that is based on standards developed by CDE. Such program quality standards can be found in CDE's, "Quality Standards and Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI)," available on its website.

In contrast, ELOs are explicitly subject to some, but not all, of the ASES program requirements pursuant to Education Code 46120. However, CDE's webpage, "Expanded Learning Opportunities FAQs," emphasizes that districts are expected to uniformly apply the stricter ASES requirements to all programs since ASES, 21st CCLC, and ELO should be considered a single, comprehensive program. As such, the following section reflects the expectation that ELOs will comply with all the requirements for ASES and 21st CCLC programs.<br><br>The following section applies to ASES, 21st CCLC, and ELO programs, except where otherwise noted, and should be revised to reflect the program(s) offered by the district.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="NjMxNQ8" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22NjMxNQ8%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22xOQ192%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1733345976%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%208484.75%2C%20programs%20funded%20through%2021st%20CCLC%20are%20generally%20subject%20to%20the%20same%20program%20requirements%20applicable%20to%20ASES%2C%20with%20the%20exception%20of%20specified%20provisions%20primarily%20related%20to%20allocation%20of%20funds%2C%20collaboration%2C%20and%20data%20collection.%20In%20contrast%2C%20ELOs%20are%20explicitly%20subject%20to%20some%2C%20but%20not%20all%2C%20of%20the%20ASES%20program%20requirements%20pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2046120.%20However%2C%20CDE%27s%20webpage%2C%20%5C%22Expanded%20Learning%20Opportunities%20FAQs%2C%5C%22%20emphasizes%20that%20districts%20are%20expected%20to%20uniformly%20apply%20the%20stricter%20ASES%20requirements%20to%20all%20programs%20since%20ASES%2C%2021st%20CCLC%2C%20and%20ELO%20should%20be%20considered%20a%20single%2C%20comprehensive%20program.%20As%20such%2C%20the%20following%20section%20reflects%20the%20expectation%20that%20ELOs%20will%20comply%20with%20all%20the%20requirements%20for%20ASES%20and%2021st%20CCLC%20programs.%5Cn%5CnThe%20following%20section%20applies%20to%20ASES%2C%2021st%20CCLC%2C%20and%20ELO%20programs%2C%20except%20where%20otherwise%20noted%2C%20and%20should%20be%20revised%20to%20reflect%20the%20program%28s%29%20offered%20by%20the%20district.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-NjMxNQ8" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 8484.75, pro..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
