## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that poor school attendance and behavior problems negatively impact student achievement and put students at greater risk of dropping out of school. The Superintendent or designee shall establish a comprehensive and integrated system for the early identification of attendance problems and shall implement strategies to encourage students' attendance. After other interventions have been exhausted, students with a pattern of unexcused absences may be referred to a school attendance review board (SARB), in accordance with applicable law, in order to receive intensive guidance and assistance.

The SARB shall maintain a continuing inventory of community resources, including alternative educational programs.

The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with the SARB and appropriate community agencies, including, but not limited to, law enforcement agencies, child welfare agencies, and health services, to provide school-based and/or community-based interventions tailored to the specific needs of the student.

The Board shall appoint members to the District's SARB, who may include a parent/guardian as well as representatives of various agencies including, but not limited to, school districts;  the county probation department; the county welfare department; the County Superintendent of Schools; law enforcement agencies; community-based youth service centers; school guidance personnel; child welfare and attendance personnel; school or county health care personnel; school, county, or community mental health personnel; the county district attorney's office; and the county public defender's office.  (Education Code 48321)

The District's SARB shall provide support to improve student attendance and behavior through proactive efforts focused on building positive school environments and improved school connectedness, early identification and immediate intervention to re-engage students with poor attendance or behavior, and intensive intervention with students and families to address severe or persistent attendance or behavior issues.

The District's SARB shall operate in accordance with Education Code 48320-48325, the Brown Act (Government Code 54950-54963), and the bylaws of the SARB.

The SARB shall collect data and annually report outcomes on SARB referrals to the Board of Education, Superintendent or designee, and County Superintendent of Schools.  (Education Code 48273)
