## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Welfare and Institutions Code 18986-18986.30 encourage the development of a comprehensive and collaborative delivery system of services to children and youth at the local level. For further information about establishing collaborative structures among the leadership of local governments, see the Cities, Counties and Schools Partnership's web site.
The Governing Board believes that district efforts to provide a high-quality education for students in the community can be enhanced by collaboration with other government and public agencies that are responsible for the health, safety, and well-being of children and youth. The district shall initiate and maintain good working relationships with representatives of local agencies to maximize student and family access to support services that will help students achieve to their highest potential.

CSBA NOTE: In addition to any collaborative efforts that the district may initiate, there are a number of county structures in which district participation is appropriate. For example, if the County Board of Supervisors has established an Interagency Children's Services Coordinating Council pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code 18986.10-18986.15, that council must include at least one superintendent of a unified school district within the county. In addition, Welfare and Institutions Code 18980-18983.8 provide for the development of a Child Abuse Prevention Coordinating Council within each county and encourage representatives of public and private schools to be included on these councils. Pursuant to Health and Safety Code 130100-130155, counties also have established First 5 County Commissions which work to help children enter school physically and emotionally healthy and ready to succeed.
The Board shall initiate or participate in collaborative relationships with city and county elected officials to design and coordinate multi-agency programs that respond to the needs of children and families and provide more efficient use of district and community resources. To further such collaborations, the Board may establish or participate in formal structures for governance teams to regularly meet and discuss issues of mutual concern.

The Superintendent and appropriate staff shall cooperate with government and public agencies in the planning and implementation of joint projects or activities within the community. The Superintendent or designee may designate a coordinator to ensure effective implementation of the district's responsibilities in any such collaborative project.

In order to identify priorities for services, the Board shall encourage a periodic assessment of children's needs within the community, which may include, but not be limited to, needs based on poverty, child abuse and neglect, poor physical or mental health, substance abuse, violence, homelessness, placement in foster care, or lack of access to child care. The needs assessment should also examine the extent to which those needs are being met through existing services in the district and in the community, the costs of providing those services, and any gaps, delay, or duplication of services.

The Board shall approve the services to be offered by the district, the resources that will be allocated to support collaboration, any use of school facilities for services, and any development or joint use of facilities with other jurisdictions. All agreements with other agencies to coordinate services or share resources shall be in writing. The Board may establish joint powers agreements or memorandums of understanding, when feasible, to formalize the responsibilities and liabilities of all parties in a collaborative activity.

The Superintendent or designee shall work with interagency partners to explore funding opportunities available through each agency, state and national grant programs, and/or private foundations for youth service coordination and delivery.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49075 authorizes districts to permit access to student records to any person for whom a parent/guardian has provided written consent; see BP/AR 5125 - Student Records.
In order to facilitate service delivery or determination of eligibility for services, the district may share information with other appropriate agencies as long as the parent/guardian consents and the information is shared in accordance with laws pertaining to confidentiality and privacy.

The Board shall receive regular reports of progress toward the identified goals of the collaborative effort. The reports may include, but not be limited to, feedback from staff and families regarding service delivery, numbers of children and families served, specific indicators of conditions of children, and indicators of system efficiency and cost effectiveness.

The Board shall communicate with the community about the district's collaborative efforts and the conditions of children within the schools. The Board may advocate for local, state, and national policies, programs, and initiatives designed to improve the conditions of children and youth.
