## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE:  The following optional Board policy should be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 49600 urges districts to offer students a comprehensive educational counseling program that is implemented in a structured and coherent manner within a Multi-Tiered Systems of Support framework (MTSS). Pursuant to Education Code 49600, specialized services offered under such a program must be provided by appropriately credentialed school counselors.SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023) provides grant funding to eligible districts to establish safe, healthy, and supportive learning opportunities and environments in schools, which include, implementation of high quality integrated academic, behavioral, and social and emotional learning practices or services aligned to the MTSS.
The Governing Board recognizes that a structured, coherent, and comprehensive counseling program promotes academic achievement and growth, and serves the diverse needs of district students. The district shall provide an educational counseling program that offers students services and supports within a Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) framework, in accordance with law.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all persons employed to provide direct school counseling, school psychology, school social work services, child welfare and attendance services, and/or to implement equitable school programs and services that support students' academic and social and emotional development and college and career readiness possess the appropriate credential from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing authorizing their employment in such positions.

The Superintendent or designee shall establish and maintain a program of guidance, placement, and follow-up for all high school students subject to compulsory continuation education.  (Education Code 48431)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 54680-54685, as added by AB 278 (Ch. 424, Statutes of 2023), establishes the Dream Resource Grant Program with the goal of creating Dream Resource Centers at schools that serve students in grades 9-12. The funds may be used to create a center or to supplement, but not supplant, funding for an existing center. The following paragraph is for districts that receive such grant funding.
To enhance the educational counseling program and assist students in reaching their educational and professional goals, the district shall provide students in grades 9-12 with financial aid support; social services support; state-funded immigration legal services; academic opportunities; and parent/guardian and family workshops.  (Education Code 54680, 54683)

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 7908 requires districts receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to provide military recruiters with the same access to students as is provided to colleges and prospective employers. Districts that do not grant similar access may lose those funds, and, pursuant to 10 USC 503, may be subject to specific interventions, such as notification to the Governor and Congress so that public officials can work with the district. Districts that do not receive ESEA funds and that choose to grant access to college and employment recruiters should do so on a nondiscriminatory basis. Education Code 49603 provides that military service recruiters may not be denied on-campus access to students in grades 9-12 if the district provides such access to other employers. For information regarding military recruiter access to student directory information, see BP/AR 5125.1 - Release of Directory Information.Option 1 below is for use by districts that choose to adopt a policy that permits college and employment recruiters, including military recruiters, access to students. Option 2 is for districts that choose to adopt a policy that does not permit such access.
OPTION 1:  (Districts with policy that permits college, employment, and military recruiters access to students)

Colleges and prospective employers, including military recruiters, shall have the same access to students for recruiting purposes.  (Education Code 49603; 10 USC 503; 20 USC 7908)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Districts with policy that prohibits college, employment, and military recruiters access to students)

Colleges and prospective employers, including military recruiters, shall not have access to students for recruiting purposes.  (Education Code 49603; 10 USC 503)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Labor Code 3074.2, districts are encouraged to provide students with opportunities to explore, make career choices, and seek appropriate instruction and training to support those choices, by hosting locally focused apprenticeship and/or career and technical education fair events, such as college and career fairs.
The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with businesses, government agencies, postsecondary institutions including universities and career technical schools, community organizations, and/or other employers to provide students with actual or simulated work-based learning opportunities through college and/or career fairs.

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section applies to all districts, regardless of whether Option 1 or Option 2, above, is chosen.Labor Code 3074.2 requires any district planning to hold a college or career fair to identify approved apprenticeship programs in the county and notify such programs that they are hosting a college or career fair. To identify approved programs, the district is required to rely on the database of approved apprenticeship programs published by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards on its website.
When planning to hold a college or career fair, the Superintendent or designee shall notify each apprenticeship program in the county. The notification shall include the planned date, time, and location of the college or career fair.  (Labor Code 3074.2)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52770, as added by AB 1173 (Ch. 23, Statutes of 2023), requires a district that serves students in any of grades 9-12 that is planning to hold a college or career fair to notify each community college district that has overlapping jurisdiction of the date, time, and location of the fair, and provide an opportunity for the community college district to participate.

Additionally, the district shall provide the notification to any community college district that has overlapping jurisdiction with the district and an opportunity for the community college district to participate in the college or career fair.  (Education Code 52770)

Personal or Mental Health Counseling

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice. A school counselor, school psychologist, or school social worker may offer personal or family counseling in accordance with the authorizations on their credentials. Additionally, districts may provide mental health services through school-based health centers and/or may collaborate with community agencies, organizations, and health care providers to ensure that services are available. For more information regarding school health centers, see BP 5141.6 - School Health Services.
A school counselor, school psychologist, or school social worker may provide individualized personal, mental health, or family counseling to students in accordance with the specialization(s) authorized by their credential. Such services may include, but are not limited to, support related to the student's social and emotional development, behavior, substance abuse, mental health assessment, depression, or mental illness. As appropriate, students and their parents/guardians shall be informed about community agencies, organizations, or health care providers that offer qualified professional assistance.

CSBA NOTE: AB 665 (Ch. 338, Statutes of 2023) repealed and added Family Code 6924 to make it consistent with Health and Safety Code 124260 which allows a minor age 12 or older to consent to outpatient mental health counseling or treatment services without parent/guardian consent if, in the opinion of a school psychologist or other professional person, as defined, the minor is mature enough to participate intelligently in the services, without having to establish that the minor would present a danger of serious physical or mental harm to themself or others without the mental counseling or treatment services or that the minor is an alleged victim of incest or child abuse. However, pursuant to Family Code 6924, as added by AB 665, the child's parent/guardian must still be involved unless the professional person determines, after consulting with the minor, that it would be inappropriate.
Written parent/guardian consent shall be obtained before mental health counseling or treatment services are provided to a student, except when the student is authorized to consent to the service pursuant to Family Code 6924, Health and Safety Code 124260, or other applicable law.

Any information of a personal nature disclosed to a school counselor by a student age 12 years or older or by the student's parent/guardian is confidential and shall not become part of the student record without the written consent of the person who disclosed the confidential information. The information shall not be revealed, released, discussed, or referred to except under the limited circumstances specified in Education Code 49602.  (Education Code 49602)

A counselor shall consult with the Superintendent or designee and, as appropriate, with the district's legal counsel whenever there is uncertainty regarding how to respond to a student's personal problem or when questions arise regarding the possible release of confidential information regarding a student.

Crisis Counseling

The Board recognizes the need for a prompt and effective response when students are confronted with a traumatic incident. School counselors shall assist in the development of the emergency and disaster preparedness plan and other prevention and intervention practices designed to assist students and parents/guardians before, during, and after a crisis.

Early identification and intervention plans shall be developed to help identify those students who may be at risk for violence so that support may be provided before they engage in violent or disruptive behavior.

Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall identify crisis counseling resources to train district staff in effective threat assessment, appropriate response techniques, and/or methods to directly help students cope with a crisis if it occurs.

Teacher-Based Advisory Program

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that choose to provide a teacher-based advisory program as authorized by Education Code 49600. The following section may be revised to reflect district practice, including the grade levels at which the program will operate. It should be deleted by districts in which all student counseling is provided by credentialed school counselors.
The Board recognizes that a supportive, ongoing relationship with a caring adult can provide a student with valuable advice, enhance student-teacher relationships, and build the student's feelings of connectedness with the school. The Board authorizes the development of a teacher-based advisory program in which teachers advise students in such areas as academic planning, character development, conflict resolution, and self-esteem. Any teacher participating in this program shall be under the supervision of a credentialed school counselor as appropriate, receive related information and training, and be subject to law and this Board policy, including requirements pertaining to student confidentiality and nondiscrimination.
