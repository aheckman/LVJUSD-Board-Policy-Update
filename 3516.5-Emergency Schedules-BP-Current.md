## Policy Content

In order to provide for the safety of students and staff, the Governing Board authorizes the Superintendent or designee to close a school site, change the regular school day schedule, or take any necessary action when hazardous environmental, health, or weather conditions, or other emergencies, warrant.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 41422 and 46392, a district may apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction to obtain apportionment credit for days and minutes lost due to emergency closure and material decreases in attendance due to emergency events such as a fire, flood, impassable roads, epidemic, earthquake, imminence of a major safety hazard, strike involving transportation services to students provided by a nonschool entity, other "extraordinary condition", or, as amended by SB 1429 (Ch. 477, Statutes of 2024), snowstorms, so that it may receive full average daily attendance apportionment.
When an emergency condition causes a school closure, reduction in attendance, or change in schedule pursuant to Education Code 41422 or 46392, thereby preventing the district from complying with the minimum number of instructional days or minutes required by law, the Superintendent or designee shall complete and submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) the necessary forms and/or affidavits for obtaining approval of apportionment credit for the days of the closure, reduction in attendance, or change in schedule. The Superintendent or designee shall submit other relevant district records as may be required.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 46393, as amended by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024) and AB 176 (Ch. 998, Statutes of 2024), requires districts submitting affidavits regarding emergency events occurring after September 1, 2021 but before July 1, 2026, to certify that the district has a plan for offering independent study to impacted students within 10 instructional days of the first day of a school closure or material decrease in attendance. For events occurring on or after July 1, 2026, Education Code 46393, as amended by SB 153 and AB 176, requires districts to certify that the district's comprehensive safety plan includes an instructional continuity plan, and that the district offered student engagement and instruction consistent with the instructional continuity plan, or certify that it did not do so due to extenuating circumstances.
For school closures or material decreases in attendance due to emergency events that occur between September 2, 2021 and June 30, 2026, the Superintendent or designee shall certify in the affidavit submitted to the SPI that the district has a plan for offering independent study within 10 instructional days of the school closure to any student impacted by the emergency condition. The plan shall address the establishment, within a reasonable time, of independent study master agreements as specified in Board Policy 6158 - Independent Study, and require reopening in person as soon as possible once allowable under the direction from the city or county health officer.   (Education Code 46393)

For school closures or material decreases in attendance due to emergency events occurring on or after July 1, 2026, the Superintendent or designee shall certify in the affidavit submitted to the SPI that the district's comprehensive safety plan includes an instructional continuity plan, and that the district offered student engagement and instruction consistent with the instructional continuity plan, or that it did not do so due to extenuating circumstances.  (Education Code 46393)

CSBA NOTE: Vehicle Code 34501.6 mandates the Governing Board of any district that provides student transportation to adopt procedures that limit the home-to-school operation of school buses when atmospheric conditions reduce visibility to 200 feet or less; see AR 3543 - Transportation Safety and Emergencies for language implementing this mandate. The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish a system for informing students and parents/guardians with timely notice in advance of any changes to the school day, a school closure, or if school buses are not operating as scheduled. The district's notification system shall include, but is not limited to, notifying local television, streaming services, and/or radio stations; posting on district website(s) and/or social media account(s); sending email and text messages; and/or making telephone calls.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Public Utilities Code 2874, as amended by AB 2905 (Ch. 316, Statutes of 2024), when a district or school uses an automatic dialing-announcing device, the person making calls and operating the device is required, prior to operating the device, to personally make an unrecorded, natural voice announcement to those being called which (1) states the nature of the call and the name, address, and telephone number of the district or school, (2) inquires whether the person called consents to hear the prerecorded message of the person calling, and (3) informs the person if the prerecorded message uses an artificial voice. Districts and schools are required to disconnect the device from the telephone line upon the termination of the call.
When the district makes any notification to students and/or parents/guardians utilizing an automatic dialing-announcing device, the device shall be operated by a person who shall follow all procedures required by law prior to operating the device, and disconnect the device from the telephone line upon the termination of the call.  (Public Utilities Code 2874)

Whenever the school day schedule changes after students have arrived at school, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that students are supervised in accordance with the procedures specified in Board Policy/Administrative Regulation 3516 - Emergencies and Disaster Preparedness Plan.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for districts that provide a means for students to make up lost instructional time due to an emergency and may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 46211, as added by SB 153, a district may, beginning July 1, 2025, implement attendance recovery programs for students in grades transitional kindergarten-12 to make up lost instructional time and offset absences due to emergency events, for up to 10 days of attendance in a school year or the number of absences a student accrued in that school year, whichever is less. A student's participation in an attendance recovery program may not be compulsory or punitive. Attendance recovery programs may be operated before or after school, on weekends, or during intersessional periods. However, Education Code 46210, as added by SB 153, expresses legislative intent that access to instruction as part of a regular instructional program is the preferred method of student learning and that the availability of attendance recovery should not discourage districts that regularly experience school closures from maintaining school calendars of greater than 180 days to maximize instruction in the regular instructional program. For more information regarding attendance recovery programs, see BP/AR 5113.1 - Chronic Absence and Truancy.
The Superintendent or designee may provide a means to make up lost instructional time later during the year.
