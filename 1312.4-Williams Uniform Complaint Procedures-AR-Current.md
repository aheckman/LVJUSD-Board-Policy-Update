CSBA NOTE: Education Code 242, as added by AB 1078 (Ch. 229, Statutes of 2023), requires the California Department of Education (CDE) to develop, by July 1, 2025, guidance and public educational materials to ensure that all Californians can access information about educational laws and policies that safeguard the right to an accurate and inclusive curriculum.Pursuant to Education Code 60119, boards are required to hold a public hearing annually regarding the sufficiency of instructional materials. If, at the public hearing, the Governing Board makes a determination of "insufficient materials", Education Code 1240, as amended by AB 1078, requires the Board to take certain actions and specifies potential consequences for not remedying the deficiency as required by law; see BP 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials. For more information regarding the Board's responsibilities regarding the sufficiency of instructional materials, see CSBA's Governance Brief, "Instructional Materials Adoptions: State and local governing board processes, roles, and responsibilities," and Fact Sheet, "Instructional Materials Adoptions: Local governing board responsibilities."

		A semester begins and a teacher vacancy exists
		
		CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35186, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), requires that the Williams uniform complaint procedure be used to address a complaint related to teacher misassignment that claims that a teacher who lacks credentials or training to teach English learners is assigned to teach a class with one or more English learners in the class.

		A condition poses an emergency or urgent threat to the health or safety of students or staff
		
		Emergency or urgent threat means structures or systems that are in a condition that poses a threat to the health and safety of students or staff while at school, including, but not limited to, gas leaks; nonfunctioning heating, ventilation, fire sprinklers, or air-conditioning systems; electrical power failure; major sewer line stoppage; major pest or vermin infestation; broken windows or exterior doors or gates that will not lock and that pose a security risk; abatement of hazardous materials previously undiscovered that pose an immediate threat to students or staff; structural damage creating a hazardous or uninhabitable condition; or any other condition deemed appropriate.  (Education Code 17592.72)
		 
		A school restroom has not been cleaned, maintained, or kept open in accordance with Education Code 35292.5
		
		Clean or maintained school restroom means a school restroom has been cleaned or maintained regularly, is fully operational, or has been stocked at all times with toilet paper, soap, and paper towels or functional hand dryers. (Education Code 35292.5)

Open restroom means the school has kept all restrooms open during school hours when students are not in classes and has kept a sufficient number of restrooms open during school hours when students are in classes. This does not apply when the temporary closing of the restroom is necessary for a documented student safety concern, an immediate threat to student safety, or to repair the facility.  (Education Code 35292.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that maintain any of grades 3-12, and may be revised to reflect the grade levels served by the district.Pursuant to Education Code 35292.6, as amended by AB 230 (Ch. 421, Statutes of 2023), the requirement to stock the school's restrooms with menstrual products, for use in connection with the menstrual cycle, free of charge has been expanded to include schools that serve students in any of grades 3-12. See AR 3517 - Facilities Inspection.Although Education Code 35292.6 does not require a complaint process, it is recommended that the Williams uniform complaint procedures be used to address any allegation of noncompliance with Education Code 35292.6 in order to ensure consistency in the procedures that districts use to address allegations of noncompliance with all restroom maintenance requirements. However, pursuant to 5 CCR 4610, CDE will not accept an appeal of any such complaint .
In any school serving students any of grades 3-12, a complaint may be filed alleging noncompliance with the requirement of Education Code 35292.6 to, at all times, stock and make available and accessible free of cost, an adequate supply of menstrual products in every women's and all-gender restroom, and in at least one men's restroom.  (Education Code 35292.6)

CSBA NOTE: Beginning July 1, 2026, Education Code 35292.5, as amended by SB 760, requires each school to provide and maintain at least one all-gender restroom for student use, as described below. The district is required to ensure that an employee is designated as a point of contact to implement these requirements for each school, and that a notice regarding the requirements be posted in a prominent and conspicuous location outside the all-gender restroom, including contact information for the designated point of contact. CDE is required to post on its website guidance for implementation of the requirements specified in Education Code 35292.5, including examples of signage and best practices.As with Education Code 35292.6 described above, Education Code 35292.5, as amended by SB 760, does not require a complaint process. However, it is recommended that the Williams complaint procedures be used to address allegations of noncompliance with Education Code 35292.5 in order to ensure consistency in the procedures districts use to address allegations of noncompliance with all restroom maintenance requirements. Like complaints alleging noncompliance with Education Code 35292.6, CDE will not accept an appeal of a complaint alleging noncompliance with Education Code 35292.5.
Additionally, starting July 1, 2026, in any school that has more than one female and more than one male restroom designated exclusively for student use, a complaint may be filed alleging noncompliance with the requirements specified in Education Code 35292.5 to maintain at least one all-gender restroom for student use.  (Education Code 35292.5)

Forms and Notices

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure a Williams complaint form is available at each school. However, complainants need not use the district's complaint form in order to file a complaint.  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4680)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35186 requires that the district's complaint form contain the elements stated in the following paragraph. In addition, Education Code 35186 requires that a notice be posted in each classroom in each school in the district, as specified below. See the accompanying exhibits for a sample complaint form and classroom notice.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's complaint form specifies the location for filing a complaint and contains a space to indicate whether the complainant desires a response to the complaint. A complainant may add as much text to explain the complaint as desired.  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4680)

The Superintendent or designee shall post in each classroom in each school a notice containing the components specified in Education Code 35186.  (Education Code 35186)

Filing of Complaint

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35186 requires that complaints be investigated and resolved within the timelines specified below. During the Federal Program Monitoring (FPM) process, CDE staff will expect to see statements regarding the filing of the complaint, the investigation, timelines, and the complainant's right to appeal to the Board and to appeal facilities complaints to CDE, as detailed in the following section and the section "Investigation and Response" below.
A complaint alleging any condition(s) specified in the section "Types of Complaints" above shall be filed with the principal or designee at the school in which the complaint arises. A complaint about problems beyond the authority of the principal shall be forwarded to the Superintendent or designee in a timely manner, but not to exceed 10 working days. Complaints may be filed anonymously.  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4680)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35186, as amended by AB 1078, complaints related to instructional materials alleging that more than one student does not have sufficient textbooks or instructional materials as the result of an act by the Board, or the Board's failure to remedy the deficiency, may be filed with the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) directly in addition to or in lieu of being filed with the district, and the SPI may directly intervene without waiting for an investigation, as described below.Pursuant to Education Code 60150, as added by AB 1078, if the SPI finds that a district has not provided sufficient textbooks or instructional materials as required, CDE is required to take all remedial actions as specified in Education Code 1240, including purchasing textbooks and instructional materials. Additionally, the SPI is required to assess a financial penalty against the district's local control funding formula allocation.
A complaint alleging that more than one student does not have sufficient textbooks or instructional materials as the result of an act by the Governing Board, or the Board's failure to remedy the deficiency, may be filed with the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) directly in addition to or in lieu of being filed with the district. Any such complaint shall identify the basis and provide evidence to support its filing directly with the SPI.  (Education Code 35186)

If the Superintendent or designee becomes aware that a complaint alleging insufficient textbooks or instructional materials has been filed directly with the SPI but not with the district, the Superintendent or designee may initiate an investigation in accordance with this administrative regulation, as described below, if there is sufficient evidence to do so.

Investigation and Response

The principal or a designee of the Superintendent shall make all reasonable efforts to investigate any problem within the principal's or designee's authority.  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4685)

The principal or Superintendent's designee shall remedy a valid complaint within a reasonable time period not to exceed 30 working days from the date the complaint was received.  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4685)

If the complainant has indicated on the complaint form a desire to receive a response to the complaint, the principal or Superintendent's designee shall send written resolution of the complaint to the mailing address of the complainant as indicated on the complaint within 45 working days of the initial filing of the complaint. If the principal makes this report, the information shall be reported at the same time to the Superintendent or designee.  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4680, 4685)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48985 specifies that, when 15 percent or more of the students enrolled in a particular school speak a single primary language other than English, all notices, reports, statements, or records sent to the parents/guardians of such students be written in English and in the primary language. Education Code 35186 requires that, when Education Code 48985 is applicable, any response requested by the complainant must be written in English and in the primary language in which the complaint was filed.
When Education Code 48985 is applicable and the complainant has requested a response, the response shall be written in English and in the primary language in which the complaint was filed.  (Education Code 35186)

If a complainant is not satisfied with the resolution of a complaint, the complainant has the right to describe the complaint to the Governing Board at a regularly scheduled meeting.  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4686)

For any complaint concerning a facilities condition that poses an emergency or urgent threat to the health or safety of students or staff as described in Item #3a in the section "Types of Complaints" above, a complainant who is not satisfied with the resolution proffered by the principal or Superintendent or designee may file an appeal to the SPI within 15 days of receiving the district's response. The complainant shall comply with the appeal requirements specified in 5 CCR 4632.   (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4610, 4687)

However, no other type of complaint regarding the condition of school facilities as described in the section "Types of Complaints" above may be appealed to the SPI.  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4610, 4687)

All complaints and written responses shall be public records.  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4686)

Reports

CSBA NOTE: During the FPM process, CDE staff will expect to see the following statement.
On a quarterly basis, the Superintendent or designee shall report, to the Board at a regularly scheduled Board meeting and to the County Superintendent of Schools, summarized data on the nature and resolution of all complaints. The report shall include the number of complaints by general subject area with the number of resolved and unresolved complaints.  (Education Code 35186; 5 CCR 4686)
