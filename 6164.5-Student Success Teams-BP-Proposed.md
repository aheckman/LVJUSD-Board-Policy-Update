## Policy Content

The Board of Education encourages the collaboration of parents/guardians, certificated and classified staff, administrators, and/or the student, as appropriate, in evaluating the strengths and needs of students having academic, attendance, social, emotional, or behavioral difficulties and in identifying strategies and programs that may assist such students in maximizing their potential.  The Superintendent or designee shall establish student success teams (SST) as needed to address individual student needs.

SSTs shall be initiated through the Coordination of Services Team (COST), which may include referral by District staff or parents/guardians. Individual school sites shall designate a member of the COST team to respond to SST referrals.

Each SST may collect and analyze relevant student data, as appropriate. The SST may also review the student's educational history, work samples, strengths and areas for growth, and identify available resources and strategies.

Each SST shall develop a plan to support the student which incorporates intervention strategies  Such strategies may include changes in program placement or instructional methods, recommendation of supplemental educational services, parent involvement strategies, social, emotional and/or behavioral interventions, discipline, referrals to other agencies or resources, and/or other appropriate interventions. The SST must include evidence of parent or family involvement in the development of the plan and document the student's strengths and interests.

The COST and/or SST shall monitor the student's progress, evaluate the extent to which the recommended strategies have been implemented, make adjustments to the plan, and develop additional interventions as needed. Adjustment and additional interventions shall be documented and included with SST documentation.

A copy of the SST and evidence of progress monitoring shall be included in the student's cumulative record.

The SST process shall not delay or deny a referral for evaluation for eligibility for special education, as may be required under state or federal law.

The Superintendent or designee may integrate SSTs into the District's multi-tiered system of support, including identification of students who need additional support, the level(s) of support, appropriate interventions, monitoring of progress, and whether the goal of intervention has been met.

To strengthen the effectiveness of SSTs, the Superintendent or designee may provide staff development in the identification of students who may need additional support, implementation of measurable and targeted interventions, and monitoring of progress and goal attainment.
