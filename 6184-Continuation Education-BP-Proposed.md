## Policy Content

The Board of Education shall provide a continuation education program as an option for at-risk students who may need a flexible educational environment.  The continuation education program shall be designed to meet the educational needs of each student, provide an opportunity for participating students to complete the required course of instruction necessary to graduate from high school, emphasize occupational orientation or a work study schedule, and offer intensive guidance services.

The continuation education program shall be aligned with the goals identified in the District's local control and accountability plan, designed and implemented in collaboration with other high schools within the District, and coordinated with other educational options available to District students.

The Superintendent or designee shall appoint a director of continuation education who shall be responsible for the organization and administration of the District's continuation education program and guidance, placement, and follow-up services for participating students.  (5 CCR 11000, 11003)

The continuation high school shall be conducted for not less than 175 days during a school year.  The Board may maintain continuation classes during the District's regular school hours, during special school hours for these classes established by the Board, or during such hours and for such length of time during the day or evening that adult education classes are maintained.  (Education Code 48434; 5 CCR 11004)

Students eligible for continuation education classes shall be age 16 or 17 years at the time of their enrollment and shall not have graduated from high school.  (Education Code 48400, 48413)

A student may be involuntarily transferred into a continuation education program in accordance with law and administrative regulation.  (Education Code 48432.5)

With the consent of the Superintendent or designee, a student may voluntarily enroll in continuation classes in order to receive special attention such as individualized instruction. (Education Code 48432, 48432.3, 48432.5)

Priority for voluntary enrollment in continuation classes shall be given to students who need credit recovery in order to graduate with their peers and to students who, due to employment, pregnancy, parenting responsibilities, or other circumstances, are unable to attend a comprehensive high school. A student with a disability shall be admitted only if his/her individualized education program specifically states that a continuation high school setting meets his/her needs.

Enrollment criteria shall be applied consistently throughout the District.  (Education Code 48432.3)

Students may be enrolled in a regional occupational center or program within the county in lieu of, or in combination with, continuation education.  (Education Code 48432)

Students otherwise subject to compulsory attendance in continuation education classes may be exempted if they meet any of the conditions specified in Education Code 48410 and AR 5112.1 - Exemptions from Attendance.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly evaluate the effectiveness of District continuation education programs and report these evaluation results to the Board.  Indicators may include, but not be limited to, disaggregated data on student enrollment, student assessment results, and graduation rates.
