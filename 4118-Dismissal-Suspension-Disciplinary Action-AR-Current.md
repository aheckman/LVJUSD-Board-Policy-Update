## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation is subject to collective bargaining and should be revised in accordance with any applicable collective bargaining agreements. To the extent that this policy is inconsistent with provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement would prevail, so long as the provision is consistent with law.Pursuant to Government Code 3543.2, the district and certificated employee bargaining unit must, upon request of either party, negotiate causes and procedures for disciplinary action, other than dismissal and suspension beyond 15 days. If the Governing Board has adopted a collective bargaining agreement that includes such procedures, then, pursuant to Education Code 44932, the authorization to suspend an employee for up to 15 days pursuant to the procedures specified in Education Code 44933, 44934, 44934.1, 44935, 44936, 44937, 44943, and 44944 would not apply. The suspension procedures specified in Education Code 44934 and 44939 are explicitly for use only by districts that do not have such a provision in their collective bargaining agreement.Because Education Code provisions pertaining to employee suspension and dismissal are complex, districts are advised to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel before instituting such proceedings.
Causes for Suspension or Dismissal

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44932 lists causes for which a certificated employee may be suspended without pay or dismissed.The causes listed in Education Code 44932 have been found to be so broad as to be sometimes difficult to apply. However, the California Supreme Court, in Morrison v. State Board of Education, has articulated multiple factors to determine fitness to teach, which is the relevant inquiry under most of the causes for dismissal or suspension. The factors include: (1) the likelihood that the conduct may have adversely affected others and the degree of such adversity anticipated, (2) the proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct, (3) the type of certification held by the party involved, (4) the extenuating or aggravating circumstances, if any, surrounding the conduct, (5) the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct, (6) the likelihood of the recurrence of the questioned conduct, (7) the extent to which disciplinary action may inflict an adverse impact or chilling effect upon the constitutional rights of the teacher involved or other teachers, and (8) the notoriety associated with the conduct or behavior. The conduct or performance that gives rise to the need to suspend or dismiss need not occur on or involve district property but there must be some nexus to employment.
A certificated employee with permanent status may be suspended without pay or dismissed only for one or more of the following causes:  (Education Code 44932)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 12954, the district may not discriminate against a person in termination or any term or condition of employment, based on the person's use of cannabis when off the job or away from the workplace, and consequently, districts may be prohibited from disciplining employees in certain circumstances. However, certain employees may be subject to stricter laws related to drug testing. Districts with questions about drug testing employees should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.


	Immoral conduct including, but not limited to, egregious misconduct that is the basis for a sex offense or controlled substance offense described in Education Code 44010 or 44011 or child abuse and neglect as described in Penal Code 11165.2-11165.6
	 
	Unprofessional conduct
	 
	Commission, aiding, or advocating the commission of acts of criminal syndicalism
	 
	Dishonesty
	 
	Unsatisfactory performance
	 
	Evident unfitness for service
	 
	Physical or mental condition unfitting the employee to instruct or associate with children
	 
	Persistent violation of or refusal to obey the school laws or reasonable regulations of the state or district
	 
	Conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude
	 
	Violation of Education Code 51530 or Government Code 1028 prohibiting the advocacy or teaching of communism
	 
	Alcoholism or other drug abuse that makes the employee unfit to instruct or associate with children

An employee may be suspended or dismissed on grounds of unprofessional conduct consisting of acts or omissions not listed above if the charge specifies instances of behavior deemed to constitute unprofessional conduct.  (Education Code 44933)

Suspension/Dismissal of Permanent Employees

CSBA NOTE: Procedures for the suspension or dismissal of permanent employees are addressed in Education Code 44932-44947.See the accompanying Board policy for information about Board responsibilities related to reviewing the statement of charges, providing notice to the employee of the Board's intent to suspend or dismiss the employee, and, when applicable, appointing a member of the Commission on Professional Competence that will conduct a hearing on the matter.
When a permanent certificated employee is charged with one or more of the offenses specified in the section "Causes for Suspension or Dismissal" above, the following procedures shall apply:

	The person preparing a written statement of charges that there is cause to suspend or dismiss an employee shall submit the signed statement to the Governing Board, or a written statement of charges shall be formulated by the Board that cause to suspend or dismiss the permanent employee exists.  (Education Code 44934, 44934.1)
	 
	The employee, upon receiving notice of the Board's intent to suspend or dismiss, may request a hearing on the matter. The hearing shall be conducted by the Commission on Professional Competence, except that any case involving only egregious misconduct shall be heard instead by an administrative law judge and, in any other case, the hearing may be conducted by an administrative law judge when both the district and the employee so stipulate.  (Education Code 44943, 44944, 44944.05, 44944.1, 44944.3)
	 
	Except when the employee is charged solely with egregious misconduct, the district may amend the charges less than 90 days before the hearing only upon showing of good cause and upon approval of the administrative law judge.  (Education Code 44934)
	 
	The employee shall be suspended or dismissed when the Commission on Professional Competence or administrative law judge has issued its decision upholding suspension or dismissal or, if the employee did not request a hearing, at the expiration of 30 days after service of the notice of intent to suspend or dismiss.  (Education Code 44941, 44943, 44944)

The Superintendent or designee shall notify the Commission on Teacher Credentialing when the employment status of a certificated employee has been changed as a result of alleged misconduct or while an allegation of misconduct is pending.  (Education Code 44030.5, 44242.5, 44940; 5 CCR 80303)

Suspension/Dismissal of Probationary Employees

CSBA NOTE: With proper notice, the district may choose not to rehire probationary employees for the following year without giving a statement of reasons; see BP 4116 - Probationary/Permanent Status. However, during the school year, probationary employees may only be suspended without pay or dismissed for cause and in accordance with the applicable procedures specified in law.
The district may choose not to rehire probationary employees for the following school year without giving a statement of reasons if proper notice is provided by March 15 of the employee's second, complete, consecutive year of employment.  (Education Code 44929.21, 44929.23)

CSBA NOTE: Districts with average daily attendance (ADA) of 250 or more may dismiss probationary employees during the school year in accordance with the procedures contained in Education Code 44948.3, in which case the decision whether to dismiss an employee rests with the Board rather than the Commission on Professional Competence (Option 1 below).Districts with less than 250 ADA should select the appropriate option below depending on how the district grants permanent status to certificated employees in accordance with BP/AR 4116 - Probationary/Permanent Status. Districts with less than 250 ADA that have not adopted a collective bargaining agreement may elect to use the procedures in Education Code 44934 and 44934.1 for dismissal of probationary employees (Option 2 below), as reflected in the section "Suspension/Dismissal of Permanent Employees" above. Alternatively, Education Code 44948.2 authorizes districts with less than 250 ADA to elect to dismiss probationary employees during the school year pursuant to Education Code 44948.3 (Option 1 below). When districts with less than 250 ADA decide to use the procedures in Education Code 44948.3, their employees will become permanent employees if they are not served with a notice of non-reelection before March 15 of their second year. Since Education Code 44948.3 applies only to dismissal of probationary employees in districts with 250 ADA or more or to districts of less than 250 ADA that elect to use Education Code 44948.3, it is not appropriate for use by districts that either grant permanent status after three consecutive years or that reelect employees from year to year without granting permanent status.
OPTION 1: (Districts with ADA of 250 or more, or districts with less than 250 ADA that have elected to use the dismissal procedures in Education Code 44948.3)

During the school year, a probationary employee who is in the first or second year of service may be dismissed only for one or more of the causes listed in Items #1-11 in the section "Causes for Suspension or Dismissal" above or for unsatisfactory performance determined pursuant to Education Code 44660-44665.  (Education Code 44948.2, 44948.3)

Whenever a first- or second-year probationary employee is so charged, the following procedures shall apply for dismissing the employee during the school year:  (Education Code 44948.3)

	The Superintendent or designee shall give 30 days' prior written notice of dismissal, not later than March 15 in the case of second-year probationary employees. The notice shall include a statement of the reasons for the dismissal, notice of the opportunity to appeal, and, if the cause is unsatisfactory performance, a copy of the evaluation conducted pursuant to Education Code 44664.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44948.3, the probationary employee may request a hearing as provided below. The employee's failure to request a hearing within 15 days from receipt of the dismissal notice constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.
	Upon receipt of the notice of dismissal, the employee may be dismissed if no request for a hearing is submitted to the Board within 15 days.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44948.3 authorizes the district to establish procedures for the appointment of an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing and submit a recommended decision to the Board. Item #3 may be revised to reflect any such procedures established by the district.
	If a hearing is requested, the district may arrange for the appointment of an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing and to recommend a decision to the Board.

A probationary employee may be suspended without pay for a specified period of time as an alternative to dismissal.  (Education Code 44948.3)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Districts with less than 250 ADA that do not grant permanent status after two years and do not elect to use the procedures in Education Code 44948.3)

During the school year, probationary employees may be dismissed only for one or more of the causes listed in Items #1-11 in the section "Causes for Suspension or Dismissal" above.  (Education Code 44948)

Whenever a probationary employee is so charged, dismissal procedures shall be those set forth in Education Code 44934 and 44934.1 as described in the section "Suspension/Dismissal of Permanent Employees" above.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

Compulsory Leave of Absence

CSBA NOTE: Whenever a certificated employee is charged with a "mandatory leave of absence offense" as defined in Education Code 44940, the district is required to place the employee on a compulsory leave of absence. Penal Code 291 requires law enforcement, including the local police, sheriff, or California Highway Patrol, to telephone the Superintendent when a school employee has been arrested for a sex offense and provide written notice to the County Superintendent of Schools and the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC).Pursuant to Education Code 44009 and 44425, CTC will revoke the credential of an individual who has been convicted of a mandatory leave of absence offense.
Upon being informed that a certificated employee has been charged with a "mandatory leave of absence offense," the Superintendent or designee shall immediately place the employee on a leave of absence. A mandatory leave of absence offense includes:  (Education Code 44830.1, 44940)

	Any sex offense as defined in Education Code 44010
	 
	Violation or attempted violation of Penal Code 187, prohibiting murder or attempted murder
	 
	Any offense involving the unlawful sale, use, or exchange to minors of controlled substances as listed in Health and Safety Code 11054, 11055, and 11056

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44940 permits the Board to place certificated employees on leave for certain "optional leave of absence offenses" as defined below.The following optional paragraph should be revised to reflect offenses which the Board has determined will require a compulsory leave of absence.
The Superintendent or designee may place on an immediate compulsory leave of absence a certificated employee who is charged with an "optional leave of absence offense," defined as a controlled substance offense specified in Education Code 44011 and Health and Safety Code 11357-11361, 11363, 11364, and 11370.1, except as it relates to marijuana, mescaline, peyote, or tetrahydrocannabinol.  (Education Code 44940)

If an employee is charged with an offense that falls into both the mandatory and optional leave of absence definitions, the offense shall be treated as a mandatory leave of absence offense.  (Education Code 44940)

An employee's compulsory leave for a mandatory or optional leave of absence offense may extend for not more than 10 days after the entry of judgment in the criminal proceedings. However, the compulsory leave may be extended if the Board gives notice, within 10 days after the entry of judgment in the proceedings, that the employee will be dismissed within 30 days from the date of service of the notice unless a hearing is demanded.  (Education Code 44940, 44940.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44940.5, while on compulsory leave, the employee's salary may be paid if the employee provides a suitable bond or other acceptable security as a guarantee that the leave-period salary will be repaid if the employee is convicted of the charges or fails to return to district service. If the employee is acquitted or the charges are dismissed, the district must reimburse the employee for the cost of the bond upon return to service in the district. If an employee who does not furnish a bond or other security is acquitted or the charges are dismissed, the district must pay the employee's salary for the time spent on leave upon return to service.Education Code 44940.5 specifies that, if the charges against an employee are dismissed as a result of the employee's successful completion of a drug diversion program and the employee returns to service, the employee may elect to receive payment for any accrued leave and differential pay for the length of the employee's leave of absence.
During the period of compulsory leave, the employee shall be compensated in accordance with Education Code 44940.5.

Upon receipt of telephone or electronic notification from the Department of Justice that a current temporary, substitute, or probationary employee serving before March 15 of the second probationary year has been convicted of a violent or serious felony, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately place the employee on leave without pay. Upon receipt of electronic notification of the conviction from the Department of Justice, such employee shall be automatically terminated and without regard to any other termination procedure.  (Education Code 44830.1)

The Superintendent or designee may place on an immediate compulsory leave of absence a certificated employee who is charged with an &quot;optional leave of absence offense,&quot; defined as a controlled substance offense specified in Education Code 44011 and Health and Safety Code 11357-11361, 11363, 11364, and 11370.1, except as it relates to marijuana, mescaline, peyote, or tetrahydrocannabinol. &nbsp;(Education Code 44940)<br>
<br>
If an employee is charged with an offense that falls into both the mandatory and optional leave of absence definitions, the offense shall be treated as a mandatory leave of absence offense. &nbsp;(Education Code 44940)<br>
<br>
An employee&#39;s compulsory leave for a mandatory or optional leave of absence offense may extend for not more than 10 days after the entry of judgment in the criminal proceedings. However, the compulsory leave may be extended if the Board gives notice, within 10 days after the entry of judgment in the proceedings, that the employee will be dismissed within 30 days from the date of service of the notice unless a hearing is demanded. &nbsp;(Education Code 44940, 44940.5)<br>

If the employee is acquitted or the charges are dismissed, the district must reimburse the employee for the cost of the bond upon return to service in the district. If an employee who does not furnish a bond or other security is acquitted or the charges are dismissed, the district must pay the employee's salary for the time spent on leave upon return to service.<br><br>Education Code 44940.5 specifies that, if the charges against an employee are dismissed as a result of the employee's successful completion of a drug diversion program and the employee returns to service, the employee may elect to receive payment for any accrued leave and differential pay for the length of the employee's leave of absence.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="QNzcOA10" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22QNzcOA10%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22UNg903%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1710206802%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2044940.5%2C%20while%20on%20compulsory%20leave%2C%20the%20employee%27s%20salary%20may%20be%20paid%20if%20the%20employee%20provides%20a%20suitable%20bond%20or%20other%20acceptable%20security%20as%20a%20guarantee%20that%20the%20leave-period%20salary%20will%20be%20repaid%20if%20the%20employee%20is%20convicted%20of%20the%20charges%20or%20fails%20to%20return%20to%20district%20service.%20If%20the%20employee%20is%20acquitted%20or%20the%20charges%20are%20dismissed%2C%20the%20district%20must%20reimburse%20the%20employee%20for%20the%20cost%20of%20the%20bond%20upon%20return%20to%20service%20in%20the%20district.%20If%20an%20employee%20who%20does%20not%20furnish%20a%20bond%20or%20other%20security%20is%20acquitted%20or%20the%20charges%20are%20dismissed%2C%20the%20district%20must%20pay%20the%20employee%27s%20salary%20for%20the%20time%20spent%20on%20leave%20upon%20return%20to%20service.%5Cn%5CnEducation%20Code%2044940.5%20specifies%20that%2C%20if%20the%20charges%20against%20an%20employee%20are%20dismissed%20as%20a%20result%20of%20the%20employee%27s%20successful%20completion%20of%20a%20drug%20diversion%20program%20and%20the%20employee%20returns%20to%20service%2C%20the%20employee%20may%20elect%20to%20receive%20payment%20for%20any%20accrued%20leave%20and%20differential%20pay%20for%20the%20length%20of%20the%20employee%27s%20leave%20of%20absence.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-QNzcOA10" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44940.5, whi..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
