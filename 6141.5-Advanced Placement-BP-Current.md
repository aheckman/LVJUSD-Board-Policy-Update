## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that maintain high schools and may be revised to reflect district practice. Students who participate in Advanced Placement (AP) courses and pass AP examinations conducted by the College Board may receive college credit for those courses when allowed by the postsecondary institution. 
To encourage district students to challenge themselves academically, develop college-level skills, and be more competitive when applying for admission to postsecondary institutions, the Governing Board shall offer opportunities to high school students to take Advanced Placement (AP) courses and pass AP examinations.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be modified to reflect district practice. 
The Board desires to provide at least four AP courses at each high school. The Superintendent or designee shall recommend subject areas for AP courses at each school based on student interest and the availability of qualified certificated staff, instructional materials, and other resources. The Superintendent or designee shall also explore alternative methods of delivering AP courses, such as online courses or distance learning.

The Superintendent or designee may consult and collaborate with feeder schools to ensure that students are offered the opportunity to take coursework that will prepare them for AP courses.

All students who meet course prerequisites shall have equal access to AP courses.

Grades for AP courses shall be assigned in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation.

The Superintendent or designee shall make efforts to encourage students to participate in AP courses and to take end-of-course AP exams by creating support systems for AP students,such as resource centers and programs to recognize student accomplishments.  In addition, the Superintendent or designee may explore partnerships with colleges and universities to help encourage students to pursue postsecondary education.

To increase the capacity of district schools to offer AP courses, the Superintendent or designee shall provide staff development and support to teachers of such courses.  This professional development may include, but is not limited to, opportunities for teachers to obtain information on the curriculum of specific courses, instructional methods, and data-driven decision making; mentoring for prospective teachers of AP courses; and opportunities for staff within the district to share course syllabi and practices.

CSBA NOTE: The College Board has created a voluntary audit process to provide guidelines for administrators and AP teachers regarding the curricular and resource requirements of AP courses. The AP audit specifies a set of expectations established by college and university faculty for college-level courses. Courses that meet or exceed these expectations will be authorized to use the "AP" designation on students' transcripts. In addition, approved courses are listed in the AP Course Ledger, which is used by colleges to confirm high school course content. Schools that offer the AP exam without labeling the school's courses as AP on students' transcripts do not need to participate in the audit. The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that wish to participate in the AP audit. 
The Board desires that every district AP course receive authorization to use the AP designation by the College Board.  To that end, the Superintendent or designee shall coordinate the process for submitting courses for approval as part of the College Board AP course audit.

Examination Fee

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that receive federal funding distributed by the California Department of Education pursuant to 20 USC 6534, or choose to use district funds, to assist economically disadvantaged students in paying the cost of AP examination fees. Education Code 52244, which awarded state grants for this purpose, self-repealed on January 1, 2013, and the funding was redirected into the local control funding formula pursuant to AB 97 (Ch. 47, Statutes of 2013). 
To the extent feasible, the district shall reduce the cost of AP examination fees for eligible low-income students.  At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians of the availability of funds for this purpose and shall provide information on how income-eligible students may apply for funding.
