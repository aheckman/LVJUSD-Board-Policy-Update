## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice. Though employees have the same constitutional and statutory rights as other citizens, there are situations in which the district may limit some of those rights. In Johnson v. Poway Unified School District, the federal court of appeals found that a district's action controlling the speech of its employee when the employee posted two large banners that contained text which when taken out of context promoted a religious viewpoint did not violate the employee's First Amendment right when the speech occurred at work in the employee's role as a teacher.
The Governing Board believes that the personal life of an employee is not an appropriate concern of the district, except as it may directly relate to the performance of the employee's duties.

CSBA NOTE: When disciplining an employee, the district must ensure that all the surrounding facts and circumstances are considered and analyzed within the parameters of any applicable constitutional or legal framework. In Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the district violated the employee's protected free exercise and free speech rights when the district did not rehire the employee, a coach, for refusing to follow the district's direction to refrain from kneeling and praying at the 50-yard line immediately after each football game. The district's direction was based on a concern that the employee's prayer violated the district's religious practices policy and could subject the district to an Establishment Clause violation. Notwithstanding that the prayer occurred at a school event and in the presence of students, the court reasoned that the timing and circumstances indicated that the coach's prayers were offered as a private citizen rather than as a district employee. The Court held that since the prayer occurred during a break, a period when employees would ordinarily be free to engage in personal activities such as speaking with friends, checking email, calling for restaurant reservations, etc., the district's concerns about a possible Establishment Clause violation did not justify restricting the employee's free exercise and free speech rights to offer a private, personal prayer. Employee discipline, especially with respect to suspension and dismissal, involves complex legal considerations and districts are advised to consult CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or the district's legal counsel, accordingly.
District employees may engage in private, personal activities, including the exercise of their religious, political, cultural, social or other beliefs or activities, during personal time including when employees are not on duty or engaged in the supervision or instruction of students.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph provides for the right to privacy of district employees  pursuant to Article 1, Section 1 of the California Constitution. In addition, Education Code 49091.24 allows teachers the right to refuse to submit to district surveys or evaluations concerning certain personal beliefs as stated below.
The district shall make no inquiry concerning the personal values, attitudes, and beliefs of district employees or their sexual orientation or political or religious affiliations, beliefs, or opinions except when authorized by law.  In addition, no district employee shall be required to provide critical appraisals of other individuals with whom the employee has a familial relationship. However, the district reserves the right to access any publicly available information about any employee.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48907 gives students the right to exercise freedom of speech and of the press and mandates districts to adopt reasonable rules and regulations concerning the time, place, and manner for students to engage in those activities; see BP/AR 5145.2 - Freedom of Speech/Expression. In addition, Education Code 48950 prohibits a district from disciplining any high school student solely for the student's speech or other communication which would be protected by either the U.S. or California Constitution if engaged in outside of school campus. Both these provisions prohibit the disciplining of any employee who acts to protect a student engaged in any conduct authorized under these provisions.
No employee shall be dismissed, suspended, disciplined, reassigned, transferred, or otherwise retaliated against solely for acting to protect a student engaged in conduct authorized under Education Code 48907 or 48950.

CSBA NOTE: When investigating an allegation of employee misconduct, the district may need to consider whether a search of the employee's desk, files, or other district-provided equipment, such as a computer or cell phone, is warranted. The determination of whether a search is legally justified is complex and depends on whether the employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the items to be searched and whether the search is reasonable at its inception. Given the legal complexities, it is recommended that CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel be consulted prior to a search and that employees conducting searches receive appropriate instruction as to how the search is to be conducted.
When necessary to protect the health, welfare, or safety of students and staff, school officials may search district property under an employee's control.

Whistleblower Protection

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44110-44114, the Reporting by School Employees of Improper Governmental Activities Act, and Labor Code 1102.5 provide "whistleblower protection" to employees who refuse to be a party to, or who report, noncompliance with a state or federal law or regulation. This protection does not cover employees when they speak out within their employment setting on matters related to their official duties. In Garcetti v. Ceballos, the U.S. Supreme Court held that when public employees speak out in the workplace about work-related issues, they may be subject to employee discipline since they are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes. However, employees have the right to speak out as concerned citizens outside of the work environment. In addition, to the extent that the employee's speech is on an issue subject to whistleblower protection, then the protections provided to employees by the whistleblower statutes would be applicable.
An employee shall have the right to disclose to a Board member, a school administrator, a member of the County Board of Education, the County Superintendent of Schools, or the Superintendent of Public Instruction any improper governmental activity by the district or a district employee that violates state or federal law, is economically wasteful, or involves gross misconduct, incompetency, or inefficiency.  When the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute or a violation of or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation, the employee has the right to disclose such information to a government or law enforcement agency or to refuse to participate in any such activity.  (Education Code 44112, 44113; Labor Code 1102.5)

The Superintendent or designee shall prominently display in lettering larger than size 14 point type a list of employees' rights and responsibilities under the whistleblower laws, including the telephone number of the whistleblower hotline maintained by the office of the California Attorney General.  (Labor Code 1102.7, 1102.8)

No employee shall use or attempt to use official authority status or influence to intimidate, threaten, coerce, or command, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, coerce, or command, another employee for the purpose of interfering with that employee's right to disclose improper governmental activity.  (Education Code 44113)

CSBA NOTE: An employee may be liable for an action in civil damages for interfering with the right of another employee to disclose an improper governmental action. In Hartnett v. Crosier, a California appellate court ruled that "management employees" could also be held liable for their acts of retaliation committed when acting in a supervisory role.
An employee who has disclosed improper governmental activity and believes that acts or attempted acts of reprisal have subsequently occurred shall file a written complaint in accordance with the district's complaint procedures. After filing a complaint with the district, the employee may also file a copy of the complaint with local law enforcement and/or seek civil law remedies against the supervisor or administrator who retaliated or attempted to retaliate against the employee, in accordance with Education Code 44114.

Protection Against Liability

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 7941-7948 limit the liability of teachers, principals, and other school personnel who maintain discipline and/or ensure safety when harm is caused while they are acting within the scope of their employment. The law also applies to Governing Board members; see BB 9260 - Legal Protection. The following section is made applicable to all employees; however, any district that wishes to apply the section only to teachers should modify the section accordingly.
No employee shall be liable for harm caused by the employee's act or omission when acting within the scope of employment or district responsibilities, the employee's act or omission is in conformity with federal, state, and local laws, district policy, or administrative regulation, and the employee's act or omission is in furtherance of an effort to control, discipline, expel, or suspend a student or to maintain order or control in the classroom or school.  (20 USC 7946)

The protection against liability shall not apply when:  (20 USC 7946)

	The employee acted with willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, recklessness, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to rights or safety of the individual harmed.
	 
	The employee caused harm by operating a motor vehicle or other vehicle requiring license or insurance.
	 
	The employee was not properly licensed, if required, by state law for such activities.
	 
	The employee was found by a court to have violated a federal or state civil rights law.
	 
	The employee was under the influence of alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct.
	 
	The misconduct constituted a crime of violence pursuant to 18 USC 16 or an act of terrorism for which the employee has been convicted in a court.
	 
	The misconduct involved a sexual offense for which the employee has been convicted in a court.
	 
	The misconduct occurred during background investigations, or other actions, involved in the employee's hiring.

<strong>Whistleblower Protection</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='EMw741' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44110-44114, the Reporting by School Employees of Improper Governmental Activities Act, and Labor Code 1102.5 provide "whistleblower protection" to employees who refuse to be a party to, or who report, noncompliance with a state or federal law or regulation. This protection does not cover employees when they speak out within their employment setting on matters related to their official duties. In Garcetti v. Ceballos, the U.S. Supreme Court held that when public employees speak out in the workplace about work-related issues, they may be subject to employee discipline since they are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes. However, employees have the right to speak out as concerned citizens outside of the work environment. In addition, to the extent that the employee's speech is on an issue subject to whistleblower protection, then the protections provided to employees by the whistleblower statutes would be applicable.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="kOTMNQ5" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22kOTMNQ5%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22EMw741%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1663084112%2C%22text%22%3A%22Education%20Code%2044110-44114%2C%20the%20Reporting%20by%20School%20Employees%20of%20Improper%20Governmental%20Activities%20Act%2C%20and%20Labor%20Code%201102.5%20provide%20%5C%22whistleblower%20protection%5C%22%20to%20employees%20who%20refuse%20to%20be%20a%20party%20to%2C%20or%20who%20report%2C%20noncompliance%20with%20a%20state%20or%20federal%20law%20or%20regulation.%20This%20protection%20does%20not%20cover%20employees%20when%20they%20speak%20out%20within%20their%20employment%20setting%20on%20matters%20related%20to%20their%20official%20duties.%20In%20Garcetti%20v.%20Ceballos%2C%20the%20U.S.%20Supreme%20Court%20held%20that%20when%20public%20employees%20speak%20out%20in%20the%20workplace%20about%20work-related%20issues%2C%20they%20may%20be%20subject%20to%20employee%20discipline%20since%20they%20are%20not%20speaking%20as%20citizens%20for%20First%20Amendment%20purposes.%20However%2C%20employees%20have%20the%20right%20to%20speak%20out%20as%20concerned%20citizens%20outside%20of%20the%20work%20environment.%20In%20addition%2C%20to%20the%20extent%20that%20the%20employee%27s%20speech%20is%20on%20an%20issue%20subject%20to%20whistleblower%20protection%2C%20then%20the%20protections%20provided%20to%20employees%20by%20the%20whistleblower%20statutes%20would%20be%20applicable.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-kOTMNQ5" title="CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44110-44114, the Reporti..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
