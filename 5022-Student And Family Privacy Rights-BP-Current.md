## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 1232h, the Protection of Pupil Rights Act (PPRA), mandates that any district receiving funds from a program administered by the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) adopt a policy regarding the (1) administration of surveys and physical exams/screenings, (2) right of parents to inspect instructional materials, and (3) collection of personal information for marketing purposes. See the accompanying administrative regulation for additional requirements pertaining to these topics.
The Governing Board respects the rights of district students and their parents/guardians with regard to the privacy of their personal beliefs and the confidentiality of their personal information.

The Superintendent or designee may collect, disclose, or use students' personal information for the exclusive purpose of developing, evaluating, or providing educational products or services for or to students or educational institutions, such as the following:  (20 USC 1232h)

	College or other postsecondary education recruitment or military recruitment
	 
	Book clubs, magazines, and programs providing access to low-cost literary products
	 
	Curriculum and instructional materials used by elementary and secondary schools
	 
	Tests and assessments to provide cognitive, evaluative, diagnostic, clinical, aptitude, or achievement information about students (or to generate other statistically useful data for the purpose of securing such tests and assessments) and the subsequent analysis and public release of the aggregate data from such tests and assessments
	 
	The sale by students of products or services to raise funds for school-related or education-related activities
	 
	Student recognition programs

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 1232h mandates that districts adopt a policy concerning the collection, disclosure, or use of collected personal information for marketing purposes. Option 1 below is for use by districts that choose to prohibit the collection of personal information for marketing purposes. Option 2 is for use by districts that choose to authorize the collection of personal information purposes.
OPTION 1:

The Superintendent or designee is prohibited from collecting, disclosing, or using a student's individually identifiable information, including his/her name, parent/guardian's name, home or other physical address, telephone number, or social security number, for the purpose of marketing or selling that information or providing the information to others for that purpose.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:

CSBA NOTE: Although 20 USC 1232h authorizes the collection, disclosure, or use of students' personal information, including social security numbers, for the purpose of marketing or selling, Education Code 49076.7 prohibits the collection of social security numbers or the last four digits of social security numbers unless otherwise required to do so by state or federal law. The collection of personal information for marketing purposes is not required by law, and thus districts should not collect social security numbers or the last four digits of social security numbers for marketing purposes.In addition, pursuant to Education Code 234.7, as added by AB 699 (Ch. 493, Statutes of 2017), districts are prohibited from collecting information or documents regarding citizenship or immigration status of students or their families.
In addition, the Superintendent or designee may collect, disclose, or use a student's individually identifiable information, including his/her name, parent/guardian's name, home or other physical address, or telephone number for the purpose of marketing or selling that information or providing the information to others for that purpose.

However, the district shall not use surveys to collect social security numbers or the last four digits of social security numbers, or information or documents regarding citizenship or immigration status, of students or their families.  (Education Code 234.7, 49076.7)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this policy is for use by all districts.20 USC 1232h requires that the district's policy regarding student privacy be developed in consultation with parents/guardians. Such consultation could occur during meetings of the school site council or parent association or a separate committee could be convened to review the draft policy. The following paragraph may be modified to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall consult with parents/guardians regarding the development of regulations pertaining to other uses of personal information, which shall, at a minimum, address the following:  (20 USC 1232h)


	Arrangements for protecting student privacy when collecting, disclosing, or using students' individually identifiable information for any purpose
	 
	Arrangements to protect student privacy in the administration of surveys that may request information about the personal beliefs and practices of students and their families
	 
	The rights of parents/guardians to inspect the following, and any applicable procedures for granting reasonable access to the following in a reasonable period of time:
	 
	
		Survey instruments requesting information about their personal beliefs and practices or those of their children
		 
		Instructional materials used as part of their children's educational curriculum
		
		CSBA NOTE: Item #3c is for use only by districts that select Option 2 above.
		Instruments used in the collection of personal information for the purpose of marketing or sale
		 
	
	
	 Any nonemergency physical examinations or screenings that the school may administer

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 1232h mandates that the district's policy provide for reasonable notice to parents/guardians of the adoption or continued use of this policy. See the accompanying administrative regulation for additional requirements pertaining to the timing and content of such notice.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians of the adoption or continued use of the district's policy pertaining to the rights specified in items #1-4 above.  (20 USC 1232h)
