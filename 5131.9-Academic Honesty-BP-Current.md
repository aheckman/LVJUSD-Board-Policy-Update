## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board believes that academic honesty and personal integrity are fundamental components of a student's education and character development. The Board expects that students will not cheat, lie, plagiarize, or commit other acts of academic dishonesty.

Students, parents/guardians, staff, and administrators shall be responsible for creating and maintaining a positive school climate that encourages honesty. Students found to have committed an act of academic dishonesty shall be subject to district and school-site discipline rules.

The Superintendent or designee may establish a committee comprised of students, parents/guardians, staff, administrators, and members of the public to develop standards of academic honesty, measures of preventing dishonesty, and specific consequences for acts of dishonesty. Any recommendations for discipline shall be incorporated into the school's site level discipline rules.

Prohibited and Permitted Technology Use

CSBA NOTE: The following section addresses student use of technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), as it relates to academic honesty, and may be modified to reflect district practice. The U.S. Department of Education Office of Educational Technology's, "Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Teaching and Learning: Insights and Recommendations," provides information related to the opportunities for using AI to improve education, the challenges in doing so, and recommendations to guide further policy development. Districts are encouraged to continue to monitor the development of new technologies, including AI, and, as needed, consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel. For more information on student use of technology, see BP 6163.4 - Student Use of Technology.
As the district's standards for academic achievement are designed to challenge all students to reach their full potential in acquiring the knowledge and skills needed for success in postsecondary education, employment, and responsible citizenship, any use of technology that prevents or inhibits a student from achieving these standards is prohibited. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, using technology primarily or solely for the completion of coursework as a student's original work and generating answers to mathematical, scientific, or analytical problems.

Permitted uses of technology include, but are not limited to, conducting research, correcting grammar and spelling, and learning from educational applications such as tutoring systems and language learning applications.

Additionally, consistent with the limitations expressed in this policy and with teacher consent, students may also use technology to assist with assessments, homework, and/or makeup work or other uses approved by the teacher.

CSBA NOTE: A student who has been identified as a student with a disability may require assistive technology devices and services, including the use of AI. Pursuant to Education Code 56341.1, a student's Individualized Education Program team must consider whether a student with a disability needs assistive technology devices or services, defined in 20 USC 1401 as any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of a student with a disability. For more information regarding assistive technology for a student with a disability, see AR 6159 - Individualized Education Program.
However, a student with a disability shall be permitted to use technology for any purpose identified in the student's individualized education program as a tool to support the student's learning.

If an employee suspects that a student has used technology in violation of this policy, the student shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate that the use of technology was in accordance with this policy.

Any information acquired from an employee's use of technology in determining whether a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty shall be shared with the student, and the student's parent/guardian as appropriate.

The Superintendent or designee may provide training to staff regarding the use of technology to improve education, including the detection of plagiarism and sensitivity to potential discrimination from algorithmic bias.
