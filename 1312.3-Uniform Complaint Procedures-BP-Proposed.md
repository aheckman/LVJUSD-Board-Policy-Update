## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that the District has the primary responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations governing educational programs. The Board encourages the early resolution of complaints whenever possible. To resolve complaints which may require a more formal process, the Board adopts the uniform system of complaint processes specified in 5 CCR 4600-4670.

	However, the UCP shall not be used to investigate and resolve employment discrimination complaints.  (5 CCR 4611)
	 
	Educational and graduation requirements for students in foster care, students experiencing homelessness, students from military families, students formerly in a juvenile court school, students who are migratory, and newcomer students  (Education Code 48645.7, 48850, 48853, 48853.5, 48911, 48915.5, 49069.5, 51225.1, 51225.2)

The Board recognizes that alternative dispute resolution (ADR) can, depending on the nature of the allegations, offer a process for resolving a complaint in a manner that is acceptable to all parties. An ADR process such as mediation may be offered to resolve complaints that involve more than one student and no adult. However, mediation shall not be offered or used to resolve any complaint involving sexual assault or where there is a reasonable risk that a party to the mediation would feel compelled to participate. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the use of ADR is consistent with state and federal laws and regulations.

The District shall protect all complainants from retaliation. In investigating complaints, the confidentiality of the parties involved shall be protected as required by law. For any complaint alleging retaliation or unlawful discrimination, the Superintendent or designee shall keep the identity of the complainant, and/or the subject of the complaint if different from the complainant, confidential when appropriate and as long as the integrity of the complaint process is maintained.

When an allegation that is not subject to UCP is included in a UCP complaint, the District shall refer the non-UCP allegation to the appropriate staff or agency and shall investigate and, if appropriate, resolve the UCP-related allegation(s) through the District's UCP.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to District staff to ensure awareness and knowledge of current law and requirements related to UCP, including the steps and timelines specified in this policy and the accompanying administrative regulation.

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain a record of each complaint and subsequent related actions, including steps taken during the investigation and all information required for compliance with 5 CCR 4631 and 4633.

Non-UCP Complaints

The following complaints shall not be subject to the District's UCP but shall be investigated and resolved by the specified agency or through an alternative process:

	Any complaint alleging child abuse or neglect shall be referred to the County Department of Social Services Protective Services Division or the appropriate law enforcement agency  (5 CCR 4611)
	 
	Any complaint alleging health and safety violations by a child development program shall, for licensed facilities, be referred to Department of Social Services  (5 CCR 4611)
	 
	Any complaint alleging that a student, while in an education program or activity, was subjected to sexual harassment, as defined in 34 CFR 106.30
	
	Such a complaint shall be addressed through the federal Title IX complaint procedures as specified in Administrative Regulation 5145.71 - Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures.
	 
	Any complaint alleging employment discrimination or harassment shall be investigated and resolved by the District in accordance with the procedures specified in Administrative Regulation 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment, including the right to file the complaint with the California Civil Rights Department
	 
	Any complaint alleging a violation of a state or federal law or regulation related to special education, a settlement agreement related to the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE), failure or refusal to implement a due process hearing order to which the District is subject, or a physical safety concern that interferes with the District's provision of FAPE shall be submitted to the California Department of Education (CDE) in accordance with Administrative Regulation 6159.1 - Procedural Safeguards and Complaints for Special Education  (5 CCR 3200-3205)
	 
	Any complaint alleging noncompliance of the District's food service program with laws regarding meal counting and claiming, reimbursable meals, eligibility of children or adults, or use of cafeteria funds and allowable expenses shall be filed with or referred to CDE in accordance with Board Policy 3555 - Nutrition Program Compliance  (5 CCR 15580-15584)
	 
	Any complaint alleging discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability in the District's food service program shall be filed with or referred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in accordance with Board Policy 3555 - Nutrition Program Compliance  (5 CCR 15582)
	 
	Any complaint related to sufficiency of textbooks or instructional materials, emergency or urgent facilities conditions that pose a threat to the health or safety of students or staff, or teacher vacancies and misassignments shall be investigated and resolved in accordance with Administrative Regulation 1312.4 - Williams Uniform Complaint Procedures  (Education Code 35186)
