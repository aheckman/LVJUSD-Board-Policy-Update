## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes its responsibility to inform parents/guardians and the community about the conditions, needs, and progress at each District school and to provide data by which parents/guardians can make meaningful comparisons between schools. The process of gathering and analyzing data also provides opportunities for school and District staff to review achievements and identify areas for improvement.

The Board shall annually issue a school accountability report card (SARC) for each school site.  (Education Code 35256)

In preparing the District's report cards, the Superintendent or designee may choose to use or adapt the model template provided by the California Department of Education. If the model template is not used, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that data is reported in a manner that is consistent with the definitions for school conditions as provided in the template. At least every three years, the Board shall compare the content of the District's SARCs to the state's model template, recognizing that variances are allowed by law as necessary to meet local needs.  (Education Code 33126.1, 35256)

The Board shall annually approve the SARCs for all District schools and shall evaluate the data contained in the SARCs as part of the Board's regular review of the effectiveness of the District's programs, personnel, and fiscal operations.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for communicating the information contained in the SARCs to all stakeholders, including opportunities for staff and the community to discuss their content.

Notification and Dissemination of SARCs

Annually, on or before February 1 of each year, the Superintendent or designee shall publicize the issuance of the SARCs, make the SARCs available on the District's website, and notify parents/guardians that a hard copy shall be provided upon request.  (Education Code 33126, 35256, 35258)

Additionally, when 15 percent or more of a school's students speak a single primary language other than English, the SARC shall be translated into that other language.  (Education Code 48985)

In addition, the SARC shall be provided in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, provided in a language that parents/guardians can understand.  (Education Code 33126, 35256; 20 USC 6311)
