## Policy Content

I,  ____________________________________________________________, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.

I understand that as a public employee I am a disaster service worker pursuant to Government Code 3100 and 3102 and that I am required to take this oath before entering the duties of my employment.  In the event of natural, manmade or war-caused emergencies which result in conditions of disaster or extreme peril to life, property and resources, I am subject to disaster services activities assigned to me by my supervisor.
