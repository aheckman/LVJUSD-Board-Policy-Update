Reasonable suspicion means that it is objectively reasonable for a person to entertain a suspicion, based upon facts that could cause a reasonable person in a like position, drawing when appropriate on the person's training and experience, to suspect child abuse or neglect.  However, reasonable suspicion does not require certainty that child abuse or neglect has occurred nor does it require a specific medical indication of child abuse or neglect.  (Penal Code 11166)

Reportable Offenses

A mandated reporter shall make a report using the procedures provided below whenever, acting in a professional capacity or within the scope of employment, the mandated reporter has knowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect.  (Penal Code 11166)

Any mandated reporter who has knowledge of or who reasonably suspects that a child is suffering serious emotional damage or is at a substantial risk of suffering serious emotional damage, based on evidence of severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or untoward aggressive behavior toward self or others, may make a report to the appropriate agency.  (Penal Code 11165.9, 11166.05, 11167)

Any District employee who reasonably believes to have observed the commission of a murder, rape, or lewd or lascivious act by use of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury against a victim who is a child under age 14 shall notify a peace officer.  (Penal Code 152.3, 288)

Responsibility for Reporting

	The principal so notified shall provide the mandated reporter with any assistance necessary to ensure that reporting procedures are carried out in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation. At the mandated reporter's request, the principal may assist in completing and filing the necessary forms.

Training

Within the first six weeks of each school year, or within the first six weeks of employment if hired during the school year, the Superintendent or designee shall provide training on mandated reporting requirements to District employees and persons working on their behalf who are mandated reporters.  (Education Code 44691; Penal Code 11165.7)

Victim Interviews by Social Services

Whenever CDSS or another government agency is investigating suspected child abuse or neglect that occurred within the child's home or out-of-home care facility, the student may be interviewed by an agency representative during school hours, on school premises. The Superintendent or designee shall give the student the choice of being interviewed in private or in the presence of any adult school employee or volunteer aide selected by the student.  (Penal Code 11174.3)

A staff member or volunteer aide selected by a child may decline to be present at the interview. If the selected person accepts, the principal or designee shall inform the person of the following requirements prior to the interview:  (Penal Code 11174.3)

Release of Child to Peace Officer

When a child is released to a peace officer and taken into custody as a victim of suspected child abuse or neglect, the Superintendent or designee and/or principal shall not notify the parent/guardian, but rather shall provide the peace officer with the address and telephone number of the child's parent/guardian.  (Education Code 48906)

Parent/Guardian Complaints

Upon request, the Superintendent or designee shall provide parents/guardians with procedures for reporting suspected child abuse occurring at a school site to appropriate agencies.  For parents/guardians whose primary language is not English, such procedures shall be in their primary language and, when communicating orally regarding those guidelines and/or procedures, an interpreter shall be provided.

To file a complaint against a District employee or other person suspected of child abuse or neglect at a school site, parents/guardians may file a report by telephone, in person, or in writing with any appropriate agency identified above under "Reporting Procedures." If a parent/guardian makes a complaint about an employee to any other employee, the employee receiving the information shall notify the parent/guardian of procedures for filing a complaint with the appropriate agency.  The employee shall also file a report when obligated to do so pursuant to Penal Code 11166 using the procedures described above for mandated reporters.

In addition, if the child is enrolled in special education, a separate complaint may be filed with the California Department of Education pursuant to 5 CCR 3200-3205.

Notifications

The Superintendent or designee shall provide to all new employees who are mandated reporters a statement that informs them of their status as mandated reporters, their reporting obligations under Penal Code 11166, and their confidentiality rights under Penal Code 11167.  The District also shall provide these new employees with a copy of Penal Code 11165.7, 11166, and 11167.  (Penal Code 11165.7, 11166.5)

Before beginning employment, any person who will be a mandated reporter by virtue of the person's position shall sign a statement indicating knowledge of the reporting obligations under Penal Code 11166 and compliance with such provisions.  The signed statement shall be retained by the Superintendent or designee.  (Penal Code 11166.5)

The Superintendent or designee also shall notify all employees that:

	A mandated reporter who reports a known or suspected instance of child abuse or neglect shall not be held civilly or criminally liable for making a report and this immunity shall apply even if the mandated reporter acquired the knowledge or reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect outside of the mandated reporter's professional capacity or outside the scope of employment. Any other person making a report shall not incur civil or criminal liability unless it can be proven that the person knowingly made a false report or made a report with reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the report.  (Penal Code 11172)
	 
	If a mandated reporter fails to timely report an incident of known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect, the mandated reporter may be guilty of a crime punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment.  (Penal Code 11166)
