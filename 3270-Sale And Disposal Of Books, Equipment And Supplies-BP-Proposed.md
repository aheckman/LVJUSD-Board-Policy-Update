## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes its fiscal responsibility to maximize the use of District equipment, supplies, instructional materials, and other personal property while providing up-to-date resources that facilitate student learning and effective District operations. When the Board, upon recommendation of the Superintendent or designee, declares any District-owned personal property unusable, obsolete, or no longer needed, the Board shall determine the estimated value of the property and shall decide whether the property will be donated, sold, or otherwise disposed of as prescribed by law and administrative regulation.

The Board shall approve the price and terms of any sale or lease of personal property of the District.

If the Board members who are in attendance at a meeting unanimously agree that the property, whether one or more items, does not exceed $2,500 in value, the property may be sold without advertising for bids.  (Education Code 17546)

If the Board members who are in attendance at a meeting unanimously find that the value of the property is insufficient to defray the costs of arranging a sale, the property may be donated to a charitable organization deemed appropriate by the Board or may be disposed of in the local public dump.  (Education Code 17546)

Instructional materials shall be considered obsolete or unusable by the District if they have been replaced by more recent editions or new materials selected by the Board, are not aligned with the District's academic standards or course of study, and have no foreseeable value in other instructional areas. Such materials may be sold or donated if they continue to serve educational purposes that would benefit others outside the District. Instructional materials are not appropriate for sale or donation if they meet any of the following criteria:


	Contain information rendered inaccurate or incomplete by new research or technologies
	 
	Contain demeaning, stereotyping, or patronizing references to any group of persons protected against discrimination by law or Board policy
	 
	Are damaged beyond use or repair

The Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures to be used whenever the District sells equipment or supplies originally acquired under a federal grant or subgrant. Such procedures shall be designed to ensure the highest possible return.  (2 CFR 200.313)
