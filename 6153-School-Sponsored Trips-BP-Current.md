## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy should be revised to reflect district practice. For language regarding transportation for field trips, see AR 3541.1 - Transportation for School-Related Trips.
The Governing Board recognizes that field trips supplement and enrich the classroom learning experience, lead to increased student achievement, and foster student engagement. The Board encourages field trips to reinforce and increase learning opportunities and to enhance district programs.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is consistent with the goals of field trips and excursions specified in Education Code 35330. Districts that wish to prohibit certain types of trips (e.g., trips to amusement parks, boating) because of educational or safety concerns may modify the following paragraph accordingly.
Field trips shall be conducted in connection with the district's course of study or school-related social, educational, cultural, athletic, school band, or other extracurricular or cocurricular activities.  A field trip to a foreign country may be permitted to familiarize students with the language, history, geography, natural science, and other studies relative to the district's course of study.  (Education Code 35330)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
Requests for field trips involving out-of-state, out-of-country, or overnight travel shall be submitted to the Superintendent or designee. The Superintendent or designee shall review the request and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether the request should be approved by the Board. All other field trips shall be approved in advance by the principal.

The principal shall establish a process for approving a staff member's request to conduct a field trip.  When planning trips, staff shall consider student safety, objectives of instruction, the most effective use of instructional time, the distance from school, district and student expense, and transportation and supervision requirements.  Principals may exclude from the trip any student whose presence on the trip would pose a safety or disciplinary risk.

No field trip shall be authorized if any student would be excluded from participation because of a lack of sufficient funds.  The Superintendent or designee shall coordinate with community groups to supply funds for students in need.  (Education Code 35330)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35330, as amended by AB 341 (Ch. 40, Statutes of 2017), eliminates the prohibition against the use of district funds to pay for the expenses of students participating in field trips or excursions to another state, to the District of Columbia, or to a foreign country. Pursuant to Education Code 35330, unlike field trips within the state, no transportation allowances will be made by the Superintendent of Public Instruction for out-of-state field trips.
The Board may approve the use of district funds for student expenses for in-state, out-of-state, or out-of-country field trips or excursions when permitted by law. In addition, expenses of instructors, chaperones, and other personnel participating in such trips, as well as incidental expenses for the use of district equipment during the trip, may be paid from district funds.  (Education Code 35330)
