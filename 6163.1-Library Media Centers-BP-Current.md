## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 18100 requires the Governing Board to provide library services for students and teachers by maintaining school libraries or contracting with another public agency. The following optional policy is intended for use by districts that maintain their own school libraries, but may be modified to meet the needs of districts that enter into an arrangement to receive services from either a county or city library pursuant to Education Code 18130 or 18134; also see BP 1330.1 - Joint Use Agreements.The State Board of Education (SBE) has adopted model program standards for school libraries which describe (1) school library standards for students that delineate what students should know and be able to do at each grade level (see section "Library Instruction," below), and (2) school library program standards that describe staffing, access, resources, and infrastructure, including technology, recommended for effective school library programs. The following policy may be modified to reflect state program standards that the district chooses to implement.
The Governing Board recognizes that school libraries support the educational program by providing access to a variety of informational and supplemental resources that can inspire a love of reading, stimulate thought, the exploration of ideas and intellectual exchanges, and contribute to the academic achievement of all students. The Board desires that school libraries be stocked with up-to-date books, reference materials, and electronic resources that promote literacy, support academic standards, contain a broad spectrum of knowledge and viewpoints, accurately reflect and value society's diversity, and prepare students to become lifelong learners.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee may, in consultation with teacher librarians, classroom teachers, administrators, parents/guardians, and students as appropriate, develop and regularly update a plan for school libraries that describes the district's goals for school libraries and the distribution of funds to school sites to support libraries. As appropriate, the plan may also address staffing, facilities, selection and evaluation of materials, the development and maintenance of classroom libraries, prevention of loss or damage of library materials, prioritization of needs, and other related matters. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the library plan is aligned with the district's local control and accountability plan and other district and school plans.

Staffing

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 18120, the Board may appoint one or more librarians to staff school libraries, provided they possess an appropriate credential issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) as required by Education Code 44868 and 5 CCR 80053. This may include a teacher librarian services credential issued since January 1, 2008 or a library media teacher services credential issued prior to that date. In addition, 5 CCR 80024.6 establishes requirements for an emergency teacher librarian services permit that may be issued when there is an insufficient number of qualified certificated persons to fill available positions.SBE model program standards recommend a ratio of one full-time teacher librarian per 785 students, plus assignment of a classified paraprofessional (e.g., library technician, library aide) at least 34 hours per week.If the district does not employ any teacher librarians, it should modify this policy to reflect the position(s) that are assigned to fulfill the related duties.
To staff school libraries, the district may employ one or more teacher librarians who possess appropriate credentials issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.  (Education Code 18120, 44868; 5 CCR 80024.6, 80053)

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 80053 specifies the duties that any teacher librarian who possesses an appropriate credential or emergency permit from the CTC is authorized to perform. 5 CCR 80053.1 establishes a special class authorization which authorizes the holder to provide departmentalized instruction in information literacy, digital literacy, and digital citizenship. The district may revise Items #1-8 below to reflect the duties of teacher librarians included in district job descriptions.
The Superintendent or designee may assign teacher librarians to perform the following duties in accordance with the authorizations of their credential:  (5 CCR 80053, 80053.1)

	Instruct students in accessing, evaluating, using, and integrating information and resources in the library program and/or provide departmentalized instruction in information literacy, digital literacy, and digital citizenship
	 
	Plan and coordinate school library programs with the district's instructional programs through collaboration with teachers
	 
	Select materials for school and district libraries
	 
	Develop and deliver staff development programs for school library services
	 
	Coordinate or supervise library programs at the school or district level
	 
	Plan and conduct a course of instruction for students who assist in the operation of school libraries
	 
	Supervise classified personnel assigned school library duties
	 
	Develop procedures for and management of the school and district libraries

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 35021, the district may not use volunteer aides in lieu of classified employees whose positions were abolished.
The Board also may appoint classified paraprofessionals to serve as library aides or library technicians. Volunteers may assist with school library services in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.

Hours of Operation

School libraries shall be open for use by students and teachers during the school day.  (Education Code 18103)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional.
With the approval of the Board, a school library may be open at other hours outside the school day, including evenings and Saturdays. Any library open to serve students during evening and Saturday hours shall be under the supervision of a certificated employee who consents to the assignment.  (Education Code 18103)

Selection and Evaluation of School Library Materials

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice. At its discretion, the Board may establish selection criteria that exclude all materials of a sectarian, partisan, or denominational character as authorized by Education Code 18111.
Library materials shall include print and electronic resources that align with the curriculum and are accessible to students with varying cognitive and/or language needs.

Library materials shall be selected and evaluated through a process that invites recommendations from administrators, teachers, other staff, parents/guardians, and students as appropriate.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 243, as added by AB 1078 (Ch. 229, Statutes of 2023), clarifies when it is unlawful discrimination for the Board to (1) refuse to approve the use of any book or other resource in a school library or (2) prohibit the use of any book or other resource in a school library. The Board may not refuse to approve the use of any book or other resource in a school library on the basis that the material includes a study of the role and contributions of specified individuals or groups, unless the study of the role and contributions reflects adversely upon legally protected groups. Additionally, the Board may not prohibit the use of any book or other resource in a school library on the basis that the study of the role and contributions contain inclusive or diverse perspectives.For more information, the California Department of Education's (CDE) website provides guidance on the removal of instruction or instructional materials. In addition, Education Code 60040.5, as added by AB 1078 (2023), requires CDE to issue, no later than July 1, 2025, guidance regarding how to review instructional materials to ensure that they represent diverse perspectives and are culturally relevant. Additionally, Education Code 242, as added by AB 1078, requires CDE to develop, by July 1, 2025, guidance and public educational materials to ensure that all Californians can access information about educational laws and policies that safeguard the right to an accurate and inclusive curriculum.
The use of any book or other resource in a school library shall not be rejected or prohibited by the Board or district on the basis that it includes a study of the role and contributions of any individual or group consistent with the requirements of Education Code 51204.5 and 60040, unless such study would violate Education Code 51501 or 60044.  (Education Code 243)

Library materials shall be continually evaluated in relation to evolving curricula, new formats of materials, new instructional methods, and the needs of students and teachers. Materials that contain outdated subject matter or are no longer appropriate shall be removed.

All gifts and donations of school library materials shall be subject to the same criteria as materials selected for purchase by the district.

CSBA NOTE: Complaints alleging discrimination based on a violation of Education Code 243, as added by AB 1078, related to the use or prohibited use of any book or other resource in a school library as described above, may be brought under the district's uniform complaint procedures or may be filed directly with the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI). Complaints that are filed directly with the SPI are required to identify the basis for doing so, and present evidence that supports the basis for the direct filing. In such cases, the SPI may directly intervene without waiting for an investigation by the district. See BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.
Complaints regarding the appropriateness of library materials shall be addressed in accordance with Board Policy 1312.2 - Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials and Board Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, as applicable.

Fees

Students shall be allowed to borrow school library materials at no charge for use in the library and classrooms as well as out of school.  (5 CCR 16042)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 16042, the district shall not charge students for the late return of library materials unless authorized to do so by the Board. The district should select the option below that reflects district practice. Option 2 may be modified to include the amount that will be charged.
OPTION 1:  (No late fees)
Students shall be encouraged to return library materials in a timely manner, but no charge shall be assessed for the late return of materials.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Late fees charged)
To encourage students to return materials in a timely manner, a nominal fee shall be charged for the late return of materials.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

Library Instruction

CSBA NOTE: In September 2010, SBE adopted model academic standards for library instruction which address what students should know and be able to do at each grade level or grade span in terms of information literacy skills. The introduction to the standards expresses the intent that the standards be taught collaboratively by the classroom teacher and the teacher librarian within the context of the curriculum. The following optional section reflects the four major categories addressed in the state standards and may be revised to reflect district practice.SBE has also developed a document identifying examples of where the library instruction standards are aligned with Common Core State Standards. See CDE's website.
Teacher librarians and/or classroom teachers shall provide library instruction to support the development of students' information literacy skills. Such instruction shall be aligned with the state academic standards for library instruction and shall prepare students to:

	Access information by applying knowledge of the organization of libraries, print materials, digital media, and other sources
	 
	Evaluate and analyze information to determine appropriateness in addressing the scope of inquiry
	 
	Organize, synthesize, create, and communicate information
	 
	Integrate information literacy skills into all areas of learning and pursue information independently to become life-long learners

Teacher librarians also may provide support to teachers, administrators, and other staff by identifying instructional materials that will aid in the development of curriculum and instructional activities and by providing information about effective and ethical uses of school library services and equipment.

Program Evaluation

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice. The district may use an assessment tool such as the CDE's, "Looking at the School Library: An Evaluation Tool," or may develop its own program evaluation indicators or checklist.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually assess and report to the Board regarding the condition and use of school libraries. The assessment shall evaluate, at a minimum:

	Access of students and staff to school libraries during school hours and, as appropriate, access outside the school day
	 
	The process and frequency by which students are allowed to check out library materials
	 
	Staffing levels, qualifications, and number of hours worked
	 
	The quality of the collection at each library, including, but not limited to, the total number of books in the collection, number of books per student, types of materials (fiction, non-fiction, newspapers, magazines, encyclopedias, materials in other languages, and reference materials), alignment with curriculum, provision of a broad spectrum of knowledge and viewpoints, amount expended during the year for the purchase of new resources, and the number of resources discarded and added during the year
	 
	Any special programs offered at the school to encourage reading and/or library use
	 
	The adequacy of the facility space and equipment designated for the school library
	 
	The source(s) and adequacy of funding for school libraries
	 
	Knowledge by principals, teachers, and library personnel of the process to follow when a library material(s) is challenged

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 18122 requires districts to annually report to CDE on the condition of district school libraries. This survey is conducted online via CDE's website.
The district shall, on or before August 31 each year, report to the California Department of Education on the condition of its school libraries for the preceding year ending June 30.  (Education Code 18122)
