## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44984 and 45192 mandate that the Governing Board adopt rules and regulations providing industrial accident and illness leave for certificated and classified employees.  The following regulation is subject to collective bargaining agreements.For information about employees' rights related to workers' compensation benefits for industrial accidents or illnesses, see BP 4157.1/4257.1/4357.1 - Work-Related Injuries.
An eligible employee shall be entitled to a leave of absence for an industrial accident or illness arising in the course of his/her assigned duties.  (Education Code 44984, 45192)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44984 and 45192 mandate that district rules and regulations specify the amount of allowable leave as provided in the following paragraph.  The district should fill in the blank in the following paragraph to specify the maximum amount of leave allowed by the district which, pursuant to Education Code 44984 and 45192, must not be less than 60 working days in any one fiscal year for the same industrial accident or illness.  In the absence of district rules and regulations, employees shall be entitled to industrial accident or illness leave, but without limitation as to the number of days of such leave.
For such leave, the employee shall be granted no more than _________ working days in any one fiscal year for the same industrial accident or illness.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44984 and 45192 mandate that district rules and regulations include the provisions in the following paragraph and items #1-4.
To be eligible for industrial accident or illness leave, a classified employee shall have served in the district continuously for at least three years.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44984 and 45192 mandate that district rules and regulations include the provisions in the following paragraph and items #1-4.
Allowable industrial accident or illness leave shall not be accumulated from year to year.  (Education Code 44984, 45192)

When an employee is absent from his/her duties because of an industrial accident or illness:  (Education Code 44043, 44044, 44984, 45192)

	The leave shall start on the first day of absence.
	 
	During the period of absence, the employee shall be paid such portion of his/her wage or salary that, when added to the award granted under state workers' compensation laws, will not exceed his/her normal wage or salary.
	 
	The leave shall be reduced by one day for each day of authorized absence, regardless of an award granted under workers' compensation laws.
	 
	When the leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the employee is entitled to only the amount of unused leave due the employee for the same illness or injury.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44043, a certificated or classified employee who uses a paid leave of absence while receiving temporary disability benefits under state workers' compensation laws must endorse his/her workers' compensation check payable to the district, and the district shall then issue a salary warrant to the employee after deducting retirement contributions and other appropriate deductions (see Option 1 below).  However, Education Code 44044 authorizes the district to waive this requirement, thereby allowing an employee to retain the workers' compensation check and receive a salary payment from the district with the equivalent amount of the workers' compensation check deducted (see Option 2 below).
OPTION 1:  During any paid leave of absence, the employee shall endorse to the district any workers' compensation checks received on account of an industrial accident or illness. The Superintendent or designee shall then issue payment of the employee's normal wage or salary less any appropriate deductions, including, but not limited to, employee retirement contributions.  (Education Code 44043)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  During any paid leave of absence, the employee shall retain any workers' compensation check received on account of an industrial accident or illness. The employee shall notify the Superintendent or designee that he/she has received such check. The Superintendent or designee shall then issue payment of the employee's normal wage or salary less an amount equivalent to the face amount of the workers' compensation check and other appropriate deductions, including, but not limited to, employee retirement contributions. Employee benefits shall be computed on the basis of the employee's regular wage or salary prior to the deduction of any amounts for temporary disability payments. (Education Code 44044)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this regulation applies to all districts.
Absence for industrial accident or illness shall not be considered a break in service of the employee. An employee using such leave shall retain all status and benefits to which he/she would otherwise be entitled.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 45192 requires the district to notify classified employees in writing when their industrial accident or illness leave has been exhausted and to offer them an opportunity to request additional leave.  Education Code 44984 authorizes certificated employees to use personal illness and injury leave upon expiration of the industrial accident or illness leave, but does not specifically require notification of the employee. The following paragraph extends this notification to all employees and should be revised by districts that choose to limit such notification to classified employees. If the district chooses to limit these provisions to classified employees, it is recommended that the district consult legal counsel regarding potential legal risks.
When available industrial accident or illness leave has been exhausted, the employee shall be so notified in writing and shall be offered an opportunity to request any additional paid or unpaid leave available to the employee.  (Education Code 45192)

Upon expiration of allowable leave for an industrial accident or illness, the employee may use personal illness and injury leave provided pursuant to Education Code 44977, 44978, 44983, or 45191, as applicable, provided that such leave, when added to any continuing workers' compensation award, does not result in a payment to the employee of more than his/her full wage or salary.  (Education Code 44984, 45192)

If a certificated employee is unable to resume the duties of his/her position after exhausting all accumulated sick leave, including the consecutive five-month period provided by Education Code 44977, he/she shall, if not placed in another position, be placed on a reemployment list for a period of 24 months if he/she is a probationary employee or 39 months if he/she is a permanent employee. If the employee becomes medically able to resume duties during the period of reemployment eligibility, he/she shall be returned to employment in a position for which he/she is credentialed and qualified.  (Education Code 44978.1)

CSBA NOTE: While the Education Code allows probationary certificated employees to be placed on a 24-month reemployment list, there is no equivalent 24-month reemployment list for probationary classified employees.  Pursuant to Education Code 45192, all classified employees, whether permanent or probationary, are placed on a 39-month reemployment list.
If a classified employee has exhausted all available leaves of absence, paid or unpaid, and is not medically able to resume the duties of his/her position, he/she shall, if not placed in another position, be placed on a reemployment list for a period of 39 months. If he/she becomes medically able to resume duties during the period of reemployment eligibility, he/she shall be employed in a vacant position in the class of his/her previous assignment over all other candidates except those on a reemployment list established because of lack of work or lack of funds, in which case the employee shall be listed in accordance with seniority regulations.  If the employee is medically released to return to duty but fails to accept an appropriate assignment, he/she shall be dismissed.  (Education Code 45192)
