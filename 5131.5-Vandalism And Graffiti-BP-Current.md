## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be modified to reflect district practice. Strategies regarding graffiti prevention and removal may be included as part of a school's comprehensive safety plan (see BP/AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan), campus security procedures (see BP/AR 3515 - Campus Security), or gang prevention techniques (see BP/AR 5136 - Gangs). Government Code 53069.5 authorizes districts to create a reward program to encourage the identification of individuals who have committed vandalism (see BP/AR 3515.4 - Recovery for Property Loss or Damage).
The Governing Board desires to enhance student learning by striving to provide an environment where students and staff can feel safe and secure and can take pride in their school.  To that end, the Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for preventing graffiti and vandalism on school grounds, including collaborating with local law enforcement and city and county officials, as appropriate, to help develop a coordinated response to graffiti and vandalism in the community. 

CSBA NOTE: Certain acts of graffiti or vandalism may trigger the need for an investigation pursuant to the district's sexual harassment or nondiscrimination grievance procedures (e.g., graffiti that is sexual in nature or disparaging to a class of individuals protected by the district's nondiscrimination policies)
Students and staff are encouraged to report any graffiti or vandalism to the principal or designee for investigation.  The principal or designee shall determine whether the incident necessitates an investigation pursuant to the district's sexual harassment, hate-motivated behavior, or nondiscrimination grievance procedure.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Penal Code 594.1, any person who commits vandalism, defaces property with graffiti, or possesses certain tools or objects (e.g., spray paint cans, markers) with the intent to commit vandalism or deface property with graffiti may be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine and/or community service. Other local laws may apply since many cities and counties have adopted ordinances prohibiting vandalism and graffiti within their boundaries. In addition, some types of graffiti or vandalism may be evidence of a hate crime.
As appropriate, the principal or designee may contact local law enforcement in instances when the graffiti is repetitive, identifies particular targets or groups, identifies the perpetrator, and/or contains incitements to violence, threats, or intimidation.  Photographs or other evidence of the vandalism or graffiti shall be preserved as necessary for investigation by the district or law enforcement and as evidence in any district disciplinary proceedings.

The principal or designee shall ensure that graffiti on school grounds is removed and covered as soon as possible, and if practicable before the beginning of the school day. 

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48904 and Civil Code 1714.1 specify that a parent/guardian may be liable for damages to school property resulting from the willful misconduct of his/her minor child; see BP/AR 3515.4 - Recovery for Property Loss or Damage.
A student who commits an act of vandalism or graffiti on school grounds shall be subject to disciplinary action, including, but not limited to, suspension or expulsion in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation. If reparation for damages is not made, the district also may withhold the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts in accordance with law.
