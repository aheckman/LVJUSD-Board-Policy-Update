## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that classified personnel provide essential services that support and enhance the District's educational program. The Board shall fill each of its classified positions with qualified persons, consistent with position requirements.

The Board shall classify all employees and positions not requiring certification qualifications as the classified service, except for those employees and positions specifically exempt from classified service.  (Education Code 45103)

Individuals who possess certification qualifications shall not be prohibited from being employed in a classified position.  (Education Code 45104)

Each classified position shall have a designated title and regular minimum number of assigned hours per day, days per week, and months per year.

Classified employees shall be assigned by their immediate supervisors with the approval of the Superintendent or designee. They shall be required to perform those duties prescribed by the Board for the position the employee holds, in accordance with applicable job descriptions and collective bargaining agreements.

Each classified employee shall be held accountable for duties assigned to him/her and shall undergo regular performance evaluations in accordance with collective bargaining agreements.

Substitute and Short-Term Employees

The District may employ a substitute employee to replace a classified employee who is temporarily absent from duty.  (Education Code 45103)

If the District is in the process of hiring a permanent employee to fill a classified position, the Board may fill the vacancy with one or more substitute employees for no more than 60 calendar days, unless the applicable collective bargaining agreement provides for a different period of time.  (Education Code 45103)

The District may employ a short-term employee to perform a service for the District when that service or similar services will not be extended or needed on a continuing basis. Before employing a short-term employee, the Board, at a regularly scheduled meeting, shall specify the service required to be performed by the employee and shall certify the ending date of the service.  The Board may shorten or extend the ending date, but the date shall not be extended beyond 195 work days per year, including holidays, sick leave, vacation, and other leaves of absence, irrespective of the number of hours worked per day.  (Education Code 45103)
