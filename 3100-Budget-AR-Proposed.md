Budget Advisory Committee

Membership of the District's budget advisory committee may include representatives of each of the following groups:


	One Board Member assigned through the annual Board of Education Memberships/Assignments process 
	 
	District staff
	 
	Representatives of each bargaining unit
	 
	Members of the community including parents/guardians 

The committee's duties may include, but are not necessarily limited to:


	Making recommendations regarding budget priorities which align with the District's vision, goals, priorities, local control and accountability plan (LCAP), and other comprehensive plans
	 
	Recommending cost reduction strategies, such as identifying services that may be reduced, made more efficient, or discontinued
	 
	Reviewing the clarity and effectiveness of budget documents and communications
	 
	Presenting progress reports on the committee's work and a final report of recommendations to the Superintendent or designee and to the Board

The specific duties of the committee shall be clearly defined and presented to each member in writing, along with any background information necessary for the successful completion of the committee's charges, the timelines for reporting the committee's progress, and timelines for completion of each task.

Public Hearing

The agenda for the public hearing on the District budget shall be posted at least 72 hours before the hearing and shall indicate the location where the budget may be inspected. The proposed budget shall be available for public inspection at least three working days before this hearing.  (Education Code 42103, 42127, 52062)

The Superintendent or designee shall notify the County Superintendent of Schools of the location and dates at which the proposed budget may be inspected, as well as the location, date, and time of the public hearing, in sufficient time for the County Superintendent to publish such information in a newspaper of general circulation at least 10 days but not more than 45 days before the hearing, as specified in Education Code 42103. Beginning January 1, 2027, this notification, rather than being published in a newspaper of general circulation as described above, shall be prominently posted on the homepage of the District's website at least three days before the availability of the proposed budget for public inspection.

Whenever the proposed District budget includes a combined assigned and unassigned ending fund balance that exceeds the minimum recommended reserve for economic uncertainties adopted by the State Board of Education, the District shall provide, for each fiscal year included in the budget, the following information for public review and discussion at the public hearing:  (Education Code 42127; 5 CCR 15450)

	The minimum recommended reserve for economic uncertainties
	 
	The combined assigned and unassigned ending fund balances that are in excess of the minimum recommended reserve
	 
	A statement of reasons substantiating the need for the combined assigned and unassigned ending balances that are in excess of the minimum recommended reserve

During the hearing, any District resident may appear and object to the proposed budget or to any item in the budget. The hearing may conclude when all residents who have requested to be heard have had the opportunity to speak.  (Education Code 42103)

Budget Review Committee for Disapproved Budgets

If the District's budget is disapproved by the County Superintendent for any reason other than disapproval of the District's LCAP or annual update to the LCAP, the budget shall be reviewed by a budget review committee, unless the Board and County Superintendent agree to waive the requirement and the California Department of Education accepts the waiver.  (Education Code 42127)

This committee shall consist of either:  (Education Code 42127.1, 42127.2)

	Three persons selected by the Board from a list of candidates provided by the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI), who shall be selected within five working days after receiving the list of candidates
	 
	A regional review committee selected and convened by the County Superintendent with the approval of the Board and SPI


If the budget review committee recommends disapproval of the District budget, the Board may submit a response to the SPI no later than five working days after receipt of the committee's report. The response may include any revisions to the adopted final budget and any other proposed actions to be taken as a result of the committee's recommendations.  (Education Code 42127.3)

If the SPI disapproves the District budget after reviewing the committee's report and the District's response, the Board shall consult with the County Superintendent to develop and adopt, by December 31, a fiscal plan and budget that will allow the District to meet its current fiscal year and multiyear financial obligations. For the current fiscal year, the District shall operate in accordance with the budget adopted by the County Superintendent.  (Education Code 42127.3)

Until the District receives approval of its budget, it shall continue to operate either on the basis of the prior year's budget or on the basis of the current year's unapproved budget as adopted and revised by the Board, whichever budget contains a lower total spending authority.  (Education Code 42127.4)
