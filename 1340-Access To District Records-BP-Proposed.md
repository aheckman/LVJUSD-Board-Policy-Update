## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the right of members of the public to have access to public records of the District. The District shall provide any person reasonable access to the public records of the schools and District during normal business hours and within the requirements of law.  Public access shall not be given to records listed as exempt from public disclosure in the California Public Records Act and other state or federal law.

In response to a public records request, the Superintendent or designee shall make reasonable efforts to locate the requested records, including, but not limited to, any electronic communication substantively related to the records, such as email, text messages, instant messages, and other electronic communications, regardless of whether they are transmitted through a District-provided device or account or through an employee's or Board member's personal device or account.

The District may charge for copies of public records or other materials requested by individuals or groups, unless they are using their own personal equipment to reproduce the record.  The charge shall be based on actual costs of duplication, as determined by the Superintendent or designee and as specified in administrative regulation.

In order to help maintain the security of District records, members of the public granted access shall examine records in the presence of a District staff member.
