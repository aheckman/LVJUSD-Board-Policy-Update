## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following bylaw is optional.
The Governing Board recognizes that the Board is the unit of authority over the district and that a Board member has no individual authority.  Board members shall hold the education of students above any partisan principle, group interest, or personal interest.

CSBA NOTE: Boards should carefully review the following paragraph and modify it to reflect district practice.
Unless agreed to by the Board as a whole, individual members of the Board shall not exercise any administrative responsibility with respect to the schools or command the services of any school employee.  Individual Board members shall submit requests for information to the Superintendent.  Board members shall refer Board-related correspondence to the Superintendent for forwarding to the Board or for placement on the Board's agenda, as appropriate.

Individual Board members do not have the authority to resolve complaints.  Any Board member approached directly by a person with a complaint should refer the complainant to the Superintendent or designee so that the problem may receive proper consideration and be handled through the appropriate district process. 

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional.  Pursuant to Education Code 51101, parents/guardians have the right to observe and/or volunteer in their child's classroom.  Although this right is not affected upon election to the Board, Board members who have children attending district schools should be aware of their status as Board members and the effect of that status on district employees.
A Board member whose child is attending a district school should be aware of his/her role as a Board member when interacting with district employees about his/her child.  Because his/her position as a Board member may inhibit the performance of school personnel, the Board member should inform the Superintendent or designee before volunteering in his/her child's classroom. 

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54952.7, the Board may require a copy of the Brown Act to be given to each Board member and to any person elected to the Board who has not assumed office.  The following paragraph is optional.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide a copy of the state's open meeting laws (Brown Act) to each Board member and to anyone who is elected to the Board but has not yet assumed office.

Board members and persons elected to the Board who have not yet assumed office are responsible for complying with the requirements of the Brown Act.  (Government Code 54952.1)
