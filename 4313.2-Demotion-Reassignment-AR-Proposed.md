Certificated Administrative Employees

Permanent certificated management staff are not entitled to seniority rights in their administrative positions.  However, such staff shall earn and/or retain any seniority earned in service as a classroom teacher or site administrator pursuant to Education Code 44893, 44894, or 44956.5. 

End of Year Release/Reassignment of Certificated Administrators

By March 15, an employee shall be notified by either registered mail or in person that he/she may be released or reassigned from his/her position for the following school year.  If the notice is presented to the employee in person, the District shall obtain his/her signature acknowledging receipt of the notice on the District's copy of the written notice.  (Education Code 44951)

If the March 15 notice indicates that release or reassignment is only a possibility, the Board of Education shall take additional action to release/reassign the employee before the new school year and shall send the employee a second notice by June 30 indicating that he/she has been released or reassigned.

If the employee is to be released or reassigned to a teaching position, the Board shall give the employee, upon his/her request, a written statement of the reasons for the release/reassignment.  If the reasons include incompetence as an administrator or supervisor, the District shall have completed an evaluation of the employee within the 60-day period immediately preceding the notice date.  (Education Code 44896)
