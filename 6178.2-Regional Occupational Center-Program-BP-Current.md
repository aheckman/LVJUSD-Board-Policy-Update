## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is for use by any district with high school students who attend a Regional occupational center or program (ROC/P). ROC/Ps established pursuant to Education Code 52300-52335.12 allow students from various schools or districts to attend career technical education programs at a designated facility, regardless of the geographic location of their residence in a county or region, and are intended to provide advanced, focused occupational training. ROC/P classes also may be held on high school campuses.
The Governing Board desires to provide opportunities for district students to receive specialized training and career technical skills through a regional occupational center or program (ROC/P) that prepares them for employment, advanced training, or postsecondary education.

CSBA NOTE:     Education Code 52301 authorizes the establishment of an ROC/P by (1) the County Superintendent of Schools, with the approval of the State Board of Education (SBE); (2) two or more districts through a joint powers agreement (JPA), with the approval of the SBE and the County Superintendent; or (3) a single district with an average daily attendance (ADA) of 50,000 or more located in a class 1 county or a district with an ADA of 100,000 or more located in a class 2 county, as defined in Education Code 1205.The district should select the appropriate option below.
OPTION 1:  (Participation in County-Operated ROC/P)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraphs are for use by districts whose students participate in an ROC/P maintained by the County Superintendent. Pursuant to Education Code 52310.5, the governing board of a county ROC/P is the County Board of Education. The following option reflects information provided in the California Department of Education's (CDE) Regional Occupational Centers and Programs Operations Handbook regarding this type of delivery system and should be revised to reflect district practice.
The district shall refer eligible students to an ROC/P that has been established by the County Superintendent of Schools and is under the governance of the County Board of Education. (Education Code 52301, 52310.5)

The Board and Superintendent or designee shall maintain effective communications with the County Board and County Superintendent in order to ensure that district students receive a high-quality career technical program. The Superintendent or designee shall work with the County Superintendent to identify appropriate means for the district to provide input into ROC/P program development, budget adoption, program evaluation, and other matters. 

The Board may enter into a contract with the county-operated ROC/P to provide district teachers, student support services, facilities, or other services to students enrolled in the ROC/P.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Multidistrict JPA)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraphs are for use by districts that participate in the operation of an ROC/P through a JPA with one or more other districts. Pursuant to Education Code 52310.5, the governing board of an ROC/P maintained by two or more districts consists of at least one member of the board of each participating school district, selected by the board of that district. The following option reflects information provided in the CDE's Regional Occupational Centers and Programs Operations Handbook regarding this type of delivery system and should be revised to reflect district practice.
The district shall jointly operate an ROC/P with one or more other school districts in accordance with the terms of a joint powers agreement (JPA). The Board shall select one or more members of the Board to represent the district on the governing board of the ROC/P.  (Education Code 52301, 52310.5)

Pursuant to Education Code 52310.5, the governing board of an ROC/P maintained by a single school district is the board of that school district.Districts operating their own ROC/Ps should review all applicable legal requirements, the CDE's Regional Occupational Centers and Programs Operations Handbook, and the CDE's Model Programs and Practices which presents standards and quality indicators used to recognize exemplary programs in the areas of curriculum and instruction, student accomplishments, community involvement and collaboration, business services, organizational structure, personnel services, program accountability, and student support services. The district may choose to maintain a separate policy manual and administrative regulations governing the operations of the ROC/P.
The district shall operate its own ROC/P, with the district Board serving as the governing board of the ROC/P.  (Education Code 52301, 52310.5)

Depending on the course, students may also receive industry certification that is recognized regionally, statewide, or nationally. In addition, many ROC/P courses are articulated with a local community college district and also award college credit upon successful completion.
Credits earned from courses completed in an ROC/P may be applied toward fulfillment of high school graduation course requirements.  (Education Code 51225.3, 52310)

Student Services

CSBA NOTE:     The following optional section applies to all districts with students attending an ROC/P of any type.Education Code 52311 authorizes the district to provide or arrange for transportation between the district school and the ROC/P.

The Board shall annually hold a public hearing to review and assess the participation of district students in grades 11-12 in the ROC/P and shall adopt an annual plan to increase participation of students in this program, unless it is determined that there are no additional district students who would benefit from this participation.  (Education Code 52304.1)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. ROC/Ps that receive funding under the federal Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (20 USC 2301-2414) must annually submit a program evaluation to the CDE which addresses core indicators of performance; also see BP/AR 6178 - Career Technical Education. Pursuant to Education Code 52335.12, when longitudinal data on students enrolled in ROC/Ps can be disaggregated from the California longitudinal student achievement data system established pursuant to Education Code 60900, each ROC/P will be expected to annually report to the CDE on the academic and workforce preparation progress of the secondary students enrolled in the ROC/P as a condition of receiving additional funding based on ADA.
