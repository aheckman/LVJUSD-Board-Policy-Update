## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that student participation in fund-raising activities for the schools and nonprofit, nonpartisan charitable organizations can help develop a sense of social responsibility in students, enhance the relationship between the school and community, and contribute to the improvement of the school program.

Whether solicitations are made on behalf of the school or on behalf of a charitable organization, students shall not be barred from an event or activity because they did not participate in fund-raising.  Potential donors, including parents/guardians and members of the community, should not be unduly pressured to contribute to the school system or charitable organizations.  Staff is expected to emphasize the fact that donations are always voluntary.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that parents/guardians are informed of the purpose of fund-raisers. 

Solicitations on Behalf of the School

With the prior written approval of the Superintendent or designee, official school-related organizations may organize fund-raising events involving students. 

After the fund-raiser has been held, parents/guardians shall be informed how much money was raised and how it was spent. 

Solicitations on Behalf of Charities

When approved in advance by the Superintendent or designee, nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations that are properly chartered or licensed by state or federal law may solicit students on school grounds during school hours and within one hour before school has opened and one hour after school has closed.  (Education Code 51520)
