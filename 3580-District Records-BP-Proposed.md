## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the importance of securing and retaining District documents. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that District records are developed, maintained, and disposed of in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.

The Superintendent or designee shall consult with District legal counsel, site administrators, District information technology staff, personnel department staff, and others as necessary to develop a secure document management system that provides for the storage, retrieval, archiving, and destruction of District documents, including electronically stored information such as email. This document management system shall be designed to comply with state and federal laws regarding security of records, record retention and destruction, response to "litigation hold" discovery requests, and the recovery of records in the event of a disaster or emergency.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure the confidentiality of records as required by law and shall establish regulations to safeguard data against damage, loss, or theft, including damage, loss, or theft which may be caused by cybersecurity breaches.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that employees receive information about the District's document management system, including retention and confidentiality requirements and an employee's obligations in the event of a litigation hold or California Public Records Act request established on the advice of legal counsel. Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that employees receive information and training about cybersecurity, including ways to protect District records from breaches to the District's digital infrastructure.

If the District discovers or is notified that a breach in the security of District records has resulted in the release of personal information, the Superintendent or designee shall notify every individual whose personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person, if that information was either unencrypted or encrypted under the circumstances specified in Civil Code 1798.29. "Personal information" includes, but is not limited to, a social security number, driver's license or identification card number, medical information, health insurance information, or an account number in combination with an access code or password that would permit access to a financial account.  (Civil Code 1798.29)

The Superintendent or designee shall provide the notice in a timely manner either in writing or electronically, unless otherwise provided in law. The notice shall include the material specified in Civil Code 1798.29, be formatted as required, and be distributed in a timely manner, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement to conduct an uncompromised investigation or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity of the data system.  (Civil Code 1798.29)

If the District experiences a cyberattack that impacts more than 500 students or personnel, the Superintendent or designee shall report the cyberattack to the California Cybersecurity Integration Center.  (Education Code 35266)

Safe at Home Program

District public records shall not include the actual addresses of students, parents/guardians, or employees when a substitute address is designated by the Secretary of State pursuant to the Safe at Home program.  (Government Code 6206, 6207)

When a substitute address card is provided pursuant to this program, the confidential, actual address may be used only to establish District residency requirements for enrollment and for school emergency purposes.

Records containing a participant's confidential address information shall be kept in a confidential location and not shared with the public.
