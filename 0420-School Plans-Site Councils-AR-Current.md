## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation may be revised to reflect district practice.
School Site Councils

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 64001, each school participating in a federal or state categorical program which is funded through the state's consolidated application and requires a school plan for student achievement (SPSA) must establish a school site council that meets the requirements of Education Code 65000-65001, as added by AB 716 (Ch. 471, Statutes of 2018). The school site council is responsible for developing and reviewing the SPSA; see section "School Plan for Student Achievement" below. AB 716 eliminated the authority for another school advisory committee or school group to serve as the school site council for a school that operates a program requiring an SPSA.Pursuant to Education Code 65000, a school site council must generally include members from all of the categories listed in items #1-5 below, as applicable. However, pursuant to Education Code 65001, a school with a student population of less than 300 may operate a school site council which includes at least one representative from items #1-3 and at least one from items #4-5, provided there is parity between staff and non-staff members and the Governing Board has obtained approval from its local bargaining unit. Education Code 65001 also provides that schools with a common site administration may operate a shared school site council if the school has a student population of less than 300, and up to three schools with a combined student population of less than 1,000 may operate a shared school site council if the schools either share a campus or have geographic proximity to one another with similar student populations. Any shared school site council must meet the requirements of Education Code 65000 with regard to the composition of the council. Districts with any schools meeting these criteria may revise the following section accordingly.For information about the organization of the school site council, including sample school site council bylaws that address duties, membership, officers, subcommittees, and meetings, see the California Department of Education's (CDE) publication A Guide for Developing the Single Plan for Student Achievement: A Resource for the School Site Council, available on CDE's web site.
Each school that operates a program requiring the development of a school plan for student achievement (SPSA) pursuant to Education Code 64001 shall have a school site council composed of the following:  (Education Code 65000)

	The principal or designee
	 
	Classroom teachers at the school, selected by the classroom teachers at the school
	 
	Other school personnel who are not teachers, selected by the other personnel at the school who are not teachers
	 
	Parents/guardians of students attending the school and/or other members of the community, selected by the parents/guardians of students attending the school
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 65000 requires that secondary schools include students on their school site council. Pursuant to Education Code 52 and 53, secondary schools include high schools and junior high schools. CDE's publication A Guide for Developing the Single Plan for Student Achievement: A Resource for the School Site Council advises that middle schools may include student representation on the school site council at the district's discretion. If the district decides to include middle school or K-8 students on the school site council, then such councils must meet the composition required of secondary schools.
	If the school is a secondary school, students attending the school selected by other secondary students

Half of the school site council membership shall consist of school staff in the categories listed in items #1-3 above, the majority of whom shall be classroom teachers. For an elementary school site council, the remaining half shall be parents/guardians and/or community members. For a secondary school site council, the remaining half shall be parents/guardians, community members, and/or students.  (Education Code 65000)

A district employee may serve as a parent/guardian representative on the school site council of the school his/her child attends, provided the employee does not work at that school.  (Education Code 65000)

CSBA NOTE: The method of selecting members of school site councils is not specified in law, except that members must be chosen by peers as noted above. No additional membership qualifications may be required. CDE's publication A Guide for Developing the Single Plan for Student Achievement: A Resource for the School Site Council suggests that the selection process may be addressed in Board policy or in bylaws of the school site council. The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The bylaws of each school site council shall include the method of selecting members and officers, terms of office, responsibilities of council members, time commitment, and a policy of nondiscrimination and equity.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35147, school site councils are exempt from open meeting law requirements (the Brown Act), but must comply with other, less complex procedural requirements as specified; see AR 1220 - Citizen Advisory Committees. Education Code 35147 has not yet been amended for consistency with AB 716, which repealed Education Code 52852 and moved the requirements related to school site councils to Education Code 65000-65001.
School site councils shall operate in accordance with procedural meeting requirements established in Education Code 35147.

School Plan for Student Achievement

CSBA NOTE: The following section reflects requirements pertaining to the development of the SPSA required for the state and federal categorical programs included in the consolidated application. CDE has developed a template for the SPSA, available on its web site, to help schools meet plan requirements.
The school site council shall develop and annually review and update an SPSA that addresses all federal and/or state categorical programs in which the school participates pursuant to Education Code 64000.  (Education Code 64001)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 64001, as amended by AB 716, the SPSA must be developed with the review and advice of the school English learner advisory committee, if required. Education Code 52176 and 5 CCR 11308 require each school with more than 20 English learners to establish a school-level advisory committee on which parents/guardians of such students constitute membership in at least the same percentage as their children represent of the total number of students in the school. See AR 6174 - Education for English Learners.
The SPSA shall be developed with the review, certification, and advice of the school English learner advisory committee, if required.  (Education Code 64001)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
Other school and district committees, including, but not limited to, a parent advisory committee established to review and comment on the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP), advisory committee established for special education programs, and Western Association of Schools and Colleges leadership teams, may also be consulted on the content of the plan.

CSBA NOTE: As amended by AB 716, Education Code 64001 requires the school site council to administer a comprehensive needs assessment that forms the basis of the goals in the SPSA. If any district schools are not participating in any state or federal categorical program that requires a plan but the Board requires them to develop an SPSA, the Board may determine the extent to which the needs assessment is applicable and the following paragraph may be revised accordingly.
Before developing the content of the SPSA, the school site council shall conduct a comprehensive needs assessment pursuant to 20 USC 6314, including an analysis of verifiable state data consistent with the state priorities specified in Education Code 52060 and the indicators in the state accountability system. The school may consider any other data developed by the district to measure student outcomes.  (Education Code 64001)

The SPSA shall include all of the following:  (Education Code 64001)


	 Goals to improve student outcomes, including goals that address the needs of student groups as identified through the needs assessment
	 
	Evidence-based strategies, actions, or services
	 
	Proposed expenditures based on the projected resource allocation from the district to address the findings of the needs assessment, including identifying resource inequities, which may include a review of the district's budgeting, the LCAP, and school-level budgeting, if applicable

CSBA NOTE: CDE's publication A Guide for Developing the Single Plan for Student Achievement: A Resource for the School Site Council clarifies that the SPSA must address all plan components required for individual categorical programs covered by the SPSA.
In addition to meeting the requirements common to all applicable school plans, the SPSA shall address any content required by law for each individual categorical program in which the school participates.

The school site council shall approve the proposed SPSA at a meeting for which public notice has been posted. Whenever there are material revisions to the SPSA which affect the academic programs for students participating in applicable programs, the SPSA shall be submitted to the Governing Board for review and approval at a regularly scheduled Board meeting.  (Education Code 35147, 64001)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 64001, as amended by AB 716, the SPSA must include a process for evaluating and monitoring the implementation of the SPSA and progress toward accomplishing the goals set forth in the SPSA. CDE's publication A Guide for Developing the Single Plan for Student Achievement: A Resource for the School Site Council contains an annual evaluation tool to assist school site councils in assessing the effectiveness of the plan.
The school site council shall regularly monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the SPSA and modify any activities that prove ineffective. At least once per year, the principal or designee shall evaluate results of improvement efforts and report to the Board, school site council, and other interested parties regarding progress toward school goals.

The school site council may amend the SPSA at any time through the same process required for the annual update of the plan.
