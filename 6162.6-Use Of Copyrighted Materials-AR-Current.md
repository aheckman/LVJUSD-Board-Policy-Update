## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 17 USC 101-122, district staff must seek permission from the copyright owner to reproduce and distribute a copyrighted work, except when the material is in the public domain or the use meets the criteria for an exception specified in 17 USC 107-122. Exceptions applicable to schools include "fair use" (17 USC 107); library reproduction and archiving (17 USC 108); first sale (17 USC 109); and classroom performance, display, and distance education (17 USC 110).
Prior to reproducing, distributing, displaying, posting, performing, or otherwise using a copyrighted material for an instructional purpose or in the course of other district business, district staff shall determine whether it is necessary to request permission of the copyright holder. Unless the staff member is reasonably certain that the material is in the public domain or the intended use meets the criteria for an exception specified in 17 USC 107-122 and this administrative regulation, he/she shall either obtain permission from the copyright holder or avoid use of the material. In addition, permission of the copyright holder shall be requested whenever district staff intend to publicly disseminate a copyrighted work, such as by posting on the district or school web site or using another method of communications accessible to the public.

Any reproduction or other use of a copyrighted work shall include the copyright notice.

District staff shall not reproduce and distribute copyrighted works of any type in any of the following circumstances:
 

	When the copyrighted work is a "consumable" work such as a workbook, standardized test, answer sheet, or similar material
	 
	To substitute for the purchase of the work
	 
	To create, replace, or substitute for anthologies or collective works


Request for Permission to Use Copyrighted Material

CSBA NOTE: Determining the owner of a copyright can sometimes be difficult because the author or creator of a work is not required to register a copyright or affix a copyright notice to the work. Once a work is created and fixed in a tangible form, it is protected by federal copyright law. To find the holder of a copyright, it may be necessary to conduct a search through the U.S. Copyright Office or request information from the author or publisher of the work. For information about copyright searches, see U.S. Copyright Office publications Circular 22: How to Investigate and Copyright Status of a Work and Circular 23: The Copyright Card Catalog and the Online Files of the Copyright Office.
As necessary, district staff desiring to use a copyrighted material shall identify and contact the copyright holder to request permission to use the material.  The request shall include the following information:
 

	Title, author(s), editor(s) or publisher, producer(s) or distributor
	 
	Edition, copyright, and/or production year
	 
	Exact amount of material to be used, such as the number of lines, pages, or chapters or percentage of the work
	 
	Nature of the use, such as the course in which it will be used, the grade level of the students, the number of students, and the frequency of use
	 
	How the material will be reproduced and distributed


If the copyright holder requires a fee to grant permission, district staff shall seek approval from the Superintendent or designee prior to incurring the cost.

Criteria for Fair Use

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 17 USC 107, limited portions of copyrighted materials may be reproduced without the copyright owner's permission when the intended use meets the criteria of "fair use." In determining whether the use of a copyrighted material is fair use, the courts have weighed together all four factors specified in 17 USC 107, as described in the following section. Courts have concluded that no individual factor is sufficient by itself; rather, the determination of fair use requires a complex analysis of the interaction of all four factors. District legal counsel should be consulted as needed.
In considering whether a copyrighted work may be used without the copyright holder's permission on the grounds that the intended use is "fair use" pursuant to 17 USC 107, including reproduction in copies, phonorecords, or any other reproductive form for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, district staff shall consider all of the following factors:  (17 USC 107)

CSBA NOTE: Although nonprofit educational purposes are granted consideration in determining fair use pursuant to 17 USC 107 (item #1 below), the U.S. Supreme Court in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., emphasized that a nonprofit educational purpose alone does not automatically ensure fair use.


	The purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or for nonprofit educational purposes
	
	CSBA NOTE: In weighing the impact of the nature of the copyrighted work (item #2 below), the court in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. noted that the more creative a work (e.g., fiction), the more protection from copying it should be accorded, whereas more informational or functional works should, as a general rule, receive less protection.
	The nature of the copyrighted work
	
	CSBA NOTE:  The third factor specified in 17 USC 107, as provided in item #3 below, requires consideration of both the amount copied in relation to the overall work and whether the excerpt is a "critical part" of the work. The court in Cambridge University Press et al. v. Becker et al. concluded that copying of no more than 10 percent of the pages in the book, when almost none of those pages bore a close relationship to the book as a whole, was permissible under the third factor of fair use.
	The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
	
	CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to 17 USC 107, any fair use of the copyrighted work based on items #1-3 above must be balanced with the financial harm that the use would have on the potential market or value of the work. In Cambridge University Press et al. v. Becker et al., the court held that an identical copy of the work, especially a larger excerpt, is more likely to substitute for the work and reduce its value, whereas a 10 percent excerpt would not substitute for the original no matter how many copies were made. In this case, it was found that materials were used under carefully monitored circumstances, with a password required for digital access and access being terminated at the end of the semester, thereby reducing the risk of the materials being exposed to persons other than the students in the class.
	The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work
	 

CSBA NOTE: Although fair use cannot be determined solely on the basis of the number of words, pages, or chapters reproduced or the percentage of the excerpt in relation to the whole (item #3 above), stakeholder groups have agreed upon some nonbinding minimum guidelines which are included in the U.S. Copyright Office's Circular 21: Reproduction of Copyrighted Works by Educators and Librarians, available on its web site. The remainder of this administrative regulation reflects these guidelines; however, district staff must consider all four factors specified in 17 USC 107 prior to using a copyrighted material without permission.
Any determination of fair use shall weigh together all the factors specified in items #1-4 above in addition to any applicable guidelines presented in this administrative regulation for specific types of copyrighted works.

Guidelines for Copying Text

CSBA NOTE: The following section reflects nonbinding guidelines included in the U.S. Copyright Office's Circular 21: Reproduction of Copyrighted Works by Educators and Librarians. Although the guidelines do not address the use of copyrighted works available on the Internet or through other technological resources, it is generally accepted that the use of such copyrighted works would follow the same guidelines established for other fixed and tangible works. Thus, the following section applies to any copyrighted text regardless of its source or format. The district should consult legal counsel as necessary.
Staff may reproduce text from a copyrighted work from a printed resource, the Internet, or other source, without permission from the copyright holder, under the following conditions:
 

	A single copy of a chapter of a book, article from a periodical or newspaper, short story, short essay, short poem, chart, graph, diagram, drawing, cartoon, or picture may be made by or for a teacher for his/her scholarly research or use in teaching or preparation to teach a class.
	 
	Multiple copies, not to exceed one copy per student in a course, may be made by or for a teacher for classroom use or discussion, provided that:
	 
	
		The amount to be copied does not exceed:
		 
		
			250 words for a complete poem or excerpt from a poem
			 
			2,500 words for a complete article, story, or essay
			 
			1,000 words or 10 percent of the whole (with a minimum of 500 words), whichever is less, for an excerpt from a larger prose work
			 
			One illustration (e.g., chart, graph, diagram, cartoon, or picture) per book or periodical issue
			 
		
		
		The copying is for only one course in the school.
		 
		With the exception of newspapers and other news periodicals, not more than one work is copied from the same author per term, not more than three works are copied from the same collective work or periodical volume per term, and there are no more than nine instances of multiple copying per course per term.
		 
		A delay to request permission from the copyright holder would preclude the most effective instructional use of the material.
	
	


Guidelines for Reproducing Sheet and Recorded Music

CSBA NOTE: The following section reflects nonbinding guidelines included in the U.S. Copyright Office's Circular 21: Reproduction of Copyrighted Works by Educators and Librarians.
District staff may reproduce sheet music and recorded music without permission from the copyright holder under the following conditions:


	Emergency copies may be made when purchased copies needed for an imminent performance are not available, provided that replacement copies shall be purchased in due course.
	 
	Single or multiple copies of excerpts of works may be made for academic purposes other than performances, provided that the excerpt does not constitute an entire performable unit (e.g., a section, movement, or aria), no more than 10 percent of the total work is used, and the number of copies made does not exceed one per student.
	 
	Printed copies that have been purchased may be edited or simplified provided that the character of the work is not distorted and lyrics are not added or altered.
	 
	A single copy of a recorded performance by students may be made for evaluation or rehearsal purposes.
	 
	 A single copy of recordings of copyrighted music owned by the district or individual teacher may be made for the purpose of constructing exercises or examinations.


Guidelines for Performing or Displaying Copyrighted Works

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 17 USC 101, the holder of a copyright for a motion picture or other audiovisual work retains exclusive rights for public performances of the work (i.e., exhibitions outside of one's home to a normal circle of family and social acquaintances), except that 17 USC 110 provides an exception for performance or display of the work in face-to-face instruction. In such circumstances, it is not necessary to conduct an analysis of fair use nor obtain permission of the copyright holder. Pursuant to 17 USC 110, this exception only applies if the district (1) institutes a policy regarding copyright; (2) provides informational materials on federal copyright laws to students, teachers, and other relevant staff; and (3) provides notice to students that materials used in connection with the course may be subject to copyright protection.
In the course of face-to-face instruction in a classroom or similar place devoted to instruction, teachers or students may recite, render, play, dance, act, or show a copyrighted work either directly or by means of any device or process or, in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible, provided that:  (17 USC 101, 110)
 

	The performance or display is given by means of a lawfully obtained copy of the work.
	 
	The performance or display is made by, at the direction of, or under the actual supervision of a teacher as an integral part of a class session.
	 
	The performance or display is directly related and of material assistance to the teaching content of the transmission.
	 
	The transmission is limited to students enrolled in the course or to Governing Board members or employees as part of their official duties or employment.
	 
	If the work is to be digitally transmitted, the district has applied technological protections that reasonably prevent retention of the work in accessible form for longer than the class session and the unauthorized further dissemination of the work.
	 

CSBA NOTE: 17 USC 110 addresses reasonable pedagogical purposes for showing films or other audiovisual works. According to the National School Boards Association's publication Copyright Law: Do Schools Need a License to Show a Movie?, any use of a motion picture outside the curriculum (e.g., to reward students for good behavior or to host a movie night to encourage parent and community engagement) does not meet the above criteria and therefore would require the school to obtain a special viewing license. The publication also presents information about how to obtain a one-time license or a blanket license for showing an unlimited number of movies.
Any use of a motion picture or other audiovisual work outside the curriculum, such as for entertainment, a school or class reward, or a fundraiser, shall require permission from the copyright holder or a special viewing license.

Guidelines for Recording Broadcast Programming

CSBA NOTE: The following section reflects nonbinding guidelines included in the U.S. Copyright Office's Circular 21: Reproduction of Copyrighted Works by Educators and Librarians for fair use of off-air recording of free television programming. Although the guidelines do not address radio broadcasts, it may be assumed that similar guidelines would apply. Legal counsel should be consulted as necessary.
Teachers may make recordings of television programs for use in a classroom for educational purposes under the following conditions:
 

	Only programs provided to the public free of charge may be recorded and shown. Any use of programming from paid television services shall require permission of the copyright holder.
	 
	The recording may be shown only during the first 10 consecutive school days after it is made. It may be used once by an individual teacher in the course of relevant teaching activities and may be repeated once only when instructional reinforcement is necessary.
	 
	A limited number of copies may be reproduced from each recording to meet the legitimate needs of the teacher. Each copy shall be subject to all the provisions governing the original recording.
	 
	The recording may be retained for 45 calendar days after it is made and then shall be erased or destroyed. However, after the first 10 consecutive school days, the recording may only be used for purposes of determining whether or not to include the broadcast program in the teaching curriculum. If the teacher decides to keep the program for use in the curriculum, he/she shall request permission from the copyright owner.
	 
	Off-air recordings need not be used in their entirety, but the content of recorded programs may not be altered.


Guidelines for Copying Computer Programs or Software

District staff shall observe all licensing agreements between vendors and the district, including monitoring the number of users permitted by an agreement.  Unless the applicable licensing agreement authorizes multiple users of a single computer program or software, the district shall not make multiple copies.

Copies of district-owned software may be made under either of the following conditions:  (17 USC 117)
 

	The copy is needed as an essential step in using the computer program with a particular machine.
	 
	The copy is used for archival or "backup" purposes only.  This copy may be held only as a file copy and must be destroyed in the event that continued possession of the program ceases to be rightful, unless the copyright owner authorizes its sale, lease, or transfer as part of the sale, lease, or transfer of the original program.

According to the National School Boards Association's publication Copyright Law: Do Schools Need a License to Show a Movie?, any use of a motion picture outside the curriculum (e.g., to reward students for good behavior or to host a movie night to encourage parent and community engagement) does not meet the above criteria and therefore would require the school to obtain a special viewing license. The publication also presents information about how to obtain a one-time license or a blanket license for showing an unlimited number of movies.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="YMjQMA11" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22YMjQMA11%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22kMA934%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1573675789%2C%22text%22%3A%2217%20USC%20110%20addresses%20reasonable%20pedagogical%20purposes%20for%20showing%20films%20or%20other%20audiovisual%20works.%20According%20to%20the%20National%20School%20Boards%20Association%27s%20publication%20Copyright%20Law%3A%20Do%20Schools%20Need%20a%20License%20to%20Show%20a%20Movie%3F%2C%20any%20use%20of%20a%20motion%20picture%20outside%20the%20curriculum%20%28e.g.%2C%20to%20reward%20students%20for%20good%20behavior%20or%20to%20host%20a%20movie%20night%20to%20encourage%20parent%20and%20community%20engagement%29%20does%20not%20meet%20the%20above%20criteria%20and%20therefore%20would%20require%20the%20school%20to%20obtain%20a%20special%20viewing%20license.%20The%20publication%20also%20presents%20information%20about%20how%20to%20obtain%20a%20one-time%20license%20or%20a%20blanket%20license%20for%20showing%20an%20unlimited%20number%20of%20movies.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-YMjQMA11" title="CSBA NOTE: 17 USC 110 addresses reasonable pedagog..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
