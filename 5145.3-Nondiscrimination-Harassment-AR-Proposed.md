Process for Initiating and Responding to Complaints

Students who feel that they have been subjected to unlawful discrimination described above or in District policy are strongly encouraged to immediately contact the Compliance Officer, Title IX Coordinator, principal, or any other staff member. In addition, students who observe any such incident are strongly encouraged to report the incident to the Compliance Officer, Title IX Coordinator, or principal, regardless of whether the alleged victim files a complaint.

Any District employee who observes an incident of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, or to whom such an incident is reported, shall report the incident to the Compliance Officer, Title IX Coordinator, or principal within one workday, regardless of whether the alleged victim files a complaint.

Any school employee who witnesses an incident of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, shall immediately intervene to stop the incident when it is safe to do so.  (Education Code 234.1)

When a report of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, is made to or received by the principal, Compliance Officer, or Title IX Coordinator, the principal, Compliance Officer, or Title IX Coordinator shall notify the student or parent/guardian of the right to file a formal complaint in accordance with Administrative Regulation 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures or, for complaints of sexual harassment that meet the federal Title IX definition, Administrative Regulation 5145.71 - Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures. Once notified verbally or in writing, the Compliance Officer or Title IX Coordinator shall begin the investigation and shall implement immediate measures necessary to stop the discrimination and ensure that all students have access to the educational program and a safe school environment. Any interim measures adopted to address unlawful discrimination shall, to the extent possible, not disadvantage the complainant or a student who is the victim of the alleged unlawful discrimination.

Any report or complaint alleging unlawful discrimination by the principal, Compliance Officer, Title IX Coordinator, or any other person to whom a report would ordinarily be made or complaint filed shall instead be made to or filed with the Superintendent or designee who shall determine how the complaint will be investigated.

Support for Intersex, Nonbinary, Transgender and Gender-Nonconforming Students

Gender refers to a student's sex, and includes a student's gender identity and gender expression.  (Education Code 210.7)

Gender identity refers to a student's gender-related identity, appearance, or behavior as determined from the student's internal sense, regardless of whether that gender-related identity, appearance, or behavior is different from that traditionally associated with the student's physiology or assigned sex at birth.

Gender expression refers to a student's gender-related appearance and behavior, regardless of whether stereotypically associated with the student's assigned sex at birth.  (Education Code 210.7)

Gender transition refers to the process in which a student changes from living and identifying as the sex assigned to the student at birth to living and identifying as the sex that corresponds to the student's gender identity.

Gender-nonconforming refers to when a student's gender expression differs from stereotypical expectations.

Intersex refers to when a student has natural bodily variations in anatomy, hormones, chromosomes, and other traits that differ from expectations generally associated with female and male bodies.

Nonbinary refers to when a student's gender identity falls outside of the traditional conception of strictly either female or male, regardless of whether the student identifies as transgender, was born with intersex traits, uses gender-neutral pronouns, or uses agender, genderqueer, pangender, gender nonconforming, gender variant, or such other more specific term to describe their gender.

Sex refers to the biological condition of being a female or male human being.  (5 CCR 4910)

Transgender refers to when a student's gender identity is different from the sex assigned at birth.

The District shall ensure that all students, regardless of sex, gender, gender identity or gender expression, are afforded the same rights, benefits, and protections provided to students by law and Board policy. To do so, the Superintendent or designee shall address each situation that arises on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the following guidelines:

	Acceptance of a Student's Gender Identity: The District shall accept the student's assertion of the student's gender identity and treat the student consistent with that gender identity unless District personnel present a credible and supportable basis for believing that the student's assertion is for an improper purpose
	 
	Use of Names and Pronouns: Upon request by a student, District personnel shall address the student by the requested name and pronoun(s), without the necessity of a court order or a change to the student's mandatory permanent student record
	
	Inadvertent slips or honest mistakes by District personnel in the use of the student's name and/or pronouns may not constitute a violation of this administrative regulation or the accompanying Board policy.
	 
	Accessibility to Sex-Segregated Facilities, Programs, and Activities: When the District maintains sex-segregated facilities, such as restrooms and locker rooms, or offers sex-segregated programs and activities, such as physical education classes, intermural sports, and interscholastic athletic programs, students shall be permitted to access facilities and participate in programs and activities consistent with their gender identity
	
	Additionally, a student shall be permitted to participate in accordance with the student's gender identity in other circumstances where students are separated by sex, such as for class discussions, yearbook pictures, and field trips.
	
	To address any student's privacy concerns in using sex-segregated facilities, the District shall consider offering a gender-neutral or single-use restroom or changing area, a bathroom stall with a door, an area in the locker room separated by a curtain or screen, or use of the locker room before or after the other students. However, in no case shall the District require a student to utilize these options because of the student's sex, gender, gender identify, or gender expression. A student's right to participate in a sex-segregated activity in accordance with the student's gender identity shall not render invalid or inapplicable any other eligibility rule established for participation in the activity.
	
	Beginning July 1, 2026, each school shall provide and maintain at least one all-gender restroom for student use that meets the requirements of Education Code 35292.5.
	 
	Adherence to Uniforms/Dress Code: A student has the right to dress in a manner consistent with the student's gender identity, subject to any dress code adopted on a school site, which may not discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, gender identity or gender expression
	 
	Equal Access to Educational Programs and Activities: Upon request by a student based on the student's gender identity or gender expression, the Compliance Officer shall identify and develop strategies for ensuring that the student's access to educational programs and activities is maintained
	
	The Compliance Officer shall consider the rights of all students and how those rights may affect and be affected by the rights of other students. Additionally, the Compliance Officer shall identify specific school site employee(s) to whom the student may report any problem related to the student's sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression so that prompt action can be taken to address it. Alternatively, if appropriate and desired by the student, the school may form a support team for the student that will meet periodically to assess whether the arrangements for the student are providing equal access to programs and activities.
	 
	Right to privacy: A student's sex, gender, gender identity, and gender status is private information
	
	The District may only disclose such information to others when the disclosure is permitted by law, with the student's prior written consent, or when the District has compelling evidence that disclosure is necessary to preserve the student's physical or mental well-being.  (Education Code 220.3, 220.5; 34 CFR 99.31, 99.36)
	 
	Student Records: A student's sex and legal name shall be maintained as part of a student's mandatory permanent student record as specified in 5 CCR 432 and shall only be changed with proper documentation  (Education Code 49061-49072)
	
	When a request to change a student's gender or name is submitted without proper documentation, any change to the student's gender or name shall be applied only to documents not included in the mandatory permanent student record such as attendance sheets, report cards, and school identification.
	
	The Superintendent or designee shall follow this guideline such that it does not change or alter the obligations of the District to maintain student records in accordance with Board Policy/Administrative Regulation 5125 - Student Records, and to ensure access to such records in accordance with Board Policy/Administrative Regulation 1340 - Access to District Records.

The District prohibits any act of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility, including any such act based on sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression, or that have the purpose or effect of producing a negative impact on the student's academic performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational environment, regardless of whether the acts are sexual in nature, including, but not limited to:


	Refusing to address or refer to a student in a manner consistent with the student's gender identity
	 
	Disciplining a student or excluding the student from participating in activities, for behavior or appearance that is consistent with the student's gender identity or that does not conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity
	 
	Blocking, prohibiting, or restricting a student's entry to the restroom that corresponds to the student's gender identity
	 
	Disclosing student records that reveal a student's gender identity to individuals who do not have a legitimate need for the information except as permitted by law
	 
	Verbally or physically assaulting a student because of the student's sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression, including, but not limited to, causing, attempting to cause, threatening to cause, or participating in an act of hate violence on the basis of sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression

The District shall ensure that all students, regardless of sex, gender, gender identity or gender expression, are afforded the same rights, benefits, and protections provided to students by law and Board policy. To do so, the Superintendent or designee shall address each situation that arises on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the following guidelines:
<ol>
	<li>Acceptance of a Student&#39;s Gender Identity: The District shall accept the student&#39;s assertion of the student&#39;s gender identity and treat the student consistent with that gender identity unless District personnel present a credible and supportable basis for believing that the student&#39;s assertion is for an improper purpose<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Use of Names and Pronouns: Upon request by a student, District personnel shall address the student by the requested name and pronoun(s), without the necessity of a court order or a change to the student&#39;s mandatory permanent student record<br>
	<br>
	Inadvertent slips or honest mistakes by District personnel in the use of the student&#39;s name and/or pronouns may not constitute a violation of this administrative regulation or the accompanying Board policy.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Accessibility to Sex-Segregated Facilities, Programs, and Activities: When the District maintains sex-segregated facilities, such as restrooms and locker rooms, or offers sex-segregated programs and activities, such as physical education classes, intermural sports, and interscholastic athletic programs, students shall be permitted to access facilities and participate in programs and activities consistent with their gender identity<br>
	<br>
	Additionally, a student shall be permitted to participate in accordance with the student&#39;s gender identity in other circumstances where students are separated by sex, such as for class discussions, yearbook pictures, and field trips.<br>
	<br>
	To address any student&#39;s privacy concerns in using sex-segregated facilities, the District shall consider offering a gender-neutral or single-use restroom or changing area, a bathroom stall with a door, an area in the locker room separated by a curtain or screen, or use of the locker room before or after the other students. However, in no case shall the District require a student to utilize these options because of the student&#39;s sex, gender, gender identify, or gender expression. A student&#39;s right to participate in a sex-segregated activity in accordance with the student&#39;s gender identity shall not render invalid or inapplicable any other eligibility rule established for participation in the activity.<br>
	<br>
	Beginning July 1, 2026, each school shall provide and maintain at least one all-gender restroom for student use that meets the requirements of Education Code 35292.5.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Adherence to Uniforms/Dress Code: A student has the right to dress in a manner consistent with the student&#39;s gender identity, subject to any dress code adopted on a school site, which may not discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, gender identity or gender expression<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Equal Access to Educational Programs and Activities: Upon request by a student based on the student&#39;s gender identity or gender expression, the Compliance Officer shall identify and develop strategies for ensuring that the student&#39;s access to educational programs and activities is maintained<br>
	<br>
	The Compliance Officer shall consider the rights of all students and how those rights may affect and be affected by the rights of other students. Additionally, the Compliance Officer shall identify specific school site employee(s) to whom the student may report any problem related to the student&#39;s sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression so that prompt action can be taken to address it. Alternatively, if appropriate and desired by the student, the school may form a support team for the student that will meet periodically to assess whether the arrangements for the student are providing equal access to programs and activities.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Right to privacy: A student&#39;s sex, gender, gender identity, and gender status is private information<br>
	<br>
	The District may only disclose such information to others when the disclosure is permitted by law, with the student&#39;s prior written consent, or when the District has compelling evidence that disclosure is necessary to preserve the student&#39;s physical or mental well-being. &nbsp;(Education Code 220.3, 220.5; 34 CFR 99.31, 99.36)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Student Records: A student&#39;s sex and legal name shall be maintained as part of a student&#39;s mandatory permanent student record as specified in 5 CCR 432 and shall only be changed with proper documentation &nbsp;(Education Code 49061-49072)<br>
	<br>
	When a request to change a student&#39;s gender or name is submitted without proper documentation, any change to the student&#39;s gender or name shall be applied only to documents not included in the mandatory permanent student record such as attendance sheets, report cards, and school identification.<br>
	<br>
	The Superintendent or designee shall follow this guideline such that it does not change or alter the obligations of the District to maintain student records in accordance with Board Policy/Administrative Regulation 5125 - Student Records, and to ensure access to such records in accordance with Board Policy/Administrative Regulation 1340 - Access to District Records.</li>
</ol>
The District prohibits any act of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility, including any such act based on sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression, or that have the purpose or effect of producing a negative impact on the student&#39;s academic performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational environment, regardless of whether the acts are sexual in nature, including, but not limited to:

<ol>
	<li>Refusing to address or refer to a student in a manner consistent with the student&#39;s gender identity<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Disciplining a student or excluding the student from participating in activities, for behavior or appearance that is consistent with the student&#39;s gender identity or that does not conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Blocking, prohibiting, or restricting a student&#39;s entry to the restroom that corresponds to the student&#39;s gender identity<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Disclosing student records that reveal a student&#39;s gender identity to individuals who do not have a legitimate need for the information except as permitted by law<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Verbally or physically assaulting a student because of the student&#39;s sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression, including, but not limited to, causing, attempting to cause, threatening to cause, or participating in an act of hate violence on the basis of sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression</li>
