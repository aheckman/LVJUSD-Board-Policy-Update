## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy and accompanying administrative regulation apply to the administration of medication to students pursuant to Education Code 49414, 49414.1, 49414.3, 49414.5, 49414.7, 49414.8, 49423, 49423.1 and 49468-49468.5 and the permissive guidelines in 5 CCR 600-611.This policy and regulation do not address situations in which a district might be engaged in a collaborative arrangement with another entity for the provision of school health services to students; see BP/AR 5141.6 - School Health Services.
The Governing Board believes that regular school attendance is critical to student learning and that students who need to take medication prescribed or ordered for them by their authorized health care providers should be able to participate in the educational program.

Any medication prescribed for a student with a disability who is qualified to receive services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 shall be administered in accordance with the student's individualized education program or Section 504 services plan, as applicable.

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 604 authorizes a parent/guardian to administer medication to a child or designate an individual to administer the medication, as specified below. In addition, California law allows students to carry and self-administer medication needed for the treatment or management of certain medical conditions, when the district has received a written request from the student's parent/guardian and written authorization from the student's authorized health care provider, as specified in the accompanying administrative regulation. Students have legal authorization to self-administer diabetes medication pursuant to Education Code 49414.5, auto-injectable epinephrine for anaphylactic reactions pursuant to Education Code 49423, and inhaled asthma medication pursuant to Education Code 49423.1. Pursuant to 5 CCR 605, districts may choose to allow students to carry and self-administer other types of medication beyond those specifically authorized by the Education Code.
For the administration of medication to other students during school or school-related activities, the Superintendent or designee shall develop protocols which shall include options for allowing parents/guardians to administer medication to their child at school, designate other individuals to do so on their behalf, and, with the student's authorized health care provider's approval, request the district's permission for the student to self-administer a medication or self-monitor and/or self-test for a medical condition. Such processes shall be implemented in a manner that preserves campus security, minimizes instructional interruptions, and promotes student safety and privacy.

The Superintendent or designee shall make epinephrine auto-injectors available at each school for providing emergency medical aid to any person suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an anaphylactic reaction.  (Education Code 49414)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. The district is authorized, but not required, to make certain medications available on its school sites for providing emergency medical aid to students. For example, pursuant to Education Code 49414.3 and, as added by AB 1283 (Ch. 574, Statutes of 2023), Education Code 49414.7, the district is permitted to make emergency naloxone hydrochloride or other opioid antagonist and emergency stock albuterol inhalers available at its schools, for providing emergency medical aid to any person suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from opioid overdose or respiratory distress. The following paragraph may be revised to specify medications that the district, in its discretion, has chosen to stock for use on its school sites. In choosing to make such medications available, the district should be aware of the possibility of increased liability and should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel accordingly.
In accordance with law, the Superintendent or designee may make naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist and stock albuterol inhalers available at each school for providing emergency medical aid to any person suffering or reasonably believed to be suffering from opioid overdose or respiratory distress.  (Education Code 49414.3, 49414.7)

CSBA NOTE: Although federal law (21 USC 812, 844) prohibits the possession of cannabis, even by medical users, state law allows persons under the age of 18 to use and possess cannabis for medical use. Pursuant to Education Code 49414.1, the Governing Board is authorized to adopt a policy that allows parents/guardians to administer medicinal cannabis to their child at school. Education Code 49414.1 does not permit or require school personnel to administer medicinal cannabis.Option 1 is for use by districts that choose to adopt a policy allowing parent/guardian administration of medicinal cannabis at school. Because of the conflict between state and federal law, districts considering adoption of such policy should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel regarding possible ramifications. Education Code 49414.1 authorizes the Board to subsequently amend or rescind the policy for any reason, including, but not limited to, if the district is at risk of, or has lost, federal funding as a result of the policy.Option 2 is for use by districts that choose to prohibit the administration of medicinal cannabis at school.
OPTION 1:  The parent/guardian of a student who is a qualified patient pursuant to Health and Safety Code 11362.7-11362.85 may administer medicinal cannabis, excluding medicinal cannabis or cannabis products in a smokeable or vapeable form, to the student at a school site. School personnel are not authorized to administer medicinal cannabis to a student.  (Education Code 49414.1)

CSBA NOTE: If the Board chooses Option 1, Education Code 49414.1 mandates that the policy include the following requirements.
Before administering medicinal cannabis at a school site, the parent/guardian shall provide to the principal or designee a valid written medical recommendation for the student to be given medicinal cannabis, which shall be kept on file at the school. The parent/guardian shall sign in at the school site before administering the medication, and shall not administer the medication in a manner that disrupts the educational environment or exposes other students. After the parent/guardian administers the medication, the parent/guardian shall remove any remaining medicinal cannabis from the school site.  (Education Code 49414.1)

END OF OPTION 1

OPTION 2:  Because of the conflict between state and federal law regarding the legality of medicinal cannabis, the Board prohibits the administration of medicinal cannabis to students on school grounds by parents/guardians or school personnel.

END OF OPTION 2

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph applies to all districts and may be revised to reflect district practice. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that a district's emergency and disaster preparedness plan include procedures for dealing with medical emergencies, such as a pandemic flu outbreak or public disaster. See BP/AR 3516 - Emergencies and Disaster Preparedness Plan and BP/AR 5141.22 - Infectious Diseases.
The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with city and county emergency responders, including local public health administrators, to design procedures or measures for addressing an emergency such as a public disaster or epidemic.

Administration of Medication by School Personnel

CSBA NOTE: Various provisions of state law allow districts to train nonmedical district employees (i.e., those who do not possess a medical license) to provide medical assistance to students at school when a credentialed school nurse or other licensed individual is unavailable. For example, Education Code 49414, 49414.3, 49414.5, 49414.7, 49414.8, 49423, 49423.1, and 49468.2 specifically authorize the use of trained, unlicensed school employees to administer medications to students suffering from allergic reactions, opioid overdose, severe hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, asthma, or seizures. Moreover, in American Nurses Association v. Torlakson, the California Supreme Court held that, as with other prescription medications, state law permits trained, unlicensed school personnel to administer insulin to students where a physician has determined that unlicensed school personnel may safely and appropriately administer the medication. The medication must be administered in accordance with a written health care provider statement and parental consent.Education Code 49426.5, as added by AB 1722 (Ch. 853, Statutes of 2023), authorizes the district to hire a licensed vocational nurse following Board approval that a diligent search was conducted for a credentialed school nurse. Upon hiring a licensed vocational nurse, the district is required to certify to the California Department of Education that a search was properly conducted. A hired vocational nurse is required to be supervised by a credentialed school nurse employed as a school nurse at the district or at another local educational agency.
When allowed by law, medication prescribed to a student by an authorized health care provider may be administered by a school nurse or, when a school nurse or other medically licensed person is unavailable and the physician has authorized administration of medication by unlicensed personnel for a particular student, by other designated school personnel with appropriate training. School nurses and other designated school personnel shall administer medications to students in accordance with law, Board policy, administrative regulation, and, as applicable, the written statement provided by the student's parent/guardian and authorized health care provider. Such personnel shall be afforded appropriate liability protection.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that school personnel designated to administer any medication receive appropriate training and, as necessary, retraining from qualified medical personnel before any medication is administered. At a minimum, the training shall cover how and when such medication should be administered, the recognition of symptoms and treatment, emergency follow-up procedures, and the proper documentation and storage of medication. Such trained, unlicensed designated school personnel shall be supervised by, and provided with immediate communication access to, a school nurse, physician, or other appropriate individual.

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain documentation of the training and ongoing supervision, as well as annual written verification of competency of other designated school personnel.

Before administering medicinal cannabis at a school site, the parent/guardian shall provide to the principal or designee a valid written medical recommendation for the student to be given medicinal cannabis, which shall be kept on file at the school. The parent/guardian shall sign in at the school site before administering the medication, and shall not administer the medication in a manner that disrupts the educational environment or exposes other students.

<strong>Administration of Medication by School Personnel</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='YNg653' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Various provisions of state law allow districts to train nonmedical district employees (i.e., those who do not possess a medical license) to provide medical assistance to students at school when a credentialed school nurse or other licensed individual is unavailable. For example, Education Code 49414, 49414.3, 49414.5, 49414.7, 49414.8, 49423, 49423.1, and 49468.2 specifically authorize the use of trained, unlicensed school employees to administer medications to students suffering from allergic reactions, opioid overdose, severe hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, asthma, or seizures. Moreover, in American Nurses Association v. Torlakson, the California Supreme Court held that, as with other prescription medications, state law permits trained, unlicensed school personnel to administer insulin to students where a physician has determined that unlicensed school personnel may safely and appropriately administer the medication. The medication must be administered in accordance with a written health care provider statement and parental consent.<br><br>Education Code 49426.5, as added by AB 1722 (Ch. 853, Statutes of 2023), authorizes the district to hire a licensed vocational nurse following Board approval that a diligent search was conducted for a credentialed school nurse. Upon hiring a licensed vocational nurse, the district is required to certify to the California Department of Education that a search was properly conducted. A hired vocational nurse is required to be supervised by a credentialed school nurse employed as a school nurse at the district or at another local educational agency.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="INDMNw6" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22INDMNw6%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22YNg653%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1710210407%2C%22text%22%3A%22Various%20provisions%20of%20state%20law%20allow%20districts%20to%20train%20nonmedical%20district%20employees%20%28i.e.%2C%20those%20who%20do%20not%20possess%20a%20medical%20license%29%20to%20provide%20medical%20assistance%20to%20students%20at%20school%20when%20a%20credentialed%20school%20nurse%20or%20other%20licensed%20individual%20is%20unavailable.%20For%20example%2C%20Education%20Code%2049414%2C%2049414.3%2C%2049414.5%2C%2049414.7%2C%2049414.8%2C%2049423%2C%2049423.1%2C%20and%2049468.2%20specifically%20authorize%20the%20use%20of%20trained%2C%20unlicensed%20school%20employees%20to%20administer%20medications%20to%20students%20suffering%20from%20allergic%20reactions%2C%20opioid%20overdose%2C%20severe%20hypoglycemia%2C%20respiratory%20distress%2C%20asthma%2C%20or%20seizures.%20Moreover%2C%20in%20American%20Nurses%20Association%20v.%20Torlakson%2C%20the%20California%20Supreme%20Court%20held%20that%2C%20as%20with%20other%20prescription%20medications%2C%20state%20law%20permits%20trained%2C%20unlicensed%20school%20personnel%20to%20administer%20insulin%20to%20students%20where%20a%20physician%20has%20determined%20that%20unlicensed%20school%20personnel%20may%20safely%20and%20appropriately%20administer%20the%20medication.%20The%20medication%20must%20be%20administered%20in%20accordance%20with%20a%20written%20health%20care%20provider%20statement%20and%20parental%20consent.%5Cn%5CnEducation%20Code%2049426.5%2C%20as%20added%20by%20AB%201722%20%28Ch.%20853%2C%20Statutes%20of%202023%29%2C%20authorizes%20the%20district%20to%20hire%20a%20licensed%20vocational%20nurse%20following%20Board%20approval%20that%20a%20diligent%20search%20was%20conducted%20for%20a%20credentialed%20school%20nurse.%20Upon%20hiring%20a%20licensed%20vocational%20nurse%2C%20the%20district%20is%20required%20to%20certify%20to%20the%20California%20Department%20of%20Education%20that%20a%20search%20was%20properly%20conducted.%20A%20hired%20vocational%20nurse%20is%20required%20to%20be%20supervised%20by%20a%20credentialed%20school%20nurse%20employed%20as%20a%20school%20nurse%20at%20the%20district%20or%20at%20another%20local%20educational%20agency.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-INDMNw6" title="CSBA NOTE: Various provisions of state law allow d..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
When allowed by law, medication prescribed to a student by an authorized health care provider may be administered by a school nurse or, when a school nurse or other medically licensed person is unavailable and the physician has authorized administration of medication by unlicensed personnel for a particular student, by other designated school personnel with appropriate training. School nurses and other designated school personnel shall administer medications to students in accordance with law, Board policy, administrative regulation, and, as applicable, the written statement provided by the student&#39;s parent/guardian and authorized health care provider. Such personnel shall be afforded appropriate liability protection.<br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that school personnel designated to administer any medication receive appropriate training and, as necessary, retraining from qualified medical personnel before any medication is administered. At a minimum, the training shall cover how and when such medication should be administered, the recognition of symptoms and treatment, emergency follow-up procedures, and the proper documentation and storage of medication. Such trained, unlicensed designated school personnel shall be supervised by, and provided with immediate communication access to, a school nurse, physician, or other appropriate individual.<br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain documentation of the training and ongoing supervision, as well as annual written verification of competency of other designated school personnel.</body>
