## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that its primary responsibility is to act in the best interests of every student in the District. The Board also has major commitments to parents/guardians, all members of the community, employees, the state of California, laws pertaining to public education, and established policies of the District. To maximize Board effectiveness and public confidence in District governance, Board members are expected to govern responsibly and hold themselves to the highest standards of ethical conduct.

The Board expects its members to work with each other and the Superintendent to ensure that a high-quality education is provided to each student.  Each individual Board member shall:


	Keep learning and achievement for all students as the primary focus
	 
	Value, support and advocate for public education
	 
	Recognize and respect differences of perspective and style on the Board and among staff, students, parents and the community
	 
	Act with dignity, and understand the implications of demeanor and behavior
	 
	Keep confidential matters confidential
	 
	Participate in professional development and commit the time and energy necessary to be an informed and effective leader
	 
	Understand the distinctions between Board and staff roles, and refrain from performing management functions that are the responsibility of the Superintendent and staff
	 
	Understand that authority rests with the Board as a whole and not with individuals

Board members also shall assume collective responsibility for building unity and creating a positive organizational culture. To operate effectively, the Board shall have a unity of purpose and: 


	Keep the District focused on learning and achievement for all students
	 
	Communicate a common vision
	 
	Operate openly, with trust and integrity
	 
	Govern in a dignified and professional manner, treating everyone with civility and respect
	 
	Govern within Board-adopted policies and procedures
	 
	Take collective responsibility for the Board's performance
	 
	Periodically evaluate its own effectiveness
	 
	Ensure opportunities for the diverse range of views in the community to inform Board deliberations
