## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35035 gives the Superintendent or designee the authority to assign personnel subject to Governing Board approval. The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.Staff assignments must be reported to the California Department of Education through the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data Systems (CALPADS) Professional Assignment Information Form.
In order to serve the best interests of students and the educational program, the Governing Board authorizes the Superintendent or designee to assign certificated personnel to positions for which they are qualified pursuant to their certification, preparation, professional experience, and aptitude.

Teachers may be assigned to any school within the district in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement or Board policy.

Assignment to Courses/Classes

The Superintendent or designee shall assign teachers based on the grade level and subject matter authorized by their credentials.

When there is no credential authorization requirement for teaching an elective course, the Superintendent or designee shall select the credentialed teacher whose knowledge and skills best prepare the teacher to provide instruction in that subject.

CSBA NOTE: The Commission on Teacher Credentialing's (CTC) Administrator's Assignment Manual describes "local teaching assignment options" available to districts when assigning a teacher outside the credential authorization of the teacher.  See the accompanying administrative regulation for requirements pertaining to assignments to departmentalized classes in grades K-12 (Education Code 44258.3) or elective courses (Education Code 44258.7).According to the CTC manual, it is inappropriate to use a local teaching assignment option for an individual who holds an emergency permit, provisional internship permit (PIP), or short-term staff permit (STSP). For information about the circumstances under which persons holding these permits may be employed, see BP/AR 4112.2 - Certification. If a district uses a local teaching assignment option for a holder of an intern credential, the CTC cautions that the district must ensure that the individual meets the specific requirements of the teaching assignment option as well as the requirements of the intern credential; see BP/AR 4112.21 - Interns for further information about intern programs.The CTC manual indicates that a district may use the options at its discretion. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect options available in the district.
When specifically authorized by law or regulation, the Superintendent or designee may, with the teacher's consent, assign a teacher to a position outside the teacher's credential authorization in accordance with the local teaching assignment options described in the Commission on Teacher Credentialing's (CTC) Administrator's Assignment Manual.  Such assignments shall be annually approved by Board resolution. In such cases, the Superintendent or designee shall reference in district records the statute or regulation under which the assignment is authorized.

If at any time a certificated employee is required by the district to accept an assignment which the employee believes is not legally authorized by the employee's credential, the employee shall notify the Superintendent or designee, in writing, of the misassignment. Within 15 working days, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the employee of the legality of the assignment.  If no action is taken by the district, the employee shall provide written notification to the County Superintendent of Schools.  No adverse action shall be taken against an employee who files a notice of misassignment.  (Education Code 44258.9)

Vacancies and Misassignments

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44258.9, as amended by AB 1219 (Ch. 782, Statutes of 2019), requires that the assignments of certificated employees at all schools be monitored annually.  Pursuant to Education Code 44258.9, the County Superintendent of Schools is responsible for the monitoring of teacher assignments in districts. However, CTC is designated as the monitoring authority for any district that operates within a city or county in which there is a single district. Such districts should modify the following section accordingly to reflect CTC as the monitoring authority.Pursuant to Education Code 44258.9, CTC administers a State Assignment Accountability System which annually produces a data file of vacant positions and assignments that do not have a clear match of credential to assignment. As provided below, CTC will notify districts of an opportunity to review the initial data, and districts may submit documentation within 60 days to correct any errors. Within 90 days of CTC's notification (i.e., 30 days after the deadline for the district's review), the County Superintendent must review the data and any additional documentation submitted by the district and make a determination of potential misassignments and vacant positions. Beginning in 2020-21, CTC will report the misassignment and vacancy data on its web site.
Annually, the district shall review potential misassignments and vacant positions throughout the district. Upon receiving notification from CTC of the availability of data regarding potential misassignments and vacant positions in the district, the Superintendent shall review the data within 60 days. When necessary, the Superintendent or designee may respond by submitting additional documentation to the County Superintendent showing that an employee is legally authorized for an assignment and/or that a position identified as vacant was miscoded and a legally authorized employee is assigned to the position.  (Education Code 44258.9)

If the district subsequently receives, within 90 days of CTC's initial notification, a notification from the County Superintendent indicating that a certificated employee in the district is assigned to a position for which the employee has no legal authorization, the district shall correct the assignment within 30 calendar days.  (Education Code 44258.9)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44258.9, the district serves as the monitoring authority for any charter school it has authorized.  However, pursuant to Education Code 44258.10, the district is not required to advise the charter school administrator to correct the misassignment of any teachers employed by the charter school during the 2019-2020 school year until July 1, 2025.
The district shall serve as the monitoring authority for teacher assignments in any charter school it has authorized, in accordance with Education Code 44258.9-44258.10.

Any complaint alleging teacher misassignment or vacancy shall be filed and addressed through the district's procedures specified in AR 1312.4 - Williams Uniform Complaint Procedures.

The school accountability report card for each school shall include any assignment of teachers outside their subject areas of competence, misassignments, including misassignments of teachers of English learners, and the number of vacant teacher positions for the most recent three-year period.  (Education Code 33126)

Equitable Distribution of Qualified and Experienced Teachers

CSBA NOTE: The following section may be revised to reflect district practice. For districts that receive federal Title I funding, 20 USC 6312 requires that the Title I local educational agency (LEA) plan include a description of how the district will identify and address any disparities that result in low-income or minority students being taught at higher rates than other students by ineffective, inexperienced, or out-of-field teachers. These specific Title I planning requirements are fulfilled through the local control and accountability plan and the consolidated application reporting system.
The Superintendent or designee shall identify and address the equitable distribution of highly qualified and experienced teachers among district schools, including those with higher than average levels of low-income, minority, and/or academically underperforming students. The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board comparisons of teacher qualifications across district schools, including the number of teachers serving under a provisional internship permit, short-term staff permit, intern credential, emergency permit, or credential waiver.

Strategies for ensuring equitable access to experienced teachers may include, but are not limited to, incentives for voluntary transfers, provision of professional development, and/or programs to recruit and retain effective teachers.

These specific Title I planning requirements are fulfilled through the local control and accountability plan and the consolidated application reporting system.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="QMzcOQ4" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22QMzcOQ4%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22gOQ949%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1589576594%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20following%20section%20may%20be%20revised%20to%20reflect%20district%20practice.%20For%20districts%20that%20receive%20federal%20Title%20I%20funding%2C%2020%20USC%206312%20requires%20that%20the%20Title%20I%20local%20educational%20agency%20%28LEA%29%20plan%20include%20a%20description%20of%20how%20the%20district%20will%20identify%20and%20address%20any%20disparities%20that%20result%20in%20low-income%20or%20minority%20students%20being%20taught%20at%20higher%20rates%20than%20other%20students%20by%20ineffective%2C%20inexperienced%2C%20or%20out-of-field%20teachers.%20These%20specific%20Title%20I%20planning%20requirements%20are%20fulfilled%20through%20the%20local%20control%20and%20accountability%20plan%20and%20the%20consolidated%20application%20reporting%20system.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-QMzcOQ4" title="CSBA NOTE: The following section may be revised to..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
The Superintendent or designee shall identify and address the equitable distribution of highly qualified and experienced teachers among district schools, including those with higher than average levels of low-income, minority, and/or academically underperforming students. The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board comparisons of teacher qualifications across district schools, including the number of teachers serving under a provisional internship permit, short-term staff permit, intern credential, emergency permit, or credential waiver.<br>
