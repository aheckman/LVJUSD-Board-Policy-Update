## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant 29 CFR 1910.1030 and 8 CCR 5193, districts must identify employees who have occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens and must establish a written exposure control plan to eliminate or minimize employee exposure to these pathogens. Because safety conditions of employment are within the scope of bargaining pursuant to Government Code 3543.2, the district may want to consult legal counsel regarding whether components of its exposure control plan are subject to collective bargaining.
As part of its commitment to provide a safe and healthy work environment, the Governing Board recognizes the importance of protecting employees from possible infection due to contact with bloodborne pathogens, including, but not limited to, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Superintendent or designee shall establish a written exposure control plan in accordance with state and federal standards for dealing with potentially infectious materials in the workplace.

The exposure control plan shall be consistent with the district's injury and illness prevention program established pursuant to Labor Code 6401.7 and 8 CCR 3203.  (8 CCR 5193)

The Superintendent or designee shall determine which employees have occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens and other potentially infectious materials. In accordance with the district's exposure control plan, employees having occupational exposure shall receive training and be offered the hepatitis B vaccination.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph allows for employees to be included in the training and vaccination program without being classified as having occupational exposure.
Any employee not identified by the Superintendent or designee as having occupational exposure may submit a request to the Superintendent or designee to be included in the training and hepatitis B vaccination program.  The Superintendent or designee may deny a request when there is no reasonable anticipation of contact with any infectious material.

In the event that an employee has an exposure incident, the district shall implement follow-up procedures in accordance with the exposure control plan.  All such incidents shall be evaluated to determine whether changes need to be made in district practices.
