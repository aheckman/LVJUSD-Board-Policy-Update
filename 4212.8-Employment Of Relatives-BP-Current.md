## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 12940 and 2 CCR 7292.5 prohibit a district from making an employment decision or discriminating against a person on the basis of marital status, including the fact that his/her spouse is employed by the district. However, Government Code 12940 does allow employers to reasonably regulate the working of spouses in the same department for reasons of supervision, safety, security, or morale.  Pursuant to Family Code 297.5, registered domestic partners have the same rights, protections, and benefits as spouses under the law.The following optional policy pertains to the employment of relatives or other persons with a relationship to district employees that could cause a conflict of interest and should be modified to reflect district practice. For language regarding the employment of relatives of Governing Board members and other employees designated in the district's conflict of interest code, see BB 9270 - Conflict of Interest.
The Governing Board desires to maximize staff and community confidence in district hiring, promotion, and other employment decisions by promoting practices that are free of conflicts of interest or the appearance of impropriety. 

The Board prohibits the appointment of any person to a position for which his/her relative maintains management, supervisory, evaluation, or promotion responsibilities and prohibits an employee from participating in any decision that singularly applies to any of his/her relatives.

CSBA NOTE: The following definition should be modified to reflect district practice.
For purposes of this policy, relative includes the individual's spouse, domestic partner, parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and the similar family of the individual's spouse or domestic partner.

In addition, the Superintendent or designee may determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether to appoint a person to a position in the same department or facility as an employee with whom he/she maintains a personal relationship when that relationship has the potential to create (1) an adverse impact on supervision, safety, security, or morale of other district employees or (2) a conflict of interest for the individuals involved which is greater because of the their relationship than it would be for another person.

An employee shall notify his/her supervisor within 30 days of any change in his/her circumstances that may constitute a violation of this policy.
