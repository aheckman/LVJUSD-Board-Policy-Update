## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy and accompanying administrative regulation may be used for complaints by employees or job applicants regarding the misapplication of district policies or procedures and for "whistleblower" complaints pursuant to Government Code 53296-53299.  See the accompanying administrative regulation for a list of the types of complaints subject to this procedure as well as a list of the types of complaints for which the law requires that a specific process, such as the Uniform Complaint Procedures, be developed.
The Governing Board recognizes the need to establish a process to allow employees and job applicants to have their concerns heard in an expeditious and unbiased manner. The Board expects that employees will make every effort to resolve complaints and disagreements informally before filing a formal complaint.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44112-44113 and Government Code 53297, the district is prohibited from retaliating against, or otherwise interfering with, an employee for exercising his/her right to file a whistleblower complaint.

However, pursuant to Government Code 53298, the district may take disciplinary action against an employee for disclosing false or confidential information.
The Board prohibits retaliation against complainants. The Superintendent or designee may keep a complainant's identity confidential, except to the extent necessary to investigate the complaint.

All matters related to a complaint shall be kept confidential and any document, communication, or record regarding the complaint shall be placed in a separate file and shall not be placed in an employee's personnel file.
