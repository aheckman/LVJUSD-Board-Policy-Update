Reimbursement for Business/Travel and Conference Expenses

The Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District (LVJUSD or District) may require or allow employees, or other individuals providing pre-approved services on behalf of the District, to travel for work for the purpose of attending conferences, meetings, workshops, and other temporary assignments away from their primary job location. Approved travel shall be necessary for the effective operation of programs and services provided by the District; to support the objectives of the employee's job assignment; to contribute to professional growth opportunities in the District; and/or to directly benefit the District. 

For the purpose of this regulation, a "conference" is a generic term and shall be defined as a formal meeting, workshop, in-service, or convention presented or conducted by a public or private national, state, or regional agency, group, individual expert, or professional organization. In the case of LVJUSD employees, attendance at or participation in actual conferences, workshops, or meetings are expected to provide necessary information or access to expertise required for the District to successfully perform its mandated duties and functions.   

This administrative regulation is designed to address the District's support system for travel and the need to maintain accurate records on all LVJUSD employees' travel. 

Employees, while acting within the course and scope of their District jobs, are responsible and accountable for their time and activities when traveling away from the District. The District system for leave of absences includes provisions for accounting for any time away from the work site for official business travel. This is to clarify employer/employee liability in case of an accident while on authorized travel and to ensure that the District may contact a traveling employee should the need arise. 

It is the responsibility of the authorized traveler to use sound, prudent, and professional judgment when requesting travel approval. It is also the responsibility of the recommending and/or approving authority to determine the need, benefit, and appropriate use of employee time and District funds. 

The department head and/or supervising Assistant Superintendent is responsible for monitoring travel requests of employees assigned to departments under their purview; to ensure that the employee's travel adheres to the appropriate District policies and regulations; and for allowing travel that is within the existing budget. 

Travel

The Travel and Conference Request form must be fully approved at least 30 calendar days in advance of the trip.  When the 30-calendar day requirement is not feasible, an explanation must be provided prior to approval. 

Employees must secure approval from their immediate supervisor.  All anticipated expenses and account codes to which the expenses will be charged must be listed on the travel form. 

Registration, hotel, rental car and airfare should be arranged and paid through the purchase requisition/purchase order process.

*If the meeting is a standalone meeting in Alameda County, and attendance at the meeting is approved by the employee’s supervisor as part of their normal work, then no travel and conference form needs to be completed, unless it requires an overnight stay. 

Travel Out-of-County

An employee may stay at an approved conference hotel using either the conference or government rate, whichever is less.  If unavailable, the employee should ensure that the cost of the hotel being used is less than or equal to the conference hotel.  

The employee should ensure that flight reservations are made as far in advance as possible in order to secure the lowest cost. (See Air Travel below)

Travel Out-of-State

Out-of-state travel must be approved in advance by the District Board of Education.  Allow sufficient time for the item to be uploaded to the Board agenda (at least 10 days in advance of the Board meeting) and approved by the Board.  The Board item should be prepared by the employee’s division. 

Travel approval requests must also be completed and signed by the employee’s immediate supervisor and the Assistant Superintendent who oversees that division.  All anticipated expenses and account codes to which the expenses will be charged must be listed on the travel form. 

An employee may stay at an approved conference hotel using either the conference or government rate, whichever is less.  If unavailable, the employee should ensure that the cost of the hotel being used is less than or equal to the conference hotel.  Exceptions to this, where lodging cannot be found for less than the conference rate, will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

The employee should ensure that flight reservations are made as far in advance as possible in order to secure the lowest cost. (See Air Travel below)

Registration Fees 

Registration for a conference or other expenditures may only occur after approval of the Travel and Conference Request form has been executed. 

Employees are expected to receive approval for announced conferences and meetings far enough in advance so that late registration fees are avoided.

Registration fees should be paid through the purchase requisition/purchase order process.

When submitting a purchase requisition for registration fees, a copy of the registration form with all information filled in must be submitted as backup with the requisition, along with a copy of the completed and approved Travel and Conference Request form. 

Lodging

An employee on approved travel for more than one day may request that the District pay for lodging if the total lodging, parking, and round-trip mileage expense from the District is less than the total parking and mileage expense of daily round trips. Exceptions will be allowed only when daily round trips would cause sufficient inconvenience or hardship to justify the additional expense for lodging. 

An employee on approved travel outside a 50-mile radius of the District or of their residence (whichever is closer to the travel event destination) may request that the District pay for lodging when the activity they are attending begins at or before 8 AM (prior evening lodging) or ends at or after 7 PM (same evening lodging). 

An employee may stay at an approved conference hotel.  If unavailable, the employee should ensure that the cost of the hotel being used is less than or equal to the conference hotel. Exceptions to this, where lodging cannot be found for less than the conference rate, will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis;  Hotel accommodations are to be made and prepaid through the purchase requisition/purchase order process.

Meal Allowances 

The daily reimbursement rate is not to exceed $92; if meals are provided, we will deduct the following from the daily meal amount.  
Meal rates: 


	Breakfast--$23
	 
	Lunch--$26
	 
	Dinner--$38
	 
	Incidental -- $5

These amounts include tax and tip. Any overage is the responsibility of the employee.  Original, itemized receipts showing the date and form of payment, are required and must list the names of employees present at the meal.  No alcohol shall be listed on the receipt.  Only one meal per person will be reimbursed. 

Meals included in airfare, hotel, and conference fees, or otherwise provided, may not be claimed for reimbursement. The same meal may not be claimed more than once on any date. Continental breakfasts of rolls, coffee, and juice are considered full meals. 

Reimbursement will be made upon submission of the Conference/ Travel Reimbursement form with original itemized receipts, within 30 working days from return from the conference; for travel in the month of June, reimbursement forms must be submitted no later than June 30 for fiscal year-end. All receipts must be itemized and original copies attached, otherwise, they will be returned to the requestor and may result in a denial of reimbursement.  If receipts are not submitted for reimbursement within 30 working days of return, they may be rejected. No reimbursement request will be reimbursed after the fiscal year in which it incurred has closed. 

The purchase of alcoholic beverages is prohibited by Education Code Section 32435. 

Bridge Tolls

Receipts are required for non-FasTrak users.  For FasTrak users, FasTrak numbers are required.  Mileage will be reconciled with meeting/conference/workshop location and receipts. 

Internet access

When away from the District and when free wi-fi is not available and the internet is required for business purposes, an employee may purchase internet use. 

Transportation

An employee is expected to travel in the most direct and economical manner. 

Personal Vehicles

Employees may use their personal automobile on official business as long as their vehicle is properly insured with at least the minimum required insurance coverage. Under no circumstances will the use of private aircraft or motorcycles be authorized or approved. 

Mileage Reimbursement

The provisions below apply to all employees entitled to expense reimbursement, except those covered by bargaining unit agreements which provide different provisions. 
An employee can be reimbursed for the use of their personal automobile when used for official business. Mileage reimbursement shall be at the current federal mileage rate. 
All claims for mileage reimbursement shall be submitted on the Mileage Reimbursement form.   

A Google map or similar document showing the mileage to and from the destination shall be attached to the claim form.  A separate reimbursement claim shall be prepared and filed for each approved travel event within 30 working days after the travel occurred. For the month of June, on or before June 30th for fiscal year-end. All claims must be filed in the same fiscal year in which the expense is incurred. Failure to file mileage reimbursement claims in a timely manner may result in a rejection of that claim and no reimbursement processed. 

An employee will be reimbursed for mileage only between points of official business. 

An employee using their automobile on an extended trip outside the county will be reimbursed in an amount that does not exceed the amount that would have been spent if the employee had used coach or economy air transportation or other commercial transportation. 

Reimbursable mileage when travel originates or ends at an employee's residence will be reimbursed at the lesser of the mileage from the residence or the primary work location.  Per IRS Pub 463, mileage between an employee's home and primary work location is considered a commuting expense and not subject to reimbursement. 

Actual and necessary parking expenses will be reimbursed. Receipts are required for this reimbursement. For metered parking, employees are to provide the time, date, location, and/or any other information regarding the amount of the expense for reimbursement. 

Carpooling

The District strongly encourages employees to share transportation whenever it is practical for employees to travel together on official business. 

Rental Cars

An employee shall use a rental car only in cases when other forms of commercial transportation (e.g., shuttle, taxi, Uber, etc.) are unavailable, too costly, or impractical. 
The cost of rental cars or other means of transportation used during leisure time will not be paid by the District. 

Rental cars are to be arranged by purchase order/requisition and with the District’s contracted rental company.

It is required to refuel the vehicle prior to the return of the vehicle, unless it is less expensive to have the rental agency fuel the vehicle.  The receipt for refueling may be submitted for reimbursement. 

Air Travel

Air travel arrangements should be made through a purchase order/requisition.

Employees who need to travel by air and paid by the District shall adhere to the following guidelines: 

	Economy Class Airfare
	 
	Check multiple sources (e.g., internet sites) to find the lowest airfare.
	 
	Plan for Purchasing Dept. to have a minimum of 30 days in advance of flying for a low-fare ticket.
	 
	Find the lowest available fare within a two-hour window from the desired departure/arrival time.
	 
	Find the lowest available fare with direct connections to the destination, if possible

The District will pay for the additional cost of one checked bag.  The District will not pay for early check-in, upgraded seats, or any other additional services. 

It is expected that travelers will exercise prudent judgment when expending public funds. Deviations from the above guidelines will require a written explanation and the approval of the Superintendent and/or the Assistant Superintendent of Business Services. 

Travel Cost Reimbursement

Claims for reimbursements for authorized expenses are subject to the following provisions: 

Documentation

Reimbursement claims shall be prepared on the appropriate Reimbursement Form and accompanied with original, itemized receipts.  Only reimbursable expenses should be listed on the receipt (no “cross-outs”).  For travel that has been approved in accordance with policy and regulations, it is not necessary to use the purchase order/purchase requisition process for reimbursement per the Reimbursement Form.  Conference, workshop, or meeting agendas shall be submitted with reimbursement requests and CalCard statements. 

Timelines 

All claims for reimbursement must be submitted within 30 working days after the conference(s) occurred.  Failure to file a claim for travel expense reimbursement in a timely manner could result in a rejection of that claim and no reimbursement processed. No reimbursement will be approved or processed for expenses incurred during a fiscal year that has closed.

Receipt Requirements
