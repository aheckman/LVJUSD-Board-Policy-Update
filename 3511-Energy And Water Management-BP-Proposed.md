## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the environmental and financial benefits that can be derived from conserving energy, water, and other natural resources, preparing for extreme weather and other natural events, and providing an environment that promotes the health and well-being of students and staff. To support District goals for energy and water management, the Superintendent or designee shall develop a resource management program which may include strategies for implementing effective and sustainable resource use practices, exploring the use of renewable and clean energy technology and/or sources, reducing energy and water consumption, and promoting conservation principles in the educational program.

The Superintendent or designee may solicit input from staff, students, and parents/guardians regarding the District's resource management program. The Superintendent or designee shall provide staff and students with training and guidance on best practices to achieve the District's goals, and may establish a reward program to recognize outstanding accomplishments.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly inspect District facilities, monitor operations, and make recommendations for maintenance and repairs which may help the District reach its conservation and management goals and improve efficiency.

The Superintendent or designee shall make every effort to identify funding opportunities and cost-reducing incentive programs to help the District achieve its conservation and management goals. The District may coordinate with other local or regional entities to capitalize on their expertise and maximize the efficient use of resources, such as through joint or shared use agreements.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board on the District's progress in meeting its conservation and resource management goals.

Emergency Interruption of Services

The Superintendent or designee shall develop a plan to minimize disruption to the educational program in the event of power outages or other emergency interruption of utility services.
