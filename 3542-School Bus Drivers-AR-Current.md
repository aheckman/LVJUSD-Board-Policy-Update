## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation is mandated pursuant to 5 CCR 14103 (see the sections "Training" and "Authority" below) and is for use by districts that employ their own school bus drivers or student activity bus drivers. Districts that contract out for all transportation services may revise this regulation as appropriate to ensure that the contracting firm meets all legal requirements regarding qualifications and responsibilities.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Vehicle Code 12517, school bus drivers are required to possess a commercial driver's license issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), with a special endorsement authorizing school bus operation (indicated by the letter S on the driver's license). District employees who operate 15-passenger vans must possess a commercial driver's license with a passenger transport vehicle (PV) endorsement.In addition, any driver employed to operate a school bus or student activity bus must possess a special certificate from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) permitting such service. Issuance of the certificate is based on successful completion of prescribed examinations conducted by the CHP and compliance with all applicable provisions of the Vehicle Code.
All drivers employed to operate school buses or student activity buses shall possess, and shall retain in their immediate possession while operating the bus, the following documents:  (Vehicle Code 12517, 12517.4)

	A valid driver's license issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for the appropriate class of vehicle to be driven and endorsed for school bus and/or passenger transportation
	 
	A certificate issued by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) which permits the operation of school buses or student activity buses, as applicable

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Vehicle Code 12517.3, applicants for the certificate to drive a school bus or student activity bus must be fingerprinted by the CHP for submission to the Department of Justice (DOJ), or the fingerprinting may be conducted by the district, county office of education, or a public law enforcement agency using an electronic fingerprinting system (LiveScan) with terminals managed by the DOJ. The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that choose to use this method to conduct the fingerprinting themselves.
The Superintendent or designee may use an electronic fingerprinting system, managed by the California Department of Justice, to fingerprint an applicant for an initial certificate to drive a school bus or student activity bus.  (Vehicle Code 12517.3)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Vehicle Code 12517.2, a driver who is initially applying for or seeking renewal of a commercial driver's license or a certificate authorizing him/her to drive a school bus or student activity bus must provide evidence of having obtained a medical examination by a qualified health professional. The report must be on a form approved by the DMV, which is available on its web site.
When initially applying for or renewing a license or certificate to drive a school bus or student activity bus, and annually upon reaching age 65 years, the driver shall submit to the DMV and to the Superintendent or designee a report of a medical examination conducted in accordance with the timelines and procedures specified in Vehicle Code 12517.2.  (Vehicle Code 12517.2; 13 CCR 1234)

Training

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 40082, 40083, and 40085 specify training and experience required for initial and renewed certification as a driver of a school bus or student activity bus. The following section lists additional required and optional training and may be revised to reflect district practice.
In addition to any other training required to obtain or renew the certificate authorizing operation of a school bus or student activity bus, drivers shall receive training which includes, but is not limited to:

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Vehicle Code 12522, as part of the application process for a bus driver certificate, each driver must pass a DMV examination on first aid practices deemed necessary for school bus operators. Toward this end, the district is required to provide instruction for bus drivers on necessary first aid practices.


	First aid practices deemed necessary for school bus drivers, through a course of instruction that prepares drivers to pass the related DMV examination  (Vehicle Code 12522)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 56195.8 mandates that each entity providing special education adopt policy ensuring that school bus drivers have received the training described in item #2 below.

CSBA NOTE: To determine additional topics for professional development, the district might review district data as provided in the optional paragraph below. Training courses and guides are also available through governmental agencies and professional associations. For instance, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration provides an inservice training program for experienced school bus drivers, available on its web site, which addresses driver attitude, student management, highway-rail grade crossing safety, vehicle training, routes, loading and unloading students, driving under adverse weather conditions, emergency evacuation, and transporting students with special needs.
To determine any other needs for professional development, the Superintendent or designee shall periodically review accident reports involving district drivers and may seek input from drivers, district and school administrators, students, and/or other stakeholders on desired topics for professional development.

Authority

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 14103 mandates that the Governing Board adopt rules related to bus driver authority, including, but not limited to, specific administrative regulations related to suspension of riding privileges, and to make them available to parents/guardians, students, teachers, and other interested parties.
