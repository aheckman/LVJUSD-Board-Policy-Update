## Policy Content

Evaluation of certificated employees shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures established in this administrative regulation and applicable collective bargaining agreements. To the extent that any of those provisions conflict, the procedures in the collective bargaining agreement shall be implemented.

The Superintendent or designee shall print and make available to certificated employees written regulations related to the evaluation of their performance in their assigned duties. (Education Code 35171)

Frequency of Evaluations

Each probationary certificated employee shall be evaluated at least once each school year. (Education Code 44664)

Each certificated employee with permanent status shall be evaluated and assessed at least every other year. If the employee receives an unsatisfactory evaluation, he/she shall be annually evaluated until he/she achieves a positive evaluation or is separated from the District. (Education Code 44664)

Alternatively, a permanent employee who has been employed by the District at least 10 years and who was rated in his/her previous evaluation as meeting or exceeding standards shall be evaluated at least every five years, if he/she and the evaluator so agree. Either the evaluator or the employee may withdraw consent for the alternative schedule at any time. (Education Code 44664)

Evaluation Results

Certificated instructional employees shall receive a written copy of their evaluation no later than 30 days before the last scheduled school day of the school year in which the evaluation takes place. Before the last scheduled school day of the school year, the employee and the evaluator shall meet to discuss the evaluation. (Education Code 44663)

Noninstructional certificated staff members employed on a 12-month basis shall receive a copy of their evaluation no later than June 30 of the year in which the evaluation takes place. Before July 30, the employee and the evaluator shall meet to discuss the evaluation. (Education Code 44663)

Instructional and noninstructional certificated employees shall have the right to respond in writing to their evaluation. This response shall become a permanent attachment to the employee's personnel file. (Education Code 44663)

Evaluations shall include recommendations, if necessary, as to areas in need of improvement in the employee's performance. If an employee is not performing satisfactorily according to teaching standards approved by the Board of Education pursuant to Education Code 44662, the Superintendent or designee shall so notify the employee in writing and shall describe the unsatisfactory performance. The Superintendent or designee shall confer with the employee, make specific recommendations as to areas needing improvement, and endeavor to provide assistance to the employee in his/her performance. (Education Code 44664)

The Superintendent or designee may require any certificated employee who receives an unsatisfactory rating in the area of teaching methods or instruction to participate in a program designed to improve appropriate areas of performance and to further student achievement and the District's instructional objectives. (Education Code 44664)
