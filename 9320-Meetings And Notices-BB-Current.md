## Policy Content

Meetings of the Governing Board are conducted for the purpose of accomplishing district business. In accordance with applicable open meeting laws (Brown Act), the Board shall hold its meetings in public and shall conduct closed sessions during such meetings only as authorized by law. To encourage community involvement in the schools, Board meetings shall provide the opportunity for members of the public to directly address the Board. All meetings shall be conducted in accordance with law and the Board's bylaws, policies, and administrative regulations.

A Board meeting exists whenever a majority of Board members gather at the same time and location, including teleconference location as permitted by Government Code 54953, to hear, discuss, deliberate, or take action upon any item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board.  (Government Code 54952.2)

CSBA NOTE: The Brown Act prohibits serial meetings, defined under Government Code 54952.2 as a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of district business.This prohibition against serial meetings also applies to communications via technology. Email exchanges, text/chat threads, or comments posted on a blog or social media account that result in a majority of the Governing Board "discussing among themselves" an item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board could result in a Brown Act violation. Pursuant to Government Code 54952.2, Board members may engage in separate conversations or communications with members of the public on an Internet-based social media platform that is open and accessible to the public as long as a majority of the Board does not use the platform to discuss among themselves business within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board and members do not comment on or use digital icons (e.g., "likes" or emojis) to express reactions to communications made by other Board members. Additionally, a Board member is prohibited from responding directly to any communication from other members of the Board on a social media platform regarding matters that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board. See BB 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications.In 84 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 30 (2001), the Attorney General opined that Government Code 54952.2 prohibits a majority of the Board from sending emails to each other to develop a collective concurrence as to action to be taken by the Board even if the emails are (1) sent to the secretary and chairperson, (2) posted on the district's website, and (3) distributed (in a printed version) at the next meeting. Although the Attorney General recognized that those three conditions would allow the deliberations to be conducted, to some extent, "in public," the emails were prohibited by the Brown Act because all debate would be completed before the meeting and members of the public who did not have Internet access would be excluded from the debate.
In accordance with law and as specified in Board Bylaw 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications, a majority of the Board shall not, outside of an authorized meeting, use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, including social media and other electronic communications, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board.  (Government Code 54952.2)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54952.2 specifies that briefings between staff and Board members are permissible in order to answer questions or to provide information, as long as the briefing is not used to communicate the comments or position of any other Board member.
However, the Superintendent or designee may engage in separate conversations or communications with Board members in order to answer questions or provide information regarding an item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board, as long as that employee or district official does not communicate the comments or position of any Board members to other Board members.  (Government Code 54952.2)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54953.2 requires that all Board meetings meet the protections of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 USC 12132) and implementing regulations. Such protections require the district to ensure that the meeting is accessible to persons with disabilities and, upon request, to provide disability-related accommodations, such as auxiliary aids and services. Auxiliary aids and services may include accommodations at the actual meeting, such as a sign-language interpreter, or accommodations to the supporting documentation, such as Braille translation of the agenda packet. Government Code 54954.2 requires that the agenda specify how, when, and to whom a request for accommodation should be made; see BB 9322 - Agenda/Meeting Materials.Government Code 54953 requires the Board to maintain and implement a procedure for receiving and swiftly resolving requests for reasonable accommodation for individuals with disabilities, consistent with the ADA, and to resolve any doubt in favor of accessibility.
In order to help ensure the participation of individuals with disabilities at Board meetings, the Superintendent or designee shall provide appropriate disability-related accommodations or modifications upon request in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Any doubt about a request for accommodation shall be resolved in favor of accessibility. Notice of the procedure for receiving and resolving such requests for accommodation shall be given in each instance in which notice of the time of a meeting is otherwise given or the agenda for the meeting is otherwise posted.  (Government Code 54953, 54953.2, 54954.1, 54954.2)

Regular Meetings

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35140 and Government Code 54954 mandate the Board to fix the time and location for its regular meetings by rule and regulation.
Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Board shall hold ______ regular meeting(s) each month starting at _________p.m. on the ________________________________(day(s)) of the month at ____________________________________ (name of facility and address).

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54954.2, the agenda for a regular meeting must be posted at least 72 hours prior to the meeting, at a location that is freely accessible to the public. Government Code 54954.2 also requires that the agenda be posted on the district's website. Other posting requirements may apply where Board members are participating by teleconference as specified below.The Attorney General has determined in 78 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 327 (1995) that weekend hours may be counted as part of the 72-hour period for posting of the agenda prior to a regular meeting. In the same opinion, the Attorney General found that the term "freely accessible" requires that the agenda be posted in a location where it can be read by the public at any time during the 72 hours immediately preceding the meeting. For example, if a building where the agenda is posted is closed during the evening hours, the agenda must also be posted in a location accessible during evening hours, such as a lighted display case outside of the building. The Attorney General also opined in 88 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 218 (2005) that the agenda may be posted on a touch screen electronic kiosk, in lieu of a paper copy on a bulletin board, as long as the kiosk is accessible without charge to the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
At least 72 hours prior to a regular meeting, the agenda shall be posted at one or more locations freely accessible to members of the public and on the district's website.  (Government Code 54954.2)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54957.5, the agenda must list the address where the public can inspect agenda materials that are distributed to Board members less than 72 hours before a regular meeting. Pursuant to Government Code 54957.5, when agenda materials are distributed to all or a majority of the Board less than 72 hours before a regular meeting and outside of regular business hours, the materials may be posted on the district's website in satisfaction of the Brown Act if specified requirements are met. Districts with questions regarding this exception are encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel. Also see BB 9322 - Agenda/Meeting Materials.In addition, pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Government Code 7920.000 - 7930.215), agenda materials related to an open session of a Board's regular meeting are "public records" and are subject to inspection by any member of the public as specified in BP/AR 1340 - Access to District Records.
Consistent with Government Code 54957.5 and Board Bylaw 9322 - Agenda/Meeting Materials, whenever agenda materials relating to an open session of a regular meeting are distributed to the Board less than 72 hours before the meeting, the Superintendent or designee shall make the materials available for public inspection at a public office or location designated for that purpose. The records shall be posted on the district website at the time the materials are distributed to all or a majority of the Board if distributed outside of business hours.

Special Meetings

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54956 permits the Board president or a majority of the Board to call a special meeting. When a majority of the Board has requested a special meeting on the same specific topic, the Superintendent or designee shall inform the Board and the meeting shall be organized and called. If an individual Board member desires a special meeting on a specific topic that has not been called by the Board president, the Board member should inform the Superintendent or designee rather than other Board members in order to comply with the Brown Act.
Special meetings of the Board may be called at any time by the presiding officer or a majority of the Board members on any topic within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board unless otherwise prohibited by law or as specified in BB 9323.2 - Actions by the Board.  (Government Code 54956)

At least 24 hours before the time of the meeting, written notice of special meetings shall be delivered personally or by any other means to all Board members and the local media who have requested such notice in writing. The notice also shall be posted on the district's website, and, at least 24 hours before the time of the meeting, in a location freely accessible to the public. The notice shall specify the time and location of the meeting and the business to be transacted or discussed. No other business shall be considered at this meeting.  (Education Code 35144; Government Code 54956)

Any Board member may waive the 24-hour written notice requirement prior to the time of the meeting by filing a written waiver of notice with the clerk or secretary of the Board or by being present at the meeting at the time it convenes.  (Education Code 35144; Government Code 54956)

Every notice of a special meeting shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the Board concerning any item that has been described in the meeting notice, before or during the item's consideration.  (Government Code 54954.3)

Emergency Meetings

In the case of an emergency situation for which prompt action is necessary due to the disruption or threatened disruption of public facilities, the Board may hold an emergency meeting without complying with the 24-hour notice and/or 24-hour posting requirement for special meetings pursuant to Government Code 54956.  (Government Code 54956.5)

The Board may meet in closed session during emergency meetings so long as two-thirds of the members present at the meeting agree or, if less than two-thirds of the members are present, by unanimous vote of the members present.  (Government Code 54956.5)

The Board shall comply with all other requirements for special meetings during an emergency meeting.  (Government Code 54956.5)

Except in the case of a dire emergency, the Board president or designee shall give notice of the emergency meeting by telephone at least one hour before the meeting to the local media that have requested notice of special meetings. All telephone numbers provided by the media in the most recent request for notification shall be exhausted. If telephone services are not functioning, the notice requirement of one hour is waived and, as soon after the meeting as possible, the Board shall notify those media representatives of the meeting and shall describe the purpose of the meeting and any action taken by the Board. In the case of a dire emergency, the Board president or designee shall give such notice at or near the time notification is given to the other members of the Board. (Government Code 54956.5)

The minutes of the meeting, a list of persons the Board president or designee notified or attempted to notify, a copy of the roll call vote, and any actions taken at the meeting shall be posted for at least 10 days in a public place as soon after the meeting as possible.  (Government Code 54956.5)

An emergency means a work stoppage, crippling activity, or other activity that severely impairs public health and/or safety as determined by a majority of the members of the Board.  (Government Code 54956.5)

A dire emergency means a crippling disaster, mass destruction, terrorist act, or threatened terrorist activity that poses peril so immediate and significant that requiring the Board to provide one-hour notice before holding an emergency meeting may endanger the public health and/or safety as determined by a majority of the members of the Board.  (Government Code 54956.5)

Adjourned/Continued Meetings

The Board may adjourn/continue any regular or special meeting to a later time and location that shall be specified in the order of adjournment. Less than a quorum of the Board may adjourn/continue such a meeting. If no Board members are present, the secretary or the clerk may declare the meeting adjourned/continued to a later time and location and shall give notice in the same manner required for special meetings.  (Government Code 54955)

Within 24 hours after the time of adjournment/continuance, a copy of the order or notice of adjournment/continuance shall be conspicuously posted on or near the door of the location where the meeting was held.  (Government Code 54955)

Study Sessions, Retreats, Public Forums, and Discussion Meetings

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Government Code 54954.2, the Board must still comply with the public notice requirements when holding a study session, retreat, public forum or other such meeting.
The Board may convene a study session or public forum to study an issue in more detail or to receive information from staff or feedback from members of the public. The Board may also convene a retreat or discussion meeting to discuss Board roles and relationships. Any such meeting, regardless of title or topic, shall be held as a regular or special meeting, as appropriate, and shall comply with all other requirements for regular or special meetings.  (Government Code 54956)

Therefore, it is recommended that districts consider including teleconference access, as described below, as part of every meeting. Districts are also encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel to determine the best means of complying with Government Code 54953.

<body aria-readonly="false" data-gramm_editor="false" data-wsc-instance="true">Meetings of the Governing Board are conducted for the purpose of accomplishing district business. In accordance with applicable open meeting laws (Brown Act), the Board shall hold its meetings in public and shall conduct closed sessions during such meetings only as authorized by law. To encourage community involvement in the schools, Board meetings shall provide the opportunity for members of the public to directly address the Board. All meetings shall be conducted in accordance with law and the Board&#39;s bylaws, policies, and administrative regulations.<br>
<br>
A Board meeting exists whenever a majority of Board members gather at the same time and location, including teleconference location as permitted by Government Code 54953, to hear, discuss, deliberate, or take action upon any item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board. &nbsp;(Government Code 54952.2)<br>
<br>
<div id='cMQ494' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The Brown Act prohibits serial meetings, defined under Government Code 54952.2 as a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of district business.<br><br>This prohibition against serial meetings also applies to communications via technology. Email exchanges, text/chat threads, or comments posted on a blog or social media account that result in a majority of the Governing Board "discussing among themselves" an item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board could result in a Brown Act violation. Pursuant to Government Code 54952.2, Board members may engage in separate conversations or communications with members of the public on an Internet-based social media platform that is open and accessible to the public as long as a majority of the Board does not use the platform to discuss among themselves business within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board and members do not comment on or use digital icons (e.g., "likes" or emojis) to express reactions to communications made by other Board members. Additionally, a Board member is prohibited from responding directly to any communication from other members of the Board on a social media platform regarding matters that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board. See BB 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications.<br><br>In 84 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 30 (2001), the Attorney General opined that Government Code 54952.2 prohibits a majority of the Board from sending emails to each other to develop a collective concurrence as to action to be taken by the Board even if the emails are (1) sent to the secretary and chairperson, (2) posted on the district's website, and (3) distributed (in a printed version) at the next meeting. Although the Attorney General recognized that those three conditions would allow the deliberations to be conducted, to some extent, "in public," the emails were prohibited by the Brown Act because all debate would be completed before the meeting and members of the public who did not have Internet access would be excluded from the debate.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="NTUyOA0" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22NTUyOA0%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22cMQ494%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1710352252%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20Brown%20Act%20prohibits%20serial%20meetings%2C%20defined%20under%20Government%20Code%2054952.2%20as%20a%20series%20of%20communications%20of%20any%20kind%2C%20directly%20or%20through%20intermediaries%2C%20to%20discuss%2C%20deliberate%2C%20or%20take%20action%20on%20any%20item%20of%20district%20business.%5Cn%5CnThis%20prohibition%20against%20serial%20meetings%20also%20applies%20to%20communications%20via%20technology.%20Email%20exchanges%2C%20text/chat%20threads%2C%20or%20comments%20posted%20on%20a%20blog%20or%20social%20media%20account%20that%20result%20in%20a%20majority%20of%20the%20Governing%20Board%20%5C%22discussing%20among%20themselves%5C%22%20an%20item%20within%20the%20subject%20matter%20jurisdiction%20of%20the%20Board%20could%20result%20in%20a%20Brown%20Act%20violation.%20Pursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2054952.2%2C%20Board%20members%20may%20engage%20in%20separate%20conversations%20or%20communications%20with%20members%20of%20the%20public%20on%20an%20Internet-based%20social%20media%20platform%20that%20is%20open%20and%20accessible%20to%20the%20public%20as%20long%20as%20a%20majority%20of%20the%20Board%20does%20not%20use%20the%20platform%20to%20discuss%20among%20themselves%20business%20within%20the%20subject%20matter%20jurisdiction%20of%20the%20Board%20and%20members%20do%20not%20comment%20on%20or%20use%20digital%20icons%20%28e.g.%2C%20%5C%22likes%5C%22%20or%20emojis%29%20to%20express%20reactions%20to%20communications%20made%20by%20other%20Board%20members.%20Additionally%2C%20a%20Board%20member%20is%20prohibited%20from%20responding%20directly%20to%20any%20communication%20from%20other%20members%20of%20the%20Board%20on%20a%20social%20media%20platform%20regarding%20matters%20that%20are%20within%20the%20subject%20matter%20jurisdiction%20of%20the%20Board.%20See%20BB%209012%20-%20Board%20Member%20Electronic%20Communications.%5Cn%5CnIn%2084%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%2030%20%282001%29%2C%20the%20Attorney%20General%20opined%20that%20Government%20Code%2054952.2%20prohibits%20a%20majority%20of%20the%20Board%20from%20sending%20emails%20to%20each%20other%20to%20develop%20a%20collective%20concurrence%20as%20to%20action%20to%20be%20taken%20by%20the%20Board%20even%20if%20the%20emails%20are%20%281%29%20sent%20to%20the%20secretary%20and%20chairperson%2C%20%282%29%20posted%20on%20the%20district%27s%20website%2C%20and%20%283%29%20distributed%20%28in%20a%20printed%20version%29%20at%20the%20next%20meeting.%20Although%20the%20Attorney%20General%20recognized%20that%20those%20three%20conditions%20would%20allow%20the%20deliberations%20to%20be%20conducted%2C%20to%20some%20extent%2C%20%5C%22in%20public%2C%5C%22%20the%20emails%20were%20prohibited%20by%20the%20Brown%20Act%20because%20all%20debate%20would%20be%20completed%20before%20the%20meeting%20and%20members%20of%20the%20public%20who%20did%20not%20have%20Internet%20access%20would%20be%20excluded%20from%20the%20debate.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-NTUyOA0" title="CSBA NOTE: The Brown Act prohibits serial meetings..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

In the same opinion, the Attorney General found that the term "freely accessible" requires that the agenda be posted in a location where it can be read by the public at any time during the 72 hours immediately preceding the meeting. For example, if a building where the agenda is posted is closed during the evening hours, the agenda must also be posted in a location accessible during evening hours, such as a lighted display case outside of the building. The Attorney General also opined in 88 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 218 (2005) that the agenda may be posted on a touch screen electronic kiosk, in lieu of a paper copy on a bulletin board, as long as the kiosk is accessible without charge to the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="NTUyOA4" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22NTUyOA4%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22QOA498%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1710352347%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2054954.2%2C%20the%20agenda%20for%20a%20regular%20meeting%20must%20be%20posted%20at%20least%2072%20hours%20prior%20to%20the%20meeting%2C%20at%20a%20location%20that%20is%20freely%20accessible%20to%20the%20public.%20Government%20Code%2054954.2%20also%20requires%20that%20the%20agenda%20be%20posted%20on%20the%20district%27s%20website.%20Other%20posting%20requirements%20may%20apply%20where%20Board%20members%20are%20participating%20by%20teleconference%20as%20specified%20below.%5Cn%5CnThe%20Attorney%20General%20has%20determined%20in%2078%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%20327%20%281995%29%20that%20weekend%20hours%20may%20be%20counted%20as%20part%20of%20the%2072-hour%20period%20for%20posting%20of%20the%20agenda%20prior%20to%20a%20regular%20meeting.%20In%20the%20same%20opinion%2C%20the%20Attorney%20General%20found%20that%20the%20term%20%5C%22freely%20accessible%5C%22%20requires%20that%20the%20agenda%20be%20posted%20in%20a%20location%20where%20it%20can%20be%20read%20by%20the%20public%20at%20any%20time%20during%20the%2072%20hours%20immediately%20preceding%20the%20meeting.%20For%20example%2C%20if%20a%20building%20where%20the%20agenda%20is%20posted%20is%20closed%20during%20the%20evening%20hours%2C%20the%20agenda%20must%20also%20be%20posted%20in%20a%20location%20accessible%20during%20evening%20hours%2C%20such%20as%20a%20lighted%20display%20case%20outside%20of%20the%20building.%20The%20Attorney%20General%20also%20opined%20in%2088%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%20218%20%282005%29%20that%20the%20agenda%20may%20be%20posted%20on%20a%20touch%20screen%20electronic%20kiosk%2C%20in%20lieu%20of%20a%20paper%20copy%20on%20a%20bulletin%20board%2C%20as%20long%20as%20the%20kiosk%20is%20accessible%20without%20charge%20to%20the%20public%2024%20hours%20a%20day%2C%20seven%20days%20a%20week.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-NTUyOA4" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54954.2, th..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
