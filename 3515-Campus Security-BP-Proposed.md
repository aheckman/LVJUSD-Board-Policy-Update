## Policy Content

The Board of Education is committed to providing a school environment that promotes the safety of students, staff, and visitors to school grounds.  The Board also recognizes the importance of protecting District property, facilities, and equipment from vandalism and theft.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop campus security procedures, which may be included in the District's comprehensive safety plan and/or site-level safety plans.  Such procedures shall be regularly reviewed to reflect changed circumstances and to assess their effectiveness in achieving safe school objectives.

Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall regularly review current guidance regarding cybersecurity and digital media awareness and incorporate recommended practices into the District's processes and procedures related to the protection of the District's network infrastructure, and the monitoring and response to suspicious and/or threatening digital media content.

Reporting Threats

Any certificated or classified employee, or other school official, whose duties bring the employee or other school official in contact on a regular basis with students in any of grades 6-12, as part of a middle of high school, who are alerted to or observe any threat or perceived threat of a homicidal act, as defined, shall immediately report the threat or perceived threat to law enforcement in accordance with Education Code 49393.  (Education Code 49390, 49393)

Threat or perceived threat means any writing or action of a student that creates a reasonable suspicion that the student is preparing to commit a homicidal act related to school or a school activity. This may include possession, use, or depictions of firearms, ammunition, shootings, or targets in association with infliction of physical harm, destruction, or death in a social media post, journal, class note, or other media associated with the student. It may also include a warning by a parent, student, or other individual.

Additionally, anyone who receives or learns of a health or safety threat related to school or a school activity is encouraged to report the threat to a school or District administrator.

Surveillance Systems

In consultation with the District's school site council, safety planning committee, other relevant stakeholders, and staff, the Superintendent or designee shall identify appropriate locations for the placement of surveillance cameras.  Cameras shall not be placed in areas where students, staff, or community members have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Any audio capability on the District's surveillance equipment shall be disabled so that sounds are not recorded.

Prior to the operation of the surveillance system, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that signs are posted at conspicuous and targeted locations around school buildings and grounds.  These signs shall state that the facility uses video surveillance equipment for security purposes and that the equipment may or may not be actively monitored at any time.  The Superintendent or designee shall also provide prior written notice to students and parents/guardians about the District's surveillance system, including the locations where surveillance may occur and that the recordings may be used in disciplinary proceedings and/or referred to local law enforcement, as appropriate.

To the extent that any images from the District's surveillance system create a student or personnel record, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the images are accessed, retained, and disclosed in accordance with law, Board policy, administrative regulation, and any applicable collective bargaining agreements.
