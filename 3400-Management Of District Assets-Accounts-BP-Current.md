## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is optional and should be revised to reflect district practice. Since the management of district assets and accounts is dependent on reliable financial reports, the Governing Board expects that the district's financial reports will adhere to generally accepted financial and accounting standards. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is a nonprofit agency that establishes financial and accounting standards for state and local government agencies, including school districts. By using the California Department of Education's (CDE) standardized account code structure (SACS) software to develop financial reports, the district will be assured of complying with generally accepted accounting principles prescribed by GASB and meeting other state and federal reporting guidelines.
The Governing Board recognizes its fiduciary responsibility to effectively manage and safeguard the district's assets and resources in order to help achieve the district's goals for student learning. The Superintendent or designee shall establish and maintain an accurate, efficient financial management system that enhances the district's ability to meet its fiscal obligations, produces reliable financial reports, and complies with laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's accounting system provides ongoing internal controls and meets generally accepted accounting standards as specified by the California Department of Education and, as appropriate, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). When required by law or as directed by the Board, and in accordance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability, the Superintendent or designee shall submit to the Board reports of the district's financial status.

Capital Assets

CSBA NOTE: Statement #34 from GASB requires that districts determine an appropriate capitalization threshold and identify and valuate capital assets. CDE recommends, for most districts, a capitalization threshold that includes a unit acquisition cost criterion of at least $5,000, although a lower threshold may be necessary for small districts and higher threshold for larger districts. For more information regarding Statement #34, see, "FAQs regarding Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 34," available on CDE's website. The following optional paragraph establishes a $5,000 capitalization threshold consistent with CDE's recommendation. The district should revise the following paragraph if it has established a different threshold.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a system to accurately identify and value district assets in order to help ensure financial accountability and to minimize the risk of loss or misuse. District assets with a useful life of more than one year and an initial acquisition cost of $5,000 or more shall be considered capital assets. The Superintendent or designee shall determine the estimated useful life of each capital asset and shall calculate and report the estimated loss of value or depreciation during each accounting period for all capital assets.

Internal Controls/Fraud Prevention

CSBA NOTE: Internal controls are defined as safeguards that are in place to provide assurance regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Internal controls are checks and balances to help prevent fraud, waste, and abuse.The following section contains recommendations by auditors of internal control policies and procedures and should be modified to reflect district practice.
The Board expects Board members, employees, consultants, vendors, contractors, and other parties maintaining a business relationship with the district to act with integrity and due diligence in dealings involving the district's assets and fiscal resources.

CSBA NOTE: When entering into a contract, a district is required to comply with California's conflict of interest laws, including, but not limited to, Government Code 1090 (financial interest in a contract), Government Code 87100-87500 (Political Reform Act), and Government Code 84308, as amended by SB 1439 (Ch. 848, Statutes of 2022), related to conflict of interest from campaign contributions. Pursuant to Government Code 1090, Board members, district employees, and consultants are prohibited from having a financial interest in any contract made by the Board on behalf of the district. See BP 3312 - Contracts and BB 9270 - Conflicts of Interest.
Board members and district employees involved in the making of contracts on behalf of the district shall comply with the district's conflict of interest policy as specified in Board Bylaw 9270 - Conflict of Interest.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop internal controls which aid in the prevention and detection of fraud, financial impropriety, or irregularity within the district, assist with effective and efficient operation of the district, produce reliable financial information, and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. These internal controls may include, but are not limited to, segregating and monitoring employee duties relating to authorization, custody of assets, and recording or reporting of transactions; providing detailed, written job descriptions explaining the segregation of functions; adopting an integrated financial system; developing timely reconciliations of budgets, ledgers, and accounts; conducting background checks on business office employees; and requiring continuous in-service training for business office staff and board members on the importance of fraud prevention, financial management, budget, and governance.

All employees shall be alert for any indication of fraud, financial impropriety, or irregularity within their area of responsibility. Any employee who suspects fraud, impropriety, or irregularity shall immediately report those suspicions to the employee's immediate supervisor and/or the Superintendent or designee. In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall establish a method for employees and outside persons to anonymously report any suspected instances of fraud, impropriety, or irregularity.

The Superintendent or designee shall have primary responsibility for any necessary investigations of suspected fraud, impropriety, or irregularity, in coordination with legal counsel, the district's auditors, the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT), law enforcement agencies, or other governmental entities, as appropriate.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide regular reports to the Board on the status of the district's internal control procedures and recommend any necessary revisions to related Board policies or administrative regulations.
