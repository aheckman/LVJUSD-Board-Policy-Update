## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44830.1, 44836, 45122.1, and 45123 prohibit the district from hiring or retaining in employment, in a certificated or classified position, a person who has been convicted of or pleads no contest to a violent or serious felony, sex offense, or controlled substance offense, as defined. Exceptions specified in law are reflected in Items #1-5 below.These requirements apply to job applicants, temporary employees, substitute employees, and probationary employees serving before March 15 of their second year. Employees with permanent status may only be suspended or dismissed in accordance with the grounds and procedures specified in BP/AR 4118 - Dismissal/Suspension/Disciplinary Action or BP/AR 4218 - Dismissal/Suspension/Disciplinary Action, as applicable.However, pursuant to Government Code 12954, the district may not discriminate against a person in hiring, termination, or any term or condition of employment based on the person's use of cannabis when off the job or away from the workplace. Additionally, Government Code 12954, as amended by SB 700 (Ch. 408, Statutes of 2023), prohibits the district from requesting information from an applicant related to the applicant's prior use of cannabis, apart from the person's criminal history, unless the district is otherwise legally permitted to consider or inquire about that information. Certain employees may be subject to stricter laws related to drug testing. Districts with questions about drug testing employees should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
The Superintendent or designee shall not hire or retain in employment, in a certificated or classified position, a person who has been convicted of a violent or serious felony as defined in Penal Code 667.5(c) or 1192.7(c), a controlled substance offense as defined in Education Code 44011, or a sex offense as defined in Education Code 44010. However, the Superintendent or designee shall not deny or terminate employment solely on the basis that the person has been:  (Education Code 44830.1, 44836, 45122.1, 45123)

	Convicted of a violent or serious felony, controlled substance offense, or sex offense, and the conviction is reversed and the person is acquitted of the offense in a new trial or the charges against the person are dismissed, unless the sex offense for which the conviction is dismissed pursuant to Penal Code 1203.4 involves a victim who was a minor
	 
	Convicted of a violent or serious felony and has obtained a certificate of rehabilitation or a pardon
	 
	Convicted of a serious felony, that is not also a violent felony, and has proven to the sentencing court that rehabilitation for purposes of school employment has been attained for at least one year
	 
	Convicted of a controlled substance offense and is applying for or is employed in a certificated position and has a credential issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing
	 
	Convicted of a controlled substance offense and is applying for or is employed in a classified position and has been determined by the Governing Board, from the evidence presented, to have been rehabilitated for at least five years

A certificated employee may be hired by the district without obtaining a criminal record summary if that employee is employed as a certificated employee in another California school district and became a permanent employee of another California school district as of October 1, 1997.  (Education Code 44830.1, 44836)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that issue temporary certificates pursuant to Education Code 44332.5 to authorize salary payments while a certificated employee's credential application is being processed. If the issuance of temporary certificates is handled by the county office of education, the following paragraph should be deleted.
The Superintendent or designee shall not issue a temporary certificate of clearance to a person whose application for a credential, certificate, or permit is being processed by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing if that person has been convicted of a violent or serious felony, unless the person is otherwise exempt pursuant to Education Code 44332.6 or 44830.1.  (Education Code 44332.5, 44332.6)

Pre-Employment Record Check

CSBA NOTE: The following section may be revised to reflect district practice. To fulfill the requirement for a criminal record check through the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation, the applicant is required to submit fingerprints using the electronic Live Scan process. Locations offering the Live Scan service are listed on the DOJ's website. The DOJ provides the results to the district via email, or by U.S. mail if no email is available.While the DOJ normally does not provide notice of a conviction for which relief has been granted, pursuant to Penal Code 11105, the Commission on Teacher Credentialing will receive every conviction rendered against an applicant, retroactive to January 1, 2020, regardless of relief granted. However, notwithstanding the above, pursuant to Penal Code 1203.425, information for a conviction for a controlled substance offense listed in Health and Safety Code 11350 or 11377, or former Health and Safety Code 11500 or 11500.5, that is more than five years old, for which relief is granted, is prohibited from being disseminated.
The Superintendent or designee shall require each person to be employed by the district to submit fingerprints electronically through the Live Scan system so that a criminal record check may be conducted by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Superintendent or designee shall provide the applicant with a Live Scan request form and a list of nearby Live Scan locations.

When a person is applying for a classified position, the Superintendent or designee shall request that the DOJ also obtain a criminal record check through the Federal Bureau of Investigation whenever the applicant meets one of the following conditions:  (Education Code 45125)

	The applicant has not resided in California for at least one year immediately preceding the application for employment.
	 
	The applicant has resided in California for more than one year, but less than seven years, and the DOJ has ascertained that the person was convicted of a sex offense where the victim was a minor or a drug offense where an element of the offense is either the distribution to or the use of a controlled substance by a minor.

The Superintendent or designee shall immediately notify the DOJ when an applicant who has submitted fingerprints to the DOJ is not subsequently employed by the district.  (Penal Code 11105.2)

Subsequent Arrest Notification

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44830.1 and 45125, the district is required to sign up for "subsequent arrest notification" from the DOJ in accordance with Penal Code 11105.2. Forms available for this purpose are available on DOJ's website.
The Superintendent or designee shall enter into a contract with the DOJ to receive notification of subsequent arrests resulting in conviction of any person whose fingerprints have been submitted to the DOJ.  (Education Code 44830.1, 45125; Penal Code 11105.2)

Upon telephone or email notification by the DOJ that a current temporary employee, substitute employee, or probationary employee serving before March 15 of the employee's second probationary year has been convicted of a violent or serious felony, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately place that employee on leave without pay.  (Education Code 44830.1, 45122.1)

When the district receives written electronic notification by the DOJ of the fact of conviction, the temporary employee, substitute employee, or probationary employee serving before March 15 of the employee's second probationary year shall be terminated automatically unless the employee challenges the DOJ record and the DOJ withdraws its notification in writing. Upon receipt of the written withdrawal of notification by the DOJ, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately reinstate the employee with full restoration of salary and benefits for the period of time from the suspension without pay to the reinstatement if the employee is still employed by the district.  (Education Code 44830.1, 45122.1)

The Superintendent or designee shall immediately notify the DOJ whenever a person whose fingerprints are maintained by the DOJ is terminated.  (Penal Code 11105.2)

Notification of Applicant/Employee

The Superintendent or designee shall expeditiously furnish a copy of any DOJ notification to the applicant or employee to whom it relates if the information is a basis for an adverse employment decision. The copy shall be delivered in person or to the last contact information provided by the applicant or employee.  (Penal Code 11105, 11105.2)

Maintenance of Records

CSBA NOTE: To be qualified to obtain Criminal Record Offender Information (CORI) for the purpose of employment decisions, the district is required to apply to the DOJ for authorization and is required to designate at least one custodian of records who is responsible for the security, storage, dissemination, and destruction of criminal records furnished to the district.
The Superintendent shall designate at least one custodian of records who shall be responsible for the security, storage, dissemination, and destruction of all Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) furnished to the district and shall serve as the primary contact for the DOJ for any related issues.  (Penal Code 11102.2)

An employee designated as custodian of records shall receive a criminal background check clearance from the DOJ prior to serving in that capacity.  (Penal Code 11102.2)

CSBA NOTE: The DOJ requires every person with access to CORI, including the custodian of records, to complete an Employee Statement Form acknowledging an understanding of the law governing CORI. The custodian of records is required to return such form to the DOJ and to retain any forms completed by other district staff. The Employee Statement Form is reproduced in the accompanying Exhibit.
The custodian of records shall sign and return to the DOJ the Employee Statement Form acknowledging an understanding of the laws prohibiting misuse of CORI. In addition, the custodian of records shall ensure that any individual with access to CORI has on file a signed Employee Statement Form.

To ensure its confidentiality, CORI shall be accessible only to the custodian of records and shall be kept in a locked file separate from other files. CORI shall be used only for the purpose for which it is requested and its contents shall not be disclosed or reproduced.  (Education Code 44830.1, 45125)

Once a hiring determination is made, the applicant's CORI shall be destroyed to the extent that the identity of the individual can no longer be reasonably ascertained.  (Education Code 44830.1, 45125; 11 CCR 708)

The Superintendent or designee shall immediately notify the DOJ whenever a designated custodian of records ceases to serve in that capacity.  (Penal Code 11102.2)

Interagency Agreement

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by any district that has been designated to act on behalf of other school districts within the same county or in contiguous counties to share CORI as authorized by Education Code 44830.2 and 45125.01. Districts that have not entered into an agreement to share such information, or for whom another district or the County Superintendent of Schools has been designated to receive and share the information, should delete this section.Pursuant to Education Code 45125.01, any district that participates in such an interagency agreement may use this arrangement to conduct criminal background checks for a noncertificated candidate for a paid or volunteer position in a student activity program pursuant to Education Code 49024; see BP/AR 1240 - Volunteer Assistance and BP/AR 4127/4227/4327 - Temporary Athletic Team Coaches.
Subject to an interagency agreement with other school districts, the district shall submit and receive CORI on behalf of all participating districts.  (Education Code 44830.2, 45125.01)

Upon receipt from the DOJ of a report of conviction of a serious or violent felony, the district shall communicate that fact to participating districts and shall remove the affected employee from the common list of persons eligible for employment. (Education Code 44830.2, 45125.01)

In addition, upon receipt from the DOJ of a criminal history record or report of subsequent arrest for any person on a common list of persons eligible for employment, the district shall give notice to the superintendent of any participating district, or the person designated in writing by that superintendent, that the report is available for inspection on a confidential basis by the superintendent or the authorized designee. The report shall be made available at the district office for 30 days following the receipt of the notice.  (Education Code 44830.2, 45125.01)

The district shall not release a copy of that information to any participating district or any other person. In addition, the district shall retain or dispose of the information in the manner specified in law and in this administrative regulation after all participating districts have had an opportunity to inspect it in accordance with law.  (Education Code 44830.2, 45125.01)

The district shall maintain a record of all persons to whom the information has been shown and shall make this record available to the DOJ.  (Education Code 44830.2, 45125.01)
