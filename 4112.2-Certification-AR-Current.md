## Policy Content

Verification of Credentials

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 44330, 44332.5, and 44857, each person employed in a position requiring certification qualifications must register a valid credential not later than 60 days after beginning employment in the district or not later than 60 days after renewing a credential. Pursuant to Education Code 44332.5, a district with over 10,000 average daily attendance (ADA) may provide for the registration of its own certificated employees' credentials. If it does not do so, or if the district has 10,000 ADA or less, certificated employees' credentials must be registered with the county office of education (COE).Pursuant to 5 CCR 80001, the official record of a credential includes any credential in a paper or electronic format, including, but not limited to, information obtained from CTC's web site. Since CTC does not provide credentials in a paper format, the district must obtain verification of its employees' certification through CTC's online service and may print the displayed information.
The Superintendent or designee shall verify that each employee in a position requiring certification qualifications possesses a valid certification document issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). Such verification shall occur not later than 60 days after the commencement of employment or the renewal of a credential.  (Education Code 44857)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44332, 44332.5, and 44332.6, an individual may be employed while CTC is processing the application if the individual holds a temporary certificate issued by a district with over 10,000 ADA or the COE, indicating that the individual has passed the state assessment of teachers' basic skills and completed a criminal record check. Education Code 44332, 44332.5, and 44332.6 require the district or COE, prior to issuing a temporary certificate, to obtain a certificate of clearance (fingerprint clearance) from CTC to satisfy the criminal record check requirement.
The Superintendent or designee shall verify that any person who is employed by the district while CTC is processing the application for certification possesses a temporary certificate based on a demonstration of basic skills and completion of a criminal background check.  (Education Code 44332, 44332.5, 44332.6)

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records of the appropriate certification of all employees serving in certificated positions.

Basic Skills Proficiency

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44830 provides that a district cannot employ an individual in a position requiring certification unless that person has met the basic skills proficiency requirement or is exempted from the requirement by law. Such exemptions are specified in Education Code 44252 and 44830. Unless exempted, persons who have been granted a credential by CTC have met the basic skills proficiency requirement as a condition of obtaining the credential.
The district shall not initially hire a person in a position requiring certification, on a permanent, temporary, or substitute basis, unless that person has demonstrated basic skills proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics or is specifically exempted from the requirement by law.  (Education Code 44252, 44252.6, 44830)

CSBA NOTE: According to CTC leaflet CL-667, "Basic Skills Requirement," the basic skills proficiency requirement may be met as reflected in Items #1-8, below.
A person may demonstrate basic skills proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics by:

	Passage of the California Subject Examinations for Teachers: Multiple Subjects plus Writing Skills Examination
	 
	Passage of the California State University (CSU) Early Assessment Program or the CSU Placement Examinations  (Education Code 44252)
	 
	Achieving a qualifying score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or the American College Test (Education Code 44252)
	 
	Achieving a qualifying score on College Board Advanced Placement Examinations

	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44252, a person is exempt from the basic skills proficiency test requirement by earning at least a letter grade of B in qualifying coursework determined by a credential preparation program, or determined by CTC for an applicant not enrolled in a California credential preparation program. "Qualifying coursework" means a course or courses taken at a regionally accredited institution of higher education for academic credit that applies toward the requirements for an associate's degree, baccalaureate degree, or higher degree. Qualifying coursework does not include professional development or continuing education units, inservice training or workshops, or courses where credits do not apply toward the requirements for an associate's degree, baccalaureate degree, or higher degree. Pursuant to Education Code 44203, the definition of a "regionally accredited institution" includes an institution of higher education that held preaccreditation status at the time the degree of an applicant for a credential was conferred if the institution achieved full accreditation status within five years of earning preaccreditation status in addition to an institution of higher education that has already been designated as regionally accredited.
	Qualifying coursework  (Education Code 44252)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44252, a person is exempt from the basic skills proficiency test requirement if a credential preparation program or CTC determines that an applicant has demonstrated proficiency through a combination of coursework, as described in Item #7, above, passage of a component or components of the basic skills proficiency test, and scores described in Items #3 and 4, above.
	Qualifying coursework and exams  (Education Code 44252)

The district may hire a certificated employee who has not taken a test of basic skills proficiency if the employee has not yet been afforded the opportunity to take the test, provided that the employee takes the test at the earliest opportunity. The employee may remain employed by the district pending the receipt of the test results.  (Education Code 44830)

An out-of-state prepared teacher shall meet the basic skills requirement within one year of being issued a California preliminary credential by CTC unless the teacher has completed a basic skills proficiency test in another state, passed a basic skills proficiency test developed and administered by the district, by cooperating districts or by the county office of education (COE), or is otherwise exempted by law. The district shall develop a basic skills proficiency test, which shall be at least equivalent to the district test required for high school graduation, for purposes of assessing out-of-state prepared teachers pending completion of the basic skills requirement.  (Education Code 44252, 44274.2; 5 CCR 80071.4, 80413.3)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44252 and 44830, persons holding or applying for a "designated subjects special subjects" credential must be assessed with a district basic skills proficiency test, unless their credential requires possession of a bachelor's degree in which case they are required to meet the state basic skills proficiency requirement. When such persons are employed by a consortium of districts or a joint powers agreement, the test may instead be established by the boards of those entities.
Any person holding or applying for a "designated subjects special subjects" credential which does not require possession of a bachelor's degree shall pass a district proficiency test in lieu of meeting the state basic skills proficiency requirement.  (Education Code 44252, 44830)

The district may charge a fee to persons being tested to cover the costs of developing, administering, and grading the district proficiency test.  (Education Code 44252, 44830)

The district also shall submit a signed statement from the Superintendent or designee that the agenda item was acted upon favorably.
	 
	The candidate has been apprised of steps to earn a credential and enroll in an internship program.

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 80021.1 provides that a holder of the PIP is authorized to provide the same service as a holder of the preliminary or clear credential of the same type (i.e., multiple subject, single subject, education specialist). In addition, 5 CCR 80021.1 provides that all PIPs will include an English learner authorization allowing the holder to provide services in ELD and SDAIE; see AR 4112.22 - Staff Teaching English Learners. Upon request by the district and verification of the applicant's target-language proficiency, the PIP may instead include a bilingual authorization allowing the holder to provide instruction for primary language development or content instruction delivered in the primary language, in addition to ELD and SDAIE.
The holder of a PIP may be assigned to provide the same service as a holder of a multiple subject, single subject, or education specialist credential in accordance with the authorizations specified on the permit.  (5 CCR 80021.1)
