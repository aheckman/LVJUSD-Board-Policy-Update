## Policy Content

The Superintendent or designee shall develop a campus security plan which contributes to a positive school climate, fosters social and emotional learning and student well-being, and includes strategies to:

	Secure the campus perimeter and school facilities in order to prevent criminal activity
	
	These strategies include a risk management analysis of each campus' security system, lighting system, and fencing.  Procedures to ensure unobstructed views and eliminate blind spots caused by doorways and landscaping shall also be considered.  In addition, parking lot design may be studied, including methods to discourage through traffic.
	 
	Secure buildings and interior spaces from outsiders and discourage trespassing
	
	These strategies may include installing locks, requiring visitor registration, providing staff and student identification tags, and patrolling places used for congregating and loitering.
	 
	Secure the District's network infrastructure and web applications from cyberattacks
	
	These strategies may include performing an independent security assessment of the District's network infrastructure and selected web applications.
	 
	Discourage vandalism and graffiti
	
	These strategies may include plans to immediately cover graffiti and implement campus beautification.
	 
	Control access to keys and other school inventory
	 
	Detect and intervene with school crime
	
	These strategies may include creating a school watch program, increasing adult presence and supervision, establishing an anonymous crime reporting system, monitoring suspicious and/or threatening digital media content, analyzing school crime incidents, and collaborating with local law enforcement agencies, including providing for law enforcement presence.
	
	Additionally, all staff shall be made aware of their responsibilities regarding the immediate reporting of potential homicidal acts to law enforcement, and receive training in the assessment and reporting of such threats.

All staff shall receive training in building and grounds security procedures and emergency response.

Locks

All state-funded new construction and modernization projects shall include locks that allow doors to classrooms and any room with an occupancy of five or more persons to be locked from the inside.  Student restrooms and doors that lock from the outside at all times are not required to have locks that can be locked from the inside.  (Education Code 17075.50, 17583; 24 CCR 1010.2, 1010.2.8.2)

Keys

The principal or designee shall be responsible for all keys used in a school. Keys shall be issued only to authorized employees who regularly need a key in order to carry out job responsibilities.

The principal or designee shall create a key control system with a record of each key assigned and room(s) or building(s) which the key opens.

Keys shall never be loaned to students, parents/guardians, or volunteers, nor shall the master key ever be loaned.

Any person issued a key shall be responsible for its safekeeping.  The duplication of school keys is prohibited.  If a key is lost, the person responsible shall immediately report the loss to the principal or designee and shall pay for a replacement key.

Employee Identification/Access Badges

Employee Identification/Access badges used in a school or District facility shall be the responsibility of the administrator or designee.

Badges shall be issued to all employees. Badges are to be worn such as they are visible while on campus or on District property.

The District designee shall create a badge and access control system with a record of each badge assigned to employees.

Badges shall be used by authorized employees and shall never be loaned to other staff, students, or community.

The person issued a badge shall be responsible for its safekeeping. If a badge is lost, the person responsible shall immediately report the loss to the administrator or designee.
