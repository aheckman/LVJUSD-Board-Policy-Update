## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the District's responsibility to comply with state and federal nondiscrimination laws as they apply to the District's nutrition programs. The District shall not deny any individual the benefits or service of any nutrition program or discriminate on any basis prohibited by law.

Compliance Coordinator

The Board shall designate a compliance coordinator for nutrition programs, who may also be the compliance officer(s) specified in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, to ensure compliance with the laws governing the District's nutrition programs.

The responsibilities of the compliance coordinator include, but are not limited to:

	Providing the name of the compliance coordinator, the Section 504 coordinator, and Title IX coordinator, if different from the compliance coordinator, to the California Department of Education (CDE) and other interested parties
	 
	Annually providing mandatory civil rights training to all frontline staff who interact with program applicants or participants and to those who supervise frontline staff
	
	The subject matter of such training shall include, but not be limited to, collection and use of data, effective public notification systems, complaint procedures, compliance review techniques, resolution of noncompliance, requirements for reasonable accommodation of persons with disabilities, requirements for language assistance, conflict resolution, and customer service.
	 
	Establishing admission and enrollment procedures that do not restrict enrollment of students on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or disability, including preventing staff from incorrectly denying applications and ensuring that such persons have equal access to all programs
	 
	Sending a public release announcing the availability of the child nutrition programs and/or changes in the programs to public media and to community and grassroots organizations that interact directly with eligible or potentially eligible participants
	 
	Communicating the program's nondiscrimination policy and applicable complaint procedures, as provided in the section "Notifications" below
	 
	Providing appropriate translation services when a significant number of persons in the surrounding population have limited English proficiency
	 
	Ensuring that every part of a facility is accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities and that participants with disabilities are not excluded from the benefits or services due to inaccessibility of facilities
	 
	Ensuring that special meals are made available to participants with disabilities who have a medical statement on file documenting that their disability restricts their diet
	 
	Implementing procedures to process and resolve civil rights complaints, including alleged discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and program-related complaints, including maintaining a complaint log, working with the appropriate person to resolve any complaint, and referring the complainant to the appropriate state or federal agency when necessary
	 
	Developing a method, which preferably uses self-identification or self-reporting, to collect racial and ethnic data for potentially eligible populations, applicants, and participants

Notifications

The compliance coordinator shall ensure that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) "And Justice for All" civil rights poster, or a substitute poster approved by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, is displayed in areas visible to the District's nutrition program participants, such as food service areas and school offices.

The compliance coordinator shall notify the public, all program applicants, participants, and potentially eligible persons of their rights and responsibilities and steps necessary to participate in the nutrition programs, including program requirements and program availability. Applicants, participants, and the public also shall be advised of their right to file a complaint, how to file a complaint, the complaint procedures, and that a complaint may be filed anonymously or by a third party.

In addition, the compliance coordinator shall ensure that all forms of communication available to the public regarding program availability shall contain, in a prominent location, the most current version of the nondiscrimination statement provided by USDA about the District's status as an equal opportunity provider and the address of the agency with responsibility to handle complaints made against the District.

Forms of communication requiring this nondiscrimination statement include, but are not limited to, web sites, public information releases, publications, and posters, but exclude items such as cups, buttons, magnets, menus, and pens that identify the program when the size or configuration makes it impractical. The nondiscrimination statement need not be included on every page of program information on the District's or school's web site, but the statement or a link to the statement shall be included on the home page of the program information.

A short version of the nondiscrimination statement, as provided by USDA, may be used on pamphlets, brochures, and flyers in the same print size as the rest of the text.
