## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that offer classified employees a leave of absence for purposes of study or retraining, as authorized by Education Code 45380-45387. The policy may be subject to collective bargaining agreements and, in merit system districts, to personnel commission rules.
The Governing Board recognizes that a broad range of experiences can strengthen an employee's ability to meet the district's needs.

The Board may grant a professional leave of absence for up to one year to classified employees for the purpose of permitting study or retraining the employee to meet changing conditions within the district.  No more than one such leave of absence may be granted to an employee in a seven-year period for purposes of study or three-year period for purposes of retraining.  (Education Code 45381, 45382)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 45382 requires that an employee serve in the district a specified period of time to be eligible for professional leave. Education Code 45382 authorizes the Governing Board and/or the personnel commission in merit system districts to prescribe additional standards of service which shall entitle the employee to the leave of absence.  The following paragraph may be modified to reflect district practice.
To be eligible for a leave for study purposes, the employee must have served in the district for at least seven consecutive years preceding the granting of the leave. If the leave is for purposes of retraining, the employee must have served in the district for at least three consecutive years preceding the granting of the leave. Any professional leave of absence granted by the Board shall not be deemed a break in service. However, it will not be included as service in computing service for the granting of any subsequent professional leave.  (Education Code 45382)

Rather than granting a professional leave for a continuous one-year period, the Board may require that the leave be taken in separate six-month periods or in any other appropriate periods, provided that the total leave is completed within three years. Any period of service by the employee between the separate periods of leave shall comprise a part of the service required for qualifying for a subsequent leave of absence.  (Education Code 45381)

The Board and employee may agree in writing to have the employee perform services for the district during the professional leave.  (Education Code 45383)

The employee shall receive such compensation during the leave as the Board and employee agree upon in writing, which shall not be less than the difference between the employee's salary and the salary of a substitute employee in the position which the employee held prior to the granting of the leave. In lieu of such a difference, the Board may pay one-half of the salary of the employee or any additional amount up to and including the full salary of the employee.  (Education Code 45383)

Compensation during the leave shall be paid in the manner authorized by Education Code 45384.

The Board may grant reimbursement of the costs, including tuition fees, to any classified employee who satisfactorily completes approved training to improve his/her job knowledge, ability, or skill, as long as the employee is not eligible for reimbursement by another governmental agency, organization, or association. Programs eligible for reimbursement include, but are not limited to, courses of study at approved academic institutions, seminars and training institutes conducted by recognized professional associations, conferences, meetings, and other training programs that are designed to upgrade the classified service and encourage the retraining of employees who may otherwise be subject to layoff as the result of technological changes.  (Education Code 45387)
