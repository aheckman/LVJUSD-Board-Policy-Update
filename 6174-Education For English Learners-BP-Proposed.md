## Policy Content

The Board of Education intends to provide English learners with challenging curriculum and instruction that maximize the attainment of high levels of proficiency in English, advance multilingual capabilities, and facilitate student achievement in the District's regular course of study.

English learners shall be provided differentiated English language development instruction which is targeted to their English proficiency level. Such instruction shall be based on sound instructional theory, be aligned with state content standards, emphasize inquiry-based learning and critical thinking skills, and be integrated across all subject areas.

No middle or high school student who is an English learner shall be denied enrollment in any of the following:  (Education Code 60811.8)


	Courses in the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science, and history/social science, courses required to meet state and local high school graduation requirements, or courses required for middle school grade promotion
	
	However, a middle or high school student who is a newcomer student or an immigrant child or youth, as defined in 20 USC 7011, or is a student participating in a program designed to meet the academic and transitional needs of newcomer students and that has as its primary objective the development of English language proficiency, may be denied enrollment in any of the courses stated above if the course of study provided to the student is designed to remedy academic deficits incurred during participation and is reasonably calculated to enable the student to attain parity of participation in the standard instructional program within a reasonable length of time after the student enters the school system.
	 
	A full course load of courses specified in Item #1 above
	 
	Other courses that meet the "A-G" course requirements for college admission or are advanced courses such as honors or Advanced Placement courses, on the sole basis of the student's classification as an English learner

The District shall identify in its local control and accountability plan (LCAP) goals and specific actions and services to enhance student engagement, academic achievement, and other outcomes for English learners and long-term English learners, in accordance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.

The Superintendent or designee shall encourage parent/guardian and community involvement in the development and evaluation of programs for English learners. The Superintendent or designee may also provide an English development literacy training program for parents/guardians and community members so that they may better support students' English language development.

Staff Qualifications and Training

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all staff employed to teach English learners possess the appropriate authorization from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.

The District shall provide effective professional development to teachers (including teachers in classroom settings that are not the settings of language instruction educational programs), administrators, and other school or community-based organization personnel to improve the instruction and assessment of English learners and enhance staff's ability to understand and use curricula, assessment, and instructional strategies for English learners. Such professional development shall be of sufficient intensity and duration to produce a positive and lasting impact on teachers' performance in the classroom.  (20 USC 6825)

Staff development shall also address the sociocultural needs of English learners and provide opportunities for teachers to engage in supportive, collaborative learning communities.

Identification and Assessment

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain procedures for the early identification and assessment of the proficiency of English learners at all grade levels, except transitional kindergarten, using the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC). To oversee test administration, the Superintendent or designee shall annually designate a District ELPAC coordinator and a site coordinator for each test site in accordance with 5 CCR 11518.40-11518.45.

Once identified as an English learner, a student shall be annually assessed for language proficiency until the student is reclassified based on criteria specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.

In addition, English learners' academic achievement in English language arts, mathematics, science, and any additional subject required by law shall be assessed using the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress. As necessary, the test shall be administered with testing variations in accordance with 5 CCR 853. English learners who are in their first 12 months of attending a school in the United States shall be exempted from taking the English language arts assessment to the extent allowed by federal law.  (Education Code 60603, 60640; 5 CCR 853)

Formative assessments may be utilized to analyze student performance and appropriately adapt teaching methodologies and instructions.

Language Acquisition Programs

The District shall offer research-based language acquisition programs that are designed to ensure English acquisition as rapidly and as effectively as possible and that provide instruction to students on the state-adopted academic content standards, including the English language development standards.  (Education Code 306; 5 CCR 11300)

At a minimum, the District shall offer a structured English immersion program which includes designated and integrated English language development. In the structured English immersion program, nearly all of the classroom instruction shall be provided in English, but with the curriculum and presentation designed for students who are learning English.  (Education Code 305-306; 5 CCR 11309)

For the purpose of determining the amount of instruction to be conducted in English in the structured English immersion program, "nearly all" means that all classroom instruction shall be conducted in English except for clarification, explanation, and support as needed.

In addition, language acquisition programs offered by the District may include, but are not limited to, the following:  (Education Code 305-306)

	A dual-language immersion program that provides integrated language learning and academic instruction for native speakers of English and native speakers of another language, with the goals of high academic achievement, first and second language proficiency, and cross-cultural understanding
	 
	A transitional or developmental program for English learners that provides literacy and academic instruction in English and a student's native language and that enables an English learner to achieve English proficiency and academic mastery of subject matter content and higher order thinking skills, including critical thinking, in order to meet state academic content standards

The District's language acquisition programs for grades K-3 shall comply with class size requirements specified in Education Code 42238.02.  (Education Code 310)

In establishing the District's language acquisition programs, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with parents/guardians and the community during the LCAP development process. The Superintendent or designee shall also consult with administrators, teachers, and other personnel with appropriate authorizations and experience in establishing a language acquisition program. (Education Code 305)

At the beginning of each school year or upon a student's enrollment, parents/guardians shall be provided information on the types of language acquisition programs available to students enrolled in the District, including, but not limited to, a description of each program, the process to be followed in making a program selection, identification of any language to be taught in addition to English when the program includes instruction in another language, and the process to request establishment of a language acquisition program.  (Education Code 310; 5 CCR 11310)

Whenever a student is identified as an English learner based on the results of the ELPAC, the student's parents/guardians may choose a language acquisition program that best suits their child. To the extent possible, any language acquisition program requested by the parents/guardians of 30 or more students at the school or by the parents/guardians of 20 or more students at any grade level shall be offered by the school.  (Education Code 310; 5 CCR 11311)

Reclassification/Redesignation

When an English learner has acquired a reasonable level of English proficiency, as determined based on state and District reclassification criteria pursuant to Education Code 52164.6, or upon the request of the parent/guardian of an English learner, the student shall be transferred from a language acquisition program into an English language mainstream classroom.

English learners shall be reclassified as fluent English proficient when they are able to comprehend, speak, read, and write English well enough to receive instruction in an English language mainstream classroom and make academic progress at a level substantially equivalent to that of students of the same age or grade whose primary language is English and who are in the regular course of study.  (Education Code 52164.6)

The criteria for determining whether an English learner shall be reclassified as fluent English proficient shall include, but not be limited to:  (Education Code 313, 52164.6; 5 CCR 11303)

	Assessment of English language proficiency using an objective assessment instrument, including, but not limited to, the ELPAC
	 
	Evaluation by the student's classroom teacher and any other certificated staff with direct responsibility for teaching or placement decisions related to the student, including, but not limited to, a review of the student's curriculum mastery and academic performance
	 
	Parent/guardian involvement, including:
	 
	
		Notice to parents/guardians of language reclassification and placement, including a description of the reclassification process and the parent/guardian's opportunity to participate
		 
		Encouragement of parent/guardian participation in the District's reclassification procedure, including seeking parent/guardian opinion and consultation during the reclassification process
		 
		Provision of an interpreter for the parent/guardian, when necessary
		 
	
	
	Comparison of student performance on an objective assessment of basic skills in English against an empirically established range of performance in basic skills, based on the performance of English proficient students of the same age, which demonstrates whether the student is sufficiently proficient in English to participate effectively in a curriculum designed for students of the same age whose native language is English

The student's language proficiency assessments, the participants in the reclassification process, and any decisions regarding reclassification shall be retained in the student's permanent record.  (5 CCR 11305)

The Superintendent or designee shall monitor the progress of reclassified students to ensure their correct classification and placement.  (5 CCR 11304)

The Superintendent or designee shall monitor students for at least four years following their reclassification to ensure the students have not prematurely exited, any academic deficit incurred through participation in the English learner program has been remedied, and the students are meaningfully participating in the standard instructional program compared to students who had never participated in an English learner program.  (5 CCR 11304; 20 USC 6841)

Program Evaluation

To evaluate the effectiveness of the District's educational program for English learners, the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board, at least annually, regarding:

	Progress of English learners towards proficiency in English
	 
	The number and percentage of English learners reclassified as fluent English proficient
	 
	The number and percentage of English learners who are or are at risk of being classified as long-term English learners as defined in Education Code 313.1
	 
	The achievement of English learners on standards-based tests in core curricular areas
	 
	For any language acquisition program that includes instruction in a language other than English, student achievement in the non-English language in accordance with 5 CCR 11309
	 
	Progress toward any other goals identified in the District's LCAP for English learners and long-term English learners as defined in Education Code 52052
	 
	A comparison of current data with data from at least the previous year in regard to Items #1-6 above
	 
	A comparison of data between the different language acquisition programs offered by the District


The Superintendent or designee shall also provide the Board with regular reports from any District or schoolwide English learner advisory committees.
