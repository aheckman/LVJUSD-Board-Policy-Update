## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy, accompanying administrative regulation, and exhibit are for complaints concerning the content or use of any existing textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library, and should be revised to reflect district practice.The California Department of Education's (CDE), "Guidance for Local Instructional Materials Adoptions," provides guidance for districts when identifying, reviewing, piloting, and adopting instructional materials in all content areas, including links to current legislation, sample timelines, support for student groups, and implementation considerations.For complaints regarding the sufficiency of instructional materials or textbooks pursuant to Education Code 35186, see AR/E(1)/E(2) 1312.4 - Williams Uniform Complaint Procedures.For policy related to the selection, evaluation, and prohibited use of individual instructional materials, see BP/AR 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials, BP 6161.11 - Supplementary Instructional Materials, and BP 6163.1 - Library Media Centers. For more information regarding the adoption of instructional materials, see CSBA's, "Instructional Materials Adoptions: State and local governing board processes, roles, and responsibilities," "Instructional Materials Adoption: Local governing board responsibilities," and "State Roles, Responsibilities, and Process for Instructional Materials Adoption," and the California Attorney General's, "Guidance to School Officials re: Legal Requirements for Providing Inclusive Curricula and Books." 
The Governing Board uses a comprehensive process to adopt district instructional materials that is based on selection criteria established by law and Board policy and includes opportunities for the involvement of district staff, parents/guardians, and community members, and, as appropriate, students. Complaints concerning the content or use of instructional materials, including textbooks, supplementary instructional materials, library materials, or other instructional materials and equipment, shall be properly and fairly considered using established complaint procedures.

Parents/guardians are encouraged to discuss any concerns regarding instructional materials with their student’s teacher and/or the school principal. If the situation remains unresolved, a complaint may be filed using the process specified in the accompanying administrative regulation and exhibit.

The district shall accept complaints concerning instructional materials only from staff, district residents, or the parents/guardians of students enrolled in a district school.  (Education Code 35160)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 243 clarifies when it is unlawful discrimination for the Governing Board to (1) refuse to approve the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library, or (2) prohibit the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library. The Board may not refuse to approve such use on the basis that the material includes a study of the role and contributions of specified individuals or groups, unless the study of the role and contributions reflects adversely upon legally protected groups. Additionally, the Board may not prohibit such use on the basis that the study of the role and contributions contain inclusive or diverse perspectives. In addition, pursuant to Education Code 244, as added by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), the Board is prohibited from adopting or approving the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or curriculum for classroom instruction if the use of the textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or curriculum would subject a student to unlawful discrimination pursuant to Education Code 220.Complaints alleging discrimination based on a violation of Education Code 243 or 244, as added by SB 153, may be brought under the district's uniform complaint procedures or may be filed directly with the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI). Complaints that are filed directly with the SPI are required to identify the basis for doing so, and present evidence that supports the basis for the direct filing. In such cases, the SPI may directly intervene without waiting for an investigation by the district. See BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.
However, a complaint related to the use or prohibited use of any existing textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library that alleges unlawful discrimination based on a violation of Education Code 243 or 244 shall be filed, investigated, and resolved in accordance with Board Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

CSBA NOTE: CDE's, "Guidance for Local Instructional Materials Adoptions," provides guidance regarding how to review instructional materials to ensure that they represent diverse perspectives and are culturally relevant.  Additionally, the Attorney General's, "Guidance to School Officials re: Legal Requirements for Providing Inclusive Curricula and Books," provides guidance to districts regarding the obligation to provide curricula, instructional materials, and books that are inclusive and reflect the roles and contributions of our diverse population.
When deliberating upon challenged materials, the Superintendent, or any designee or committee established by the Superintendent to review the materials, shall consider the degree to which the materials align with the criteria for instructional materials as specified in law, Board policy, and administrative regulation. In addition, such deliberations may consider the educational philosophy and vision of the district; the educational suitability of the materials including the manner in which the materials support the curriculum and appropriateness for the student's age; the professional opinions of teachers of the subject and of other competent authorities and/or experts; reviews of the materials by reputable bodies; the stated objectives in using the materials; community standards; the allegations in the complaint, including the extent to which the objections are based on the dislike of ideas contained in the materials; and the impact that keeping or removing the materials would have on student well-being.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 243 clarifies that it is unlawful discrimination for the Board to prohibit the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library on the basis that it contains inclusive or diverse perspectives. Additionally, Education Code 244, as added by SB 153, prohibits the Board from adopting or approving the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or curriculum for classroom instruction if the use would subject a student to unlawful discrimination pursuant to Education Code 220.While Education Code 243 and 244 are specifically applicable to boards, districts should assume that any similar decision by the Superintendent, designee, or any committee established by the Superintendent would likely constitute unlawful discrimination as well; see BP 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials.
The Superintendent, or any designee or committee established by the Superintendent to review the materials, shall not prohibit the continued use of an appropriately adopted textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library on the basis that it contains inclusive and/or diverse perspectives, as specified in Education Code 243.  

Additionally, the Superintendent, or any designee or committee established by the Superintendent to the review materials, shall not authorize the continued use of an adopted textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or curriculum for classroom instruction if the use would subject a student to unlawful discrimination pursuant to Education Code 220.  

If the complainant finds the Superintendent's or review committee's decision unsatisfactory, the complainant may appeal the decision to the Board.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph limits reconsideration within a specified time period and should be modified to reflect district practice.
Any challenged instructional material that is reviewed by the district shall not be subject to further reconsideration for 12 months, unless required by law.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35186 details a specific process that districts must use to resolve complaints regarding sufficiency/availability of instructional materials or textbooks. See AR/E(1)/E(2) 1312.4 - Williams Uniform Complaint Procedures.Pursuant to Education Code 60119, boards are required to hold a public hearing annually regarding the sufficiency of instructional materials. If, at the public hearing, the Board makes a determination of "insufficient materials," Education Code 1240 requires the Board to take certain actions and specifies potential consequences for not remedying the deficiency as required by law; see BP 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials.
Complaints related to the sufficiency of textbooks or instructional materials shall be resolved as specified in Administrative Regulation 1312.4 - Williams Uniform Complaint Procedures.
