## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6311, the California Department of Education (CDE) has established a system of school support and improvement to assist low-performing schools. Based on data in the California School Dashboard (or other performance data if a school is too small to receive a color-coded performance level on the Dashboard), every three years CDE identifies schools that need comprehensive support and improvement (CSI), including (1) schools in the lowest performing five percent of Title I schools and (2) all high schools (including Title I, non-Title I, traditional, and alternative schools) with a graduation rate lower than 67 percent averaged over two years. A district with school(s) that meet the criteria for CSI is eligible to apply to CDE for Title I, Part A funding to assist with the development and implementation of a plan to improve student outcomes. Such a district may also choose to provide all students in a CSI school the option to transfer to another district school, provided that priority is given to the lowest achieving students from low-income families, and may use up to five percent of its Title I allocation to pay for transportation for this purpose.Schools will be annually identified for targeted support and improvement (TSI) if one or more student subgroups, for two consecutive years, meet the criteria for the lowest performing five percent of Title I schools. Every three years, TSI schools that have not improved will be identified for additional targeted support and improvement (ATSI). Identification of schools for CSI and ATSI began in the 2018-19 school year. Schools will be identified for TSI for the first time beginning in 2020-21.
The Governing Board is committed to enabling all district students to meet state academic achievement standards. The district shall provide support and assistance to increase student achievement in all district schools, especially any school that has been identified by the California Department of Education (CDE) as in need of comprehensive support and improvement (CSI), targeted support and improvement (TSI), or additional targeted support and improvement (ATSI).

When any school is identified for CSI, TSI, or ATSI, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the school community, including the principal, teachers, and parent/guardians of students of the school, of the identification and, if applicable, shall inform the school of the student subgroup(s) which are consistently underperforming at the school.

School Plan

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6311, the district is required to develop a school improvement plan for each school identified for CSI, TSI, or ATSI, which must be based on all state indicators in the California School Dashboard. In accordance with the discretion granted to state agencies under 20 USC 6311, CDE has determined that schools eligible for Dashboard Alternative School Status pursuant to Education Code 52052 that have fewer than 100 students are not exempted from this requirement, but they do have flexibility within the school planning process to focus on the Dashboard state indicators that are more applicable to the nature of their program. See the Frequently Asked Questions on CDE's web site.20 USC 6311 also requires that the plan include evidence-based interventions. Such interventions are described in the U.S. Department of Education's Non-Regulatory Guidance: Using Evidence to Strengthen Education Investments.
Upon receiving notification from CDE that a district school has been identified as eligible for CSI, TSI, or ATSI, the district shall, in partnership with principals, other school leaders, teachers, and parents/guardians, develop and implement a plan to improve student outcomes at the school.  The plan shall:  (20 USC 6311)

	Be based on all state indicators in the California School Dashboard, including student performance against state-determined long-term goals, except that any school subject to the state's Dashboard Alternative School Status that has fewer than 100 students may focus on the state indicators that are more applicable to the nature of its program
	 
	Be based on a school-level needs assessment
	 
	Include evidence-based interventions
	 
	If the school is identified for CSI or ATSI, identify resource inequities, which may include a review of district and school-level budgets, to be addressed through implementation of the plan  

The school plan for student achievement developed pursuant to Education Code 64001 may serve as the school improvement plan required for CSI, TSI, or ATSI, provided that the plan meets the requirements of 20 USC 6311.  (Education Code 64001)

The school improvement plan shall be submitted to the Board for approval.  (20 USC 6311)

CSBA NOTE: In addition to requiring district approval of school plans, 20 USC 6311 requires that CSI plans be approved by the state educational agency. However, CDE does not directly review and approve school-level plans. Instead, the template adopted by the State Board of Education for the local control and accountability plan requires a district with school(s) identified for CSI to provide the following information within the plan summary.
If any district school is identified for CSI, the district's local control and accountability plan shall include descriptions of how the district provides support to CSI school(s) in developing the CSI plan and how the district will monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the CSI plan to support student and school improvement.

Monitoring and Intervention

The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall regularly review the performance of each school identified for CSI, TSI, or ATSI. 

CSBA NOTE: For schools identified for TSI, 20 USC 6311 requires the district to monitor the school's implementation of its plan and take action if implementation of the plan is unsuccessful after a period of years established by the district. The following paragraph extends this requirement to CSI and ATSI schools and may be modified to reflect district practice, including the number of years for determining if the plan has been successful.
After two years of implementing the school plan, if any such school has been unsuccessful in improving student outcomes to a level that exceeds initial eligibility criteria, the district shall identify the problem and take additional action as necessary.

CSBA NOTE: In accordance with 20 USC 6311 and CDE's California ESSA Consolidated State Plan, schools identified for ATSI and CSI are expected to meet exit criteria after four years. A school is considered to have met exit criteria if it no longer has any combination of performance levels on state indicators that meet the criteria used for identification at the time the school was identified.For schools identified for CSI, CDE must monitor and periodically review the implementation of the school's plan. The following paragraph reflects interventions established by CDE that may be imposed if a school fails to satisfy the exit criteria for CSI within four years of the initial identification. For further information, see CDE's California ESSA Consolidated State Plan.
If a school identified for CSI fails to improve student outcomes within four years to a level that exceeds the CSI eligibility criteria, it shall be subject to more rigorous interventions that include, but are not limited to, partnering with an external entity, agency, or individual with demonstrated expertise and capacity to:

	Conduct a new needs assessment that focuses on systemic factors and conduct a root cause analysis that identifies gaps between current conditions and desired conditions in student performance and progress
	 
	Use the results of the analysis along with stakeholder feedback to develop a new improvement plan that includes:
	 
	
		A prioritized set of evidence-based interventions and strategies 
		 
		A program evaluation component with support to conduct ongoing performance and progress monitoring
