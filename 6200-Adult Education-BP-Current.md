The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board on the effectiveness of the district's adult education program. This report shall include, but not be limited to, the number of adults and high school students participating in the program, student participation in each type of adult education course or class, and the extent to which students successfully completed these programs, including, as applicable, the completion of requirements for the high school diploma or certificate of equivalency.
