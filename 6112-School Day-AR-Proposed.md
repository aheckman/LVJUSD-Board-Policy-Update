	At least 240 minutes for students in grades 4-8  (Education Code 46113, 46142)

Students in grade 12 shall be enrolled in at least five courses each semester or the equivalent number of courses each quarter. This requirement shall not apply to students enrolled in regional occupational centers or programs, courses at accredited postsecondary institutions, independent study, special education programs in which the student's individualized education program establishes a different number of courses, continuation education classes, work experience education programs, or any other course of study authorized by the Board that is equivalent to the approved high school course of study.  (Education Code 46145)

An early college high school or middle college high school may be scheduled so that students attend classes for at least 900 minutes during any five-school day period or 1,800 minutes during any 10-school day period.  (Education Code 46160)
