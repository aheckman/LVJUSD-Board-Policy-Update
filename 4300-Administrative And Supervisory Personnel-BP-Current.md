## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes that effective management is vital to the success of district students and programs.  Management personnel are expected to demonstrate initiative and good judgment in the development, implementation, and oversight of district programs.  Supervisors shall promote the productivity, professional growth, and teamwork of district staff.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45130, the district may classify certain classified positions as supervisory, administrative, or executive and then exempt any of these employees from the provisions of overtime compensation detailed in Education Code 45128.  Note that the classification of employees is a complex issue.  For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that, for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act, an employee's exempt status may be denied if the district has a policy allowing disciplinary reductions in pay for those exempt employees.  Districts should proceed cautiously and consult legal counsel as appropriate.
The Board shall adopt policies related to administrative and supervisory personnel insofar as they are needed to comply with law and describe terms of employment within the district.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 45100.5 and 45104.5 authorize the Board in all districts, including merit system districts, to adopt a resolution establishing or abolishing positions designated as senior management of the classified service.
The Board may, by resolution, establish or abolish any or all positions of the senior management of the classified service.  Any employee occupying a senior management position abolished by Board action shall become a member of the classified or certificated service in a position to which he/she would otherwise be entitled if he/she had not been in a senior management position.  (Education Code 45104.5)
