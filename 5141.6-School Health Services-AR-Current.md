The district may deliver health care services, including mental and behavioral health, for students on campus by means of telehealth technology.  (Education Code 49429)

Medi-Cal Billing

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that have contracted with DHCS in order to provide services as a Medi-Cal provider as authorized by Welfare and Institutions Code 14132.06; see the accompanying Board policy. To the extent that the district contracts with health care practitioners or clinics to provide the services, the practitioner or clinic is considered the provider of services and is the entity billing and receiving Medi-Cal payments for services.DHCS' Local Educational Agency Medi-Cal Billing Option Program (LEA BOP) reimburses LEA BOP providers, including school districts, the federal share of the maximum allowable rate for approved health-related services provided by qualified health service practitioners to Medi-Cal eligible students.Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code 14115.8 DHCS has developed program guidance, available on its website, containing information regarding processes, documentation, and the proper submission of claims under the LEA BOP.The 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (P.L. 117-159), which amended the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (42 USC 1396a), requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish best practices to support the delivery of services to students covered under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) via telehealth in schools, including mental health and substance use disorder services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, has issued guidance, "Information on School-Based Services in Medicaid: Funding, Documentation and Expanding Services," to local educational agencies and school-based entities to support the delivery of medical assistance to Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries in school-based settings and outline strategies and tools to reduce administrative burdens on, and simplify billing for, districts, in particular small and rural districts.
In order to provide services as a Medi-Cal provider, the district shall enter into and maintain a contract with the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS).  (Welfare and Institutions Code 14132.06; 22 CCR 51051, 51270)

CSBA NOTE: The federal Americans with Disabilities Act (42 USC 12101; 28 CFR 35) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 794), and state law, prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals who have speech, hearing, or vision disabilities who participate in public programs. Because discrimination is prohibited in the administration of Medi-Cal services, including determining eligibility, districts and district subcontractors must provide qualified individuals with auxiliary aides and services, including materials in alternative formats, such as braille, large font, or audio recordings, to ensure individuals can effectively communicate and participate in public programs, services, or activities including Medi-Cal. In accordance with DHCS Policy and Procedure Letters No. 21-017R and No. 23-004, districts are required, by August 1, 2023, to develop a plan to meet these alternative format requirements, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Provider Participation Agreement and Addendum, and store and maintain the alternative format plan within their audit file, which may be requested by DHCS at any time after August 1, 2023.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a plan to ensure that the district and all district subcontractors, provide individuals with speech, vision, and hearing disabilities auxiliary aides and services, to enable those individuals to effectively communicate and participate in the Medi-Cal program. Such auxiliary aides and services may include, but are not limited to, providing written materials in alternative formats, such as braille, large font, audio recordings, or closed captioning.

CSBA NOTE: With the exception of health care aides who provide specialized physical health care services pursuant to Education Code 49423.5, any practitioner whom the district employs or with whom it contracts must be credentialed to practice as a physician, registered nurse, psychologist, school counselor, or one of the other professions listed in 22 CCR 51190.3 in order for the district to receive Medi-Cal reimbursement.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all practitioners employed by or under contract with the district possess the appropriate license, certification, registration, or credential and provide only those services that are within their scope of practice.  (22 CCR 51190.3, 51270, 51491)

CSBA NOTE: Reimbursement under Medi-Cal is limited to the services specified in Welfare and Institutions Code 14132.06 and 22 CCR 51190.4 and 51360. Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code 14132.06, services may be reimbursable whether or not the student has an individualized education program (IEP) or individualized family service plan (IFSP) or whether those same services are provided at no charge to the beneficiary or to the community at large.22 CCR 51360 provides that services for accompanying a student off campus for nursing or school health aide services will be reimbursable when specified as medically necessary in an IEP or IFSP.
The Superintendent or designee shall submit a claim for Medi-Cal reimbursement whenever the district provides a Medi-Cal-eligible student under age 22 and/or a member of the student's family a covered service specified in 22 CCR 51190.4 or 51360.  (Welfare and Institutions Code 14132.06; 22 CCR 51096, 51098, 51190.1, 51190.4, 51309, 51360, 51535.5)

CSBA NOTE: Health and Safety Code 1374.722 requires a health care service plan contract issued, amended, renewed or delivered on or after January 1, 2024, that is required to provide coverage for medically necessary treatment of mental health and substance use disorders pursuant to Health and Safety Code 1374.72, 1374.721, and 1374.73, to cover the provision of the services identified in the fee-for-service reimbursement schedule published by DHCS, when those services are delivered at school sites, as defined below, regardless of the network status of the district or health care provider. Guidance to health care service plans regarding compliance with this section is required to be issued by December 31, 2023.Additionally, pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code 5961.4, DHCS is required to develop a school-linked statewide fee schedule for outpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment provided to students under the age of 25 at a school site, a school-linked statewide provider network of school site behavioral health counselors, evidence-based behavioral health programs, behavioral health services and supports virtual platform, and to award school-linked partnership and capacity grants. As part of the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative, DHCS is also required to provide incentive payments to qualifying Medi-Cal managed care plans to implement interventions that increase access to preventive, early intervention, and behavioral health services by school-affiliated behavioral health providers for children in publicly funded preschool through grade 12. More information about the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative is available on DHCS's website.
When the district provides services, or arranges for the provision of services, for treatment of a mental health or substance use disorder for a student at a school site or at an off-campus clinic, mobile counseling service, or similar district-arranged location, the district may seek reimbursement from the student's health care service plan, in accordance with the requirements of Health and Safety Code 1374.722.

The district shall maintain records and supporting documentation including, but not limited to, records of the type and extent of services provided to a Medi-Cal beneficiary in accordance with law.  (22 CCR 51270, 51476)

CSBA NOTE: 22 CCR 51270 requires federal reimbursements to be reinvested in health and social services for students and their families, as provided below. This requirement does not apply to reimbursements received under the Medi-Cal Administrative Activities (MAA) program described in the following section.
Any federal funds received by the district as reimbursement for the costs of services under the Medi-Cal billing option shall be reinvested in approved services for students and their families.  The Superintendent or designee shall consult with a local school-linked services collaborative group regarding decisions on reinvestment of federal funds.  (22 CCR 51270)

CSBA NOTE: 22 CCR 51270 requires that districts submit an annual report, as described below, as a condition of continued participation as a Medi-Cal provider. The deadline for this annual report is specified in the program provider participation agreement that districts enter into with DHCS.
The Superintendent or designee shall submit an annual report to DHCS to identify participants in the community collaborative, provide a financial summary including reinvestment expenditures, and describe service priorities for the future.  (22 CCR 51270)

Medi-Cal Administrative Activities

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that participate in the MAA program administered by DHCS pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code 14132.47. Under this program, districts providing Medi-Cal-covered health services may be reimbursed for some of their administrative and outreach costs. This section reflects program requirements described in DHCS's "California School-Based Medi-Cal Administrative Activities Manual," available on its website.Districts may receive assistance with Medi-Cal administrative billing through CSBA's Practi-Cal program. See CSBA's website for further information.
The district shall apply for reimbursement for activities identified by DHCS which are related to the administration of the Medi-Cal program. Such activities include, but are not limited to, outreach, translation for Medi-Cal services, facilitation of applications, arrangement of nonemergency and nonmedical transportation of eligible individuals, program planning and policy development, claims coordination and administration, training, and general administration.

Appropriate staff shall receive training in administrative claiming categories and related activities.

CSBA NOTE: The district must submit claims through either a local educational agency consortium (i.e., one of the service regions of the California County Superintendent Educational Services Association) or a local governmental agency (i.e., county or chartered city) that has contracted with DHCS. The district may modify the following two paragraphs to reflect the appropriate entity or agency.
To receive reimbursement for Medi-Cal administrative activities, the Superintendent or designee shall, on a quarterly basis, submit an invoice to the local educational consortium or local governmental agency through which the district has contracted.

CSBA NOTE: The MAA program requires randomly selected employees who perform MAA activities as a normal part of their job duties to complete a random-moment time study which is used to determine the work effort of all time study participants over a given time period. Further information regarding the required procedure is available on the DHCS website.
In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall submit to the local educational consortium or local governmental agency, and shall update each quarter, a roster of all employees who perform direct Medi-Cal services or administrative activities. When notified by the local educational consortium or local governmental agency of the date and time that a random-moment time survey must be conducted by a particular employee, the Superintendent or designee shall coordinate the completion and submission of the survey in accordance with DHCS timelines and procedures.

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain an audit file containing random-moment time survey documentation and other records specified by DHCS. Such documentation shall be kept for three years after the end of the quarter in which expenditures were incurred or, if an audit is in progress, until the completion of the audit.
