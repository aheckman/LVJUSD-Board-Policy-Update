## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is optional and should be modified to reflect district practice.Response to instruction and intervention (RtI2) is a strategy of organizing instruction and support resources in the general education program to help improve learning and behavioral outcomes for all students.  It allows for, based on individual student needs, early identification, intensive instruction and intervention, and progress monitoring for students who are struggling academically and/or behaviorally.Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) is described by the California Department of Education (CDE) as an integrated, comprehensive framework for districts that focuses on common core state standards, core instruction, differentiated and student-centered learning, individualized student needs, and the alignment of supports necessary for academic, behavioral, and social success.  MTSS is connected to the eight state priorities in the local control and accountability plan, and encompasses inclusive academic instruction as reflected in the California state standards and frameworks, RtI2, behavior instruction such as positive behavioral interventions and supports and restorative practices, and social-emotional learning.  Districts that have an established MTSS may integrate the RtI2 system into such framework.
The Governing Board desires to improve learning and behavioral outcomes for all students by providing a high-quality, data-driven educational program that meets the learning and behavioral needs of each student and reduces disparities in achievement among subgroups of students.  Students who are not making academic progress pursuant to district measures of performance and/or are struggling behaviorally shall receive intensive instruction and intervention supports designed to meet individual learning needs, with progress monitored.

The Superintendent or designee shall convene a team that may include, as appropriate, staff with knowledge of curriculum and instruction, student services, special education, and instructional and behavioral support, certificated personnel, other district staff, and parents/guardians to assist in designing the district's Response to Instruction and Intervention (RtI2) system, based on an examination of indicators of district and schoolwide student achievement and social-emotional well-being.

The district's RtI2 system shall include instructional strategies and interventions with demonstrated effectiveness and be aligned with the district curriculum and assessments. The Superintendent or designee may conduct ongoing screening to determine student needs, analyze data, identify interventions for students not making adequate academic progress, monitor the effectiveness of the interventions, and adjust interventions according to efficacy.

The district's RtI2 system shall include research-based, standards-based, culturally relevant instruction for students in the general education program; universal screening and continuous classroom monitoring to determine students' needs and to identify those students who are not making progress; criteria for determining the types and levels of interventions to be provided; and subsequent monitoring of student progress to determine the effectiveness of the intervention and to make changes as needed.

CSBA NOTE: CDE has identified ten core components of the RtI2 model, reflected below in Item #s 1-10.  CDE's web site contains resources for each listed component.  The remainder of this policy reflects these core components and should be modified to reflect district practice.
Additionally, the district's RtI2 system shall provide for:


	High-quality classroom instruction
	 
	High expectations
	 
	Assessments and data collection
	 
	Problem-solving systems approach
	 
	Research-based interventions
	 
	Positive behavioral support
	 
	Fidelity of program implementation
	 
	Staff development and collaboration, which may include training in the use of assessments, data analysis, research-based instructional practices and strategies and emphasize a collaborative approach of professional learning communities among teachers within and across grade spans
	 
	Parent/guardian and family involvement, including collaboration and engagement
	
	The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that parents/guardians are involved at all stages of the instructional, intervention, and progress monitoring process.  Parents/guardians shall be kept informed of the services that have and will be provided, the strategies being used to increase the student's rate of learning, the supports provided to improve behavioral difficulties, and the performance data that has and will be collected.
	
	CSBA NOTE: RtI2 may reduce referrals for special education, including a reduction in the disproportionate representation of certain subpopulations of students identified as needing special education.  As part of the state's Quality Assurance Process, CDE will examine whether districts have a disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related services that is the result of inappropriate identification.However, the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs Memorandum 11-07 states that districts have an obligation to ensure that evaluations of students suspected of having learning disabilities are not delayed or denied due to implementation of response to intervention (RTI) strategies.  Additionally, in M.M. v. Lafayette School District, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the district violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act procedural requirements by failing to ensure that RTI data was documented and carefully considered by the entire individualized education program team, and failing to provide the parents with the RTI data, resulting in the parents being unable to give informed consent for both the initial evaluation and the special education services, even when the district did not use the RTI data to determine eligibility.  See AR 6164.4 - Identification and Evaluation of Individuals for Special Education.
	Consideration of further evaluation utilizing RtI2 data
	
	The RtI2 system may be utilized as one component when considering the referral of a student for evaluation for special education or other services.
