## Policy Content

The Board of Education shall adopt written policies to convey its expectations for actions that will be taken in the District, clarify roles and responsibilities of the Board and Superintendent, and communicate Board philosophy and positions to students, staff, parents/guardians, and the community.

The Board shall ensure that District policies align with the District's vision and goals, promote student learning and achievement, provide for consistent and fair treatment of students and staff, and proactively address equity and the provision of equal access to opportunities for all students.

The Board recognizes the importance of maintaining a policy manual that is up to date and reflects the mandates of law.  Board policies are binding on the District to the extent that they do not conflict with federal or state law and are consistent with the District's collective bargaining agreements. No Board policy, bylaw, or administrative regulation, or any portion thereof, shall be operative if it is found to be in conflict with applicable federal or state law or regulations or court decisions. If any portion of a policy is found to be invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions of the policy.

Policies shall be regularly reviewed at a time allocated for this purpose on the agenda of public Board meetings.

The Board shall review certain policies annually, as required by Education Code 35160.5.  If no revisions are deemed necessary, the Board minutes shall nevertheless indicate that the review was conducted. Other policies shall be monitored and reviewed as specified in the policy itself or as needed to reflect changes in law or District circumstances.

Policy Development and Adoption Process

The District's policy development process shall include the following basic steps:


	The Board and/or Superintendent or designee shall identify the need for a new policy or revision of an existing policy. The need may arise from a change in law, a new District vision statement, new goals in the local control and accountability plan, educational research or trends, an incident that has arisen in the District, or a recommendation or request from staff, a parent/guardian, or other interested person.
	 
	As needed, the Superintendent or designee shall gather fiscal data, staff and public input, related District policies, sample policies from the California School Boards Association or other organizations or agencies, and other useful information and data to fully inform the Board about a particular issue.
	 
	The Board may hold discussions during a public Board meeting to gain an understanding of the issue and provide initial direction to the Superintendent or designee. The discussion may include, but not be limited to, community expectations, staff recommendations, and the expected impact of the policy on student learning and well-being, equity, governance, and the District's fiscal resources and operational efficiency.
	 
	The Board or Superintendent may request that legal counsel review the draft policy as appropriate.
	 
	The Superintendent or designee shall develop and present a draft policy for a first reading at a public Board meeting.  At its second reading, the Board may take action on the proposed policy. The Board may waive the second reading or may require an additional reading if necessary.

Only policies formally adopted by a majority vote of the Board shall constitute official Board policy.

The District's policy development process may be revised or expanded as needed based on the issue being considered, the need for more information, or the desire to provide greater opportunities for consultation and public input.

Policies shall become effective upon Board adoption or at a future date if so designated by the Board at the time of adoption.

Board Bylaws

The Board shall prescribe and enforce rules for its own governance consistent with state law and regulations.  (Education Code 35010)

Bylaws governing Board operations may be developed, adopted, and amended following the same procedures as those used for the adoption or amendment of Board policy.

Administrative Regulations

The Superintendent or designee shall be responsible for developing and enforcing administrative regulations for the operation of the District.  Administrative regulations shall be consistent with law and Board policy and shall be designed to promote the achievement of District goals and objectives.  Administrative regulations may describe specific actions to be taken, roles and responsibilities of staff, timelines, and/or other provisions. The Superintendent or designee may also develop procedures manuals, handbooks, or other guides to carry out the intent of Board policy.

When Board policies are amended, the Superintendent or designee shall review corresponding administrative regulations to ensure that they conform to the intent of the revised policy. In case of conflict between administrative regulation and Board policy, policy shall prevail.

The Board may review and/or approve administrative regulations for the purpose of ensuring conformity with the intent of Board policy.

Monitoring and Evaluation

At any time, the Board and Superintendent or designee may determine that progress reports to the Board on the implementation and/or effectiveness of the policy should be scheduled. If so, the Board and Superintendent or designee shall agree upon a timeline and, as applicable, measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the policy in achieving its purpose.

Access to Policies

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all District employees and the public have access to an up-to-date District policy manual. The policy manual shall be maintained electronically and/or by paper copy.

As necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall notify staff, parents/guardians, students, and other stakeholders whenever a policy that affects them is adopted or revised. He/she may determine the appropriate communication strategy depending on the issue. Policies shall be posted on the District's web site when required by law.
