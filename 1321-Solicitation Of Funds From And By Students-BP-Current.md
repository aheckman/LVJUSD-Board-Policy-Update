## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy applies to solicitations of students on behalf of the school or charitable organizations. For policy regarding solicitation of funds from and by staff members in personal profit-making ventures, see BP 4135/4235/4335 - Soliciting and Selling. For policy regarding distribution of promotional materials to students and parents/guardians, see BP 1325 - Advertising and Promotion. 
The Governing Board recognizes that student participation in fund-raising activities for the schools and nonprofit, nonpartisan charitable organizations can help develop a sense of social responsibility in students, enhance the relationship between the school and community, and contribute to the improvement of the school program.

Whether solicitations are made on behalf of the school or on behalf of a charitable organization, students shall not be barred from an event or activity because they did not participate in fund-raising.  Potential donors, including parents/guardians and members of the community, should not be unduly pressured to contribute to the school system or charitable organizations.  Staff is expected to emphasize the fact that donations are always voluntary.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that parents/guardians are informed of the purpose of fund-raisers. 

Solicitations on Behalf of the School

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51521, prior written approval is required for sales or solicitations whenever any portion of the funds raised is to be applied to the costs of the fund-raiser or to the costs of merchandise sold, such as the sale of candy or wrapping paper. Such approval is not required if the total proceeds of a solicitation are to be delivered to the school without deductions for expenses.
With the prior written approval of the Superintendent or designee, official school-related organizations may organize fund-raising events involving students. 

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional.
After the fund-raiser has been held, parents/guardians shall be informed how much money was raised and how it was spent. 

Solicitations on Behalf of Charities

CSBA NOTE: Nonprofit organizations and charities conducting fund-raising activities are subject to various state laws regarding those activities. For example, Business and Professions Code 17510.2 and 17510.3 specify that solicitations made by nonprofit community or educational organizations must comply with the state disclosure laws. Business and Professions Code 17510.3 requires volunteers over 18 years old to present potential donors or buyers with information, including the purpose of the solicitation and the address from which further information about revenues and administrative expenses may be obtained. In addition, Penal Code 320.5 provides that, prior to conducting a raffle, a nonprofit organization, unless specifically exempted, must first register with the Attorney General's Registry of Charitable Organizations and file financial disclosure reports on each raffle event.
When approved in advance by the Superintendent or designee, nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations that are properly chartered or licensed by state or federal law may solicit students on school grounds during school hours and within one hour before school has opened and one hour after school has closed.  (Education Code 51520)
