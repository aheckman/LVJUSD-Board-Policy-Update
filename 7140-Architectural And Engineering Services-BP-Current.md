## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 17266, when professional design services are used for construction or modernization of school facilities, districts are responsible for the selection of a licensed architect and/or structural engineer for necessary structural engineering and supervision of construction. Article 22 of the California Constitution allows districts to contract with qualified private entities for architectural and engineering services for all public works projects. Sample contracts are available from the American Institute of Architects, California Council.Pursuant to Education Code 17262, the district may purchase sets of plans and specifications provided by the State Allocation Board (SAB) for use in constructing a school building of the type desired by the district.
The Governing Board desires to provide school facilities that support the educational program and meet all applicable safety and design standards. When required by law, the Board shall employ or contract with a licensed and certified architect and/or structural engineer to design and supervise the construction of district schools and other facilities.

The architect and/or structural engineer shall be responsible for preparing all construction plans, specifications, and estimates and for the observation of the work of construction.  (Education Code 17302)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 17070.50 requires the California Department of Education (CDE) to review and approve plans and specifications for new construction and modernization of school facility projects funded by SAB. During this review, CDE's School Facilities Planning Division verifies project consistency with the design standards specified in Title 5 of the Code of Regulations. Pursuant to CDE forms SFPD 4.07, "Plan Submission Requirements for New Construction," and SFPD 4.08, "Plan Submission Requirements for Modernization Projects," facilities projects subject to this review include those funded through the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act (Education Code 17070.10-17079.30) and projects that receive state funding for overcrowding relief, critically overcrowded schools, career technical education facilities, joint use facilities, or modernization funding. Board-approved educational specifications must be submitted when the project involves construction of a new school or demolition and rebuilding of 50 percent or more of the existing school's square footage.Construction plans for school facility projects that are not funded by SAB are not required to be submitted to CDE for review and approval. However, locally funded projects must still comply with Title 5 design standards. Pursuant to Education Code 17251, a district may request that CDE, at district expense, review plans and specifications for locally funded school facility projects.Pursuant to Education Code 17267, all plans and specifications for school construction projects must also be filed with the Department of General Services, Division of the State Architect (DSA) to ensure compliance with Title 24 of the Code of Regulations. See DSA's website for information regarding this process.
To ensure compliance with state design and safety standards, preliminary and final plans for any state-funded school facility project, including Board-approved educational specifications for school design when necessary, shall be submitted to the California Department of Education and the Department of General Services, Division of the State Architect.  (Education Code 17267; 5 CCR 14030-14032)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 17070.50 prohibits SAB from apportioning state facilities funds unless the district has certified that the services of an architect, a structural engineer, or other design professional has been selected using a "competitive process" consistent with Government Code 4525-4529.5. Government Code 4526 requires that the competitive process must be based on demonstrated competence and on the professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required. See the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Superintendent or designee shall devise a competitive process for the selection of architects, structural engineers, and other design professionals that is based on demonstrated competence and on the professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required. For each project, the Superintendent or designee shall recommend architectural and engineering firms to the Board for approval. The Board shall pay fair and reasonable amounts warranted by the provider's qualifications and competence. The Board need not select the lowest responsible bidder.
