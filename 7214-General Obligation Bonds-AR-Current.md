## Policy Content

Election Notice

CSBA NOTE: Notice and ballot requirements for bond elections are specified in Education Code 15120-15126. Additional requirements for bond measures with a 55 percent (Proposition 39) threshold are contained in Education Code 15272. Due to the complexity of bond elections, districts are advised to consult with CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
Whenever the Governing Board orders an election on the question of whether general obligation bonds shall be issued to pay for school facilities, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that election notice and ballot requirements comply with Education Code 15120-15126 and 15272, as applicable, and the section "Ballot Materials" below.

CSBA NOTE: Since certain election officials may require delivery of the bond measure more than 88 days prior to the date of the election, districts should check with their county election officials for when the documents specified below should be delivered to the officer conducting the election.
At least 88 days prior to the date of the election, the Superintendent or designee shall deliver to the officer conducting the election the resolution calling the election, including the date and purpose of the election, the authority for ordering the election and the specification of the election order, the signature of the officer or the clerk of the Board authorized to make such designations, and all other applicable ballot materials.   (Education Code 5322)

Ballot Materials

The ballot question to appear on the ballot shall not exceed 75 words and shall appear in the form specified in Elections Code 13119.  (Education Code 5322)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the ballot materials comply with applicable laws including a brief statement of the measure setting forth the amount of the bonds to be voted upon, the maximum rate of interest, and the purposes for which the proceeds of the sale of the bonds are to be used.  (Education Code 15122)

In addition to the 75 word ballot question, a separate statement shall be included with the sample ballot, which includes the best estimate from official sources of all of the following:  (Elections Code 9401)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Elections Code 9401, as amended by SB 798 (Ch. 720, Statutes of 2023), "tax rate" means tax rate per $100,000 of assessed valuation on all property to be taxed to fund a bond issue.


	The average annual tax rate that would be required to be levied to fund the bond issue over the entire duration of the bond debt service, based on assessed valuations available at the time of the election or a projection based on experience within the same jurisdiction or other demonstrable factors
	
	The estimate shall also identify the final fiscal year in which the tax is anticipated to be collected.
	 
	The highest tax rate that would be required to be levied to fund the bond issue, and an estimate of the year in which that rate will apply, based on assessed valuations available at the time of the election or a projection based on experience within the same jurisdiction or other demonstrable factors
	 
	The total debt service, including the principal and interest, that would be required to be repaid if all the bonds are issued and sold
	
	The estimate may include information about the assumptions used to determine the estimate.

For bond measures requiring 55 percent majority of the voters, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the text of the ballot measure includes a statement that the Board will appoint a citizens' oversight committee and that annual independent audits will be conducted to assure that funds are spent only on school and classroom improvements and for no other purposes.  (Education Code 15272)

For bond funded projects that require state matching funds, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure the sample ballot contains a statement advising the voters that the project is subject to the approval of state matching funds and, therefore, passage of the bond measure is not a guarantee that the project will be completed.  (Education Code 15122.5)

CSBA NOTE: Elections Code 9170 requires the ballot label or similar description of a school district measure on a county ballot to list, either as a supporter or an opponent of the measure, the associations, nonprofit organizations, businesses, or individuals, including current or former elected officials such as board members, who have signed the ballot argument or are listed in the text of the argument for or against the measure, unless the county board of supervisors elects not to list such supporters and opponents. For more information see BP 1160 - Political Processes.
Arguments in support or in opposition of the bond measure shall be submitted in accordance with Elections Code 9160-9170.

Citizens' Oversight Committee

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that have appointed an independent citizens' oversight committee, as required by Education Code 15278 for districts that have had a general obligation bond approved under the 55 percent threshold. The section may also be adapted for use by districts that have had approval of a bond with 66.67 percent majority vote that choose to appoint an oversight committee at their discretion; see the accompanying Board policy.
If a bond is approved under the 55 percent majority threshold pursuant to Proposition 39 to the California Constitution, Article 13A, Section 1(b)(3) and Article 16, Section 18(b), then the district's citizens' oversight committee shall consist of at least seven members, including, but not limited to:  (Education Code 15282)

Members of the citizens' oversight committee shall be subject to the conflict of interest prohibitions regarding incompatibility of office pursuant to Government Code 1125-1129 and financial interest in contracts pursuant to Government Code 1090-1099.  (Education Code 15282)

No employee, Board member, vendor, contractor, or consultant of the district shall be appointed to the citizens' oversight committee.  (Education Code 15282)

Members of the citizens' oversight committee may serve for no more than three consecutive terms of two years each. They shall serve without compensation.  (Education Code 15282)

The purpose of the citizens' oversight committee shall be to inform the public concerning the expenditure of bond revenues. The committee shall actively review and report on the proper expenditure of taxpayers' money for school construction and shall convene to provide oversight for, but not limited to, the following:  (Education Code 15278)

	Ensuring that bond revenues are expended only for the purposes described in California Constitution, Article 13A, Section 1(b)(3), including the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including the furnishing and equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities
	 
	Ensuring that, as prohibited by California Constitution, Article 13A, Section 1(b)(3)(A), no funds are used for any teacher and administrative salaries or other school operating expenses

In furtherance of its purpose, the committee may engage in any of the following activities:  (Education Code 15278)


	Receiving and reviewing copies of the annual, independent performance and financial audits required by California Constitution, Article 13A, Section 1(b)(3)(C) and (D)
	 
	Inspecting school facilities and grounds to ensure that bond revenues are expended in compliance with the requirements of California Constitution, Article 13(A), Section 1(b)(3)
	 
	Receiving and reviewing copies of any deferred maintenance proposals or plans developed by the district
	 
	Reviewing efforts by the district to maximize bond revenues by implementing cost-saving measures, including, but not limited to, the following:
	 
	
		Mechanisms designed to reduce the costs of professional fees
		 
		Mechanisms designed to reduce the costs of site preparation
		 
		Recommendations regarding the joint use of core facilities
		 
		Mechanisms designed to reduce costs by incorporating efficiencies in school site design
		 
		Recommendations regarding the use of cost-effective and efficient reusable facility plans
	
	

The district shall, without expending bond funds, provide the citizens' oversight committee with any necessary technical assistance and shall provide administrative assistance in furtherance of the committee's purpose and sufficient resources to publicize the committee's conclusions. The district shall also provide the citizens' oversight committee with responses to any and all findings, recommendations, and concerns addressed in the annual independent financial and performance audits within three months of receiving the audits.  (Education Code 15280)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54952, the Brown Act open meeting laws apply to any commission, committee, board, or other body created by formal action of the Governing Board, regardless of whether that body is permanent or temporary, decision-making or advisory.
All citizens' oversight committee proceedings shall be open to the public and noticed in the same manner as proceedings of the Board. Committee meetings shall be subject to the provisions of the Ralph M. Brown Act.  (Education Code 15280; Government Code 54952)

The citizens' oversight committee shall issue regular reports, at least once a year, on the results of its activities. Minutes of the proceedings and all documents received and reports issued shall be a matter of public record and shall be made available on the district's website.  (Education Code 15280)

Reports

CSBA NOTE: The following section applies to all bond elections.
Within 30 days after the end of each fiscal year, the district shall submit to the County Superintendent of Schools a report concerning any bond election(s) containing the following information:  (Education Code 15111)

	The percentage of registered electors who voted at the election
	 
	The results of the election, with the percentage of votes cast for and against the proposition

By each January 31 following a bond issuance, the district shall submit an annual report to the California Debt Investment and Advisory Commission in accordance with Government Code 8855 and as specified in BP 3470 - Debt Issuance and Management.
