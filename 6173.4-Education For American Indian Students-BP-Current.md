## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Districts that receive federal Title VI Indian education funding (20 USC 7401-7492), which supports local educational agencies, Indian tribes and organizations, and other entities in meeting the unique cultural, language, and educational needs of American Indian students, are mandated to adopt policy and procedures to ensure that the program will be operated and evaluated in consultation with, and with the involvement of, parents/guardians and family members of American Indian students and community representatives; see the section entitled, "Title VI Indian Education Program," for more information regarding this mandate.The terms "American Indian," "Native American," and "Indian" are used in various state and federal laws but do not always refer to the same groupings of people or are not defined. For purposes of Title VI, 20 USC 7491 defines "Indians" to include Alaska natives. The following policy may be revised to reflect terminology preferred by the district and local tribes.
The Governing Board recognizes that American Indian students may have unique cultural, language, and educational needs that may be addressed by increasing student knowledge about American Indian history, including the history and culture of local tribes, and by providing American Indian students with access to education and other services necessary for such students to meet the same challenging academic standards as other students.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide all students with culturally relevant curriculum related to local American Indian tribes and implement strategies necessary for the improvement of the academic achievement of American Indian students.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraphs address the involvement of a California Indian Education Task Force. Pursuant to Education Code 33391, as added by AB 1703 (Ch. 477, Statutes of 2022), districts are encouraged to form a California Indian Education Task Force with Indian tribes local to their region, or historically located in the region, to assist in the development of curriculum related to local tribes, and in the identification of, and strategies to close, any achievement gaps between American Indian students and other students in the district.
In order to discuss, gain a shared understanding of, and develop curriculum for use within the district, and to identify the extent and nature of any achievement gaps between American Indian students and other district students, and strategies to address any such gaps, the district may form a California Indian Education Task Force with tribes local to the region. Participants in the task force meetings may consider issues of mutual concern, which include:  (Education Code 33391)

	Developing a thorough, shared understanding of accurate, high-quality curricular materials about the history, culture, and government of local tribes, and developing such materials for use within the district that include tribal experiences and perspectives
	 
	Developing a shared understanding of proper or improper instructional materials when these materials use depictions of Native Americans
	 
	Encouraging the adoption of the curriculum developed by the California Indian Education Task Force
	 
	Identifying the extent and nature of any achievement gap between American Indian students and other students, and strategies necessary to close it

If formed, the California Indian Education Task Force shall, within one year and thereafter annually, submit a report to the California Department of Education on the findings, including progress of work on Items #1-4, above.  (Education Code 33391)

The Superintendent or designee shall identify American Indian students most at-risk of not meeting state academic standards and provide to such students the needed support(s), including making referrals, as appropriate, for special education services or services under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other school-based services such as counseling and health services, supplemental instruction, before- or after-school services, and summer learning programs.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48432.5, as amended by AB 740 (Ch. 400, Statutes of 2022), provides protections for American Indian students prior to an involuntary transfer to a continuation school. Additionally, Education Code 48853.5, 48911, 48911.1, 48915.5, and 48918.1, as amended by AB 740, provide protections for American Indian students regarding suspension and expulsion proceedings and assignments to supervised suspension classrooms. In such instances, written notice must be provided to an American Indian student's tribal social worker and, if applicable, the county social worker. See AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process, AR 5144.2 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process (Students with Disabilities), AR 6173.1 - Education for Foster Youth, and AR 6184 - Continuation Education.
Suspension, expulsion, assignment to a supervised suspension classroom, or involuntary transfer to a continuation school of an American Indian student shall be in accordance with law and as specified in Administrative Regulation 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process, 5144.2 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process (Students with Disabilities), and 6184 - Continuation Education.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Labor Code 3074.2, any district planning to hold a college or career fair is required to identify approved apprenticeship programs in the county and notify such programs that they are hosting a college or career fair. See BP 6164.2 - Guidance/Counseling Services and BP 6178 - Career Technical Education.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide programs to facilitate the successful transition of American Indian students to post-secondary education and employment, which may include college and career fairs in accordance with Labor Code 3074.2, mentorship programs, and counseling services.

As needed, the Superintendent or designee shall provide professional development to teachers and other school staff to assist them in understanding and responding to the unique needs of American Indian students.

At least annually, the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board on the outcomes of American Indian students including, but not limited to, school attendance, student achievement test results, promotion and retention by grade level, graduation rates, and suspension/expulsion rates.

The majority of the committee shall be parents/guardians and family members of American Indian students. The committee shall participate in program development and provide written approval for the program. (20 USC 7424)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 7425, federal funding for American Indian education programs may be used for any of the services and activities listed in Items #1-13 below. The following list may be revised to reflect district practice.

Any federal funds received to support American Indian education programs shall be used to supplement, not supplant, state or local funds allocated for such purposes.  (20 USC 7424)

Program funds may be used to support a Title I schoolwide program pursuant to 20 USC 6314 if approved by the committee established pursuant to 20 USC 7424, provided that the schoolwide program is consistent with the purpose of American Indian education programs and the district's application identifies how the use of such funds in a schoolwide program will produce benefits to American Indian students that would not be achieved if not used in a schoolwide program.  (20 USC 7424)

As needed, professional development shall be provided to teachers and other school staff to assist them in working with American Indian students and carrying out Title VI programs.  (20 USC 7424)

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain a record of the information establishing the status of each student as an American Indian student eligible for assistance through the federal American Indian education program.  (20 USC 7427)
