## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy and administrative regulation do not address the "transfer" of an administrative or supervisory employee to an identical position at a different location. Such transfers are addressed at BP/AR 4314 - Transfers. The determination as to whether an action is a "transfer to an identical position" or a "demotion/reassignment" is complex and dependent on the facts of the situation (e.g, placement on the salary schedule). Districts should proceed cautiously and consult legal counsel as appropriate. When an administrator is to be returned to the classroom the following year, courts have held that the Governing Board must authorize the reassignment and notice must be given in accordance with Education Code 44951, as specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Governing Board may authorize the demotion or reassignment of any administrative or supervisory employee upon the recommendation of the Superintendent or designee and when such action is determined to be in the best interest of the district. 

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district complies with all applicable statutory deadlines and due process procedures when an employee is to be demoted or reassigned.
