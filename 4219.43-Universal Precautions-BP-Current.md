## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy and accompanying administrative regulation establish the expectation that all employees will observe universal precautions to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. In addition, pursuant to 8 CCR 5193(d) and 29 CFR 1910.1030, all districts with one or more employees having occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens must enforce universal precautions to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials; see BP/AR 4119.42/4219.42/4319.42 - Exposure Control Plan for Bloodborne Pathogens.Because safety conditions of employment are within the scope of bargaining pursuant to Government Code 3543.2, the district may want to consult legal counsel regarding whether components of this policy or the accompanying administrative regulation are subject to collective bargaining.
In order to protect all employees from contact with potentially infectious blood or other body fluids, the Governing Board requires that universal precautions be observed throughout the district.  Universal precautions are appropriate for preventing the spread of all infectious diseases and shall be used regardless of whether bloodborne pathogens are known to be present.

CSBA NOTE: Health and Safety Code 120880 requires districts to provide information regarding AIDS and hepatitis B, as specified below, including that the cost of a hepatitis B vaccination may be covered by the employees' health benefit plan. For employees who are identified as having occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, the cost of a hepatitis B vaccination must be borne by the district pursuant to 8 CCR 5193 and 29 CFR 1910.1030; see AR 4119.42/4219.42/4319.42 - Exposure Control Plan for Bloodborne Pathogens.Districts may also wish to provide information to employees about the hepatitis C virus and other bloodborne pathogens that may be controlled through the use of universal precautions.  The following paragraph should be modified to reflect any additional information provided to employees.
The Superintendent or designee shall distribute to employees information provided by the California Department of Education (CDE) regarding acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS-related conditions, and hepatitis B.  This information shall include, but not be limited to, any appropriate methods employees may use to prevent exposure to AIDS and hepatitis B, including information concerning the availability of a vaccine to prevent contraction of hepatitis B, and that the cost of this vaccination may be covered by the health plan of the employees.  Information shall be distributed annually, or more frequently if there is new information supplied by CDE.  (Health and Safety Code 120875, 120880)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
Information regarding universal precautions may be included in employee handbooks.

Employees shall immediately report any exposure incident or first aid incident in accordance with the district's exposure control plan for bloodborne pathogens or other safety procedures.
