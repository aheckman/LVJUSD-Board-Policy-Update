## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that regular attendance plays an important role in student achievement. The Board shall work with parents/guardians and students to ensure their compliance with all state attendance laws and may use appropriate legal means to correct problems of chronic absence or truancy.

In accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation, absence from school shall be excused only for health reasons, family emergencies, and justifiable personal reasons as specified in Education Code 48205, and work in the entertainment or allied industry as permitted pursuant to Education Code 48225.5.

When a student's absence from school is excused, the student's teacher shall determine identical or reasonably equivalent assignments and tests to those missed during the absence which the student shall be permitted to complete for full credit within a reasonable amount of time as determined by the teacher.  (Education Code 48205, 48225.5)

Student absence for religious instruction or participation in religious exercises away from school property may be considered excused subject to law and administrative regulation.  (Education Code 46014)

Inasmuch as school attendance and class participation are integral to students' learning experiences, parents/guardians and students shall be encouraged to schedule medical and other appointments during non-school hours.

Students shall not be absent from school without their parents/guardians' knowledge or consent, except in cases of medical emergency or, as authorized pursuant to Education Code 46010.1, for a confidential medical appointment.

The Board shall, by resolution entered into its minutes, approve reasonable methods that may be used to verify student absences due to illness or quarantine.  (5 CCR 421)
