## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation reflects classification and retention requirements for district records and may be revised to reflect district practice. For more information about personnel records, including the contents and retention of such records pursuant to 5 CCR 16023, see AR 4112.6/4212.6/4312.6 - Personnel Files. For additional requirements pertaining to student records, including the contents and retention of such records pursuant to Education Code 49069.7, 5 CCR 430-438, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 USC 1232g and 34 CFR 99.1-99.8), see BP/AR 5125 - Student Records. For requirements pertaining to public access to certain records in accordance with the California Public Records Act (CPRA) (Government Code 7920.000 - 7930.215), see BP/AR 1340 - Access to District Records and BB 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications.
Classification of Records

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 16020, only those documents which the district is required to prepare or retain or that are prepared or retained as part of the discharge of official duty are considered as "records" that must be classified and retained. In addition, under the CPRA (Government Code 7920.000 - 7930.215), a "public record" is defined as any writing relating to the conduct of district business that is prepared, owned, used, or retained by the district; see BP/AR 1340 - Access to District Records. Pursuant to Government Code 7920.545, emails and other electronic communications related in a substantive manner to district business are considered public records. However, documents and other writings that are not prepared or used by the district in the conduct of district business are generally not considered to be "records" and thus are not subject to the requirements of this regulation.
Records means all records, maps, books, papers, and documents of a school district required by law to be prepared or retained as necessary or convenient to the discharge of official duty.  (5 CCR 16020)

Before January 1, the Superintendent or designee shall review the prior year's records and shall classify them as either a Class 1 (Permanent), Class 2 (Optional), or Class 3 (Disposable) record.  (5 CCR 16022)

Records of a continuing nature, such as documents that are active and useful for administrative, legal, fiscal, or other purposes over a period of years, shall not be classified until such usefulness has ceased.  (5 CCR 16022)

Any historical inventory of equipment shall be a continuing record and shall not be classified until the inventory is superseded or until the equipment is removed from district ownership.  (5 CCR 16022)

A student's cumulative record, if not transferred, is a continuing record until the student ceases to be enrolled in the district.  (5 CCR 16022)

When an electronic or photographed copy of a Class 1 (Permanent) record has been made, the copy may be classified as Class 1 (Permanent) and the original classified as either Class 2 (Optional) or Class 3 (Disposable). However, no original record that is basic to any required audit may be destroyed prior to the second July 1st succeeding the completion of the audit.  (Education Code 35254; 5 CCR 16022)

Class 1 - Permanent Records

The original of each of the following records, or one exact copy of it when the original is required by law to be filed with another agency, is a Class 1 (Permanent) record and shall be retained indefinitely unless microfilmed in accordance with 5 CCR 16022:  (5 CCR 16023)

	Annual Reports
	 
	
		Official budget
		 
		Financial reports of all funds, including cafeteria and student body funds
		 
		Audit of all funds
		 
		Average daily attendance, including Period 1 and Period 2 reports
		 
		Other major annual reports, including:
		 
		
			Those containing information relating to property, activities, financial condition, or transactions
			 
			Those declared by Governing Board minutes to be permanent
			 
		
		
	
	
	Official Actions
	 
	
		Minutes of the Board or Board committees, including the text of rules, regulations, policies, or resolutions not set forth verbatim in the minutes, but included by reference only
		 
		The call for and the result of any elections called, conducted, or canvassed by the Board
		 
		Records transmitted by another agency pertaining to its action with respect to district reorganization
		 
	
	
	Personnel Records
	
	Class 1 (Permanent) records include all detailed records relating to employment; assignment; amounts and dates of service rendered; termination or dismissal of an employee in any position; sick leave record; rate of compensation, salaries, or wages paid; and deductions or withholdings made and the person or agency to whom such amounts were paid.
	
	In lieu of the detailed records, a complete proven summary payroll record for each employee containing the same data may be classified as a Class 1 (Permanent) record and the detailed records may then be classified as Class 3 (Disposable) records.
	
	Information of a derogatory nature as defined in Education Code 44031 shall be retained as a Class 1 (Permanent) record only when the time for filing a grievance has passed or the document has been sustained by the grievance process.
	 
	Student Records
	
	The records of enrollment and scholarship for each student required by 5 CCR 432 and all records pertaining to any accident or injury involving a minor for which a claim for damages had been filed as required by law shall be classified as Class 1 (Permanent) records.
	
	These include any related policy of liability insurance, except that these records cease to be Class 1 (Permanent) records one year after the claim has been settled or the statute of limitations has expired.
	 
	Property Records
	
	Class 1 (Permanent) records include all detailed records relating to land, buildings, and equipment.
	
	In lieu of detailed records, a complete property ledger may be classified as a Class 1 (Permanent) record. The detailed records may then be classified as Class 3 (Disposable) records if the property ledger includes all fixed assets; an equipment inventory; and, for each piece of property, the date of acquisition, name of previous owner, a legal description, amount paid, and comparable data if the unit is disposed of.


Class 2 - Optional Records

Any records considered temporarily worth keeping, but which are not Class 1 records, may be classified as Class 2 (Optional) records and shall be retained until reclassified as Class 3 (Disposable) records. If, by agreement of the Board and Superintendent or designee, classification of the prior year records has not been made before January 1 as specified in 5 CCR 16022, all records of the prior year may be classified as Class 2 (Optional) records pending further review and classification within one year.  (5 CCR 16024)

Class 3 - Disposable Records

All records not classified as Class 1 (Permanent) or as Class 2 (Optional) records shall be classified as Class 3 (Disposable) records. These include, but are not limited to, detailed records basic to audit, including those relating to attendance, average daily attendance, or business or financial transactions; detailed records used in preparing another report; teachers' registers if all information required by 5 CCR 432 is retained in other records or if the General Records pages are removed from the register and classified as Class 1 (Permanent) records; and periodic reports, including daily, weekly, and monthly reports, bulletins, and instructions.  (5 CCR 16025)

All Class 3 (Disposable) records shall be destroyed during the third school year after the school year in which the records originated. In addition, Class 3 (Disposable) records shall not be destroyed until after the third school year following the completion of any legally required audit or the retention period required by any agency other than the State of California, whichever is later. A continuing record shall not be destroyed until the fourth year after it has been classified as a Class 3 (Disposable) record.  (5 CCR 16026, 16027)

Electronically Stored Information

CSBA NOTE: In the conduct of official district business, many records and informational materials are generated and maintained in electronic format, making it necessary for districts to design a system for easily saving and retrieving such information when needed. The following optional section contains suggestions for the handling of such electronically stored information and may be revised to reflect district practice.In City of San Jose v. Superior Court, the California Supreme Court held that a public official's or employee's electronic communications regarding public business, even if transmitted on the official's or employee's personal account or device, are public records and are not categorically excluded from disclosure upon request under the CPRA. The court noted that the CPRA requires public agencies to use "reasonable effort" to locate existing records in response to a public records request, including those records contained on a public official's or employee's personal device regardless of whether they were transmitted through district servers. Such searches need not be extraordinarily extensive or intrusive. The following paragraph reflects the court's suggestion for ensuring that district-related communications transmitted through a public employee's or official's personal device or account can be retrieved without violating the employee's or official's privacy rights. For further information, see CSBA's, "Legal Alert: Tips for Governing Boards in Response to Public Records Act Ruling on Electronic Communications." Also see AR 3580 - District Records, BP 4040 - Employee Use of Technology, and BB 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications.
All electronically stored information related to the conduct of district business, including information created, saved, sent, or received on a district employee's or Board member's personal account or device, shall be saved as an electronic file to a district-provided account or device and retained in accordance with the section "Classification of Records" above. Such information includes, but is not limited to, email, text messages, messages sent via apps, computer files, and other electronic communications related to district business. All records, including electronic documents, should be organized and filed for easy retrieval based on information contained in, and the purpose of, the record.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Districts have the authority to monitor the use of district-owned property and equipment, including those provided to employees to enable them to perform their duties efficiently, such as computers, cell phones, and other electronic communication devices. In such situations, an employee's expectation of privacy as it relates to the equipment is limited and the district may monitor it for appropriate use. See BP/E 4040 - Employee Use of Technology.
Employees shall be required to regularly purge their email accounts and district-issued computers, cell phones, and other communication devices of personal electronically stored information and other information unrelated to district business. The Superintendent or designee may check for appropriate use of any district-owned equipment at any time.

Any person to whom a district-owned computer, cell phone, or other electronic communication device is provided shall be notified about the district's electronic information management system and, as necessary, provided training on the effective use of the device.
