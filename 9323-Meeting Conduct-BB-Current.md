## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35010 mandates the Governing Board to "prescribe and enforce" rules for its own governance. These rules must not be inconsistent with law or with regulations prescribed by the State Board of Education. The following bylaw provides suggested rules and procedures for meeting conduct and reflects provisions of law as applicable.
Meeting Procedures

All Governing Board meetings shall begin on time and shall be guided by an agenda prepared in accordance with Board bylaws and posted and distributed in accordance with the Ralph M. Brown Act (open meeting requirements) and other applicable laws.

CSBA NOTE: The law does not specify that a particular set of procedures must govern Board meetings. Although Robert's Rules of Order can serve as a useful guide, the Board may adopt any procedure that allows for the efficient and consistent conduct of meetings.
The Board president shall conduct Board meetings in accordance with Board bylaws and procedures that enable the Board to efficiently consider issues and carry out the will of the majority.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph limits the length of Board meetings and should be revised to reflect district practice.
The Board believes that late night meetings deter public participation, can affect the Board's decision-making ability, and can be a burden to staff. Regular Board meetings shall be adjourned by 10:30 p.m. unless extended to a specific time determined by a majority of the Board. The meeting shall be extended no more than once and, if necessary, may subsequently be adjourned to a later date.

CSBA NOTE: In Rubin v. City of Burbank, an appellate court held that inclusion of "sectarian prayer" at city council meetings, which communicated a preference for a particular religious faith and advanced one faith over another, was unconstitutional by directing the prayer "in the name of Jesus." The court held that it would be constitutional to require the city to advise those people conducting the prayer of this limitation. This opinion is consistent with an unpublished 9th Circuit federal court opinion which stated that an invocation "in the name of Jesus" was unconstitutional in that it displayed allegiance to a particular faith.Some general guidelines for invocations can be found in an Attorney General's opinion (76 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 281 (1993)) which stated that a county board of supervisors could open its sessions with an invocation when the invocation is (1) not required by law as a condition to the official proceedings, (2) not part of the deliberative agenda, (3) not offered, supervised, or approved as to content by a public officer, (4) not officially limited to a particular religion, (5) not disparaging of others, and (6) not directed towards proselytizing. However, because this is an unsettled area of law that is subject to frequent litigation, it is strongly recommended that districts consult CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel if they wish to open meetings with an invocation. Note that a different legal analysis applies to student-led or student-initiated prayer; see BP 5127 - Graduation Ceremonies and Activities.
Quorum and Abstentions

The Board shall act by majority vote of all of the membership constituting the Board. (Education Code 35164)

CSBA NOTE: The Attorney General opined in 61 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 243 (1978) that members of a public body have a duty to vote on issues before them so that the public is represented and receives the services which the public body was created to provide. Issues arise when a motion is tied and one Board member has abstained. The general parliamentary rule is that an abstention is counted as agreeing with the action taken by the majority of those who vote, whether affirmatively or negatively (66 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 336 (1983)). However, a stronger argument could be made that the parliamentary rule is in conflict with Education Code 35164 which requires a majority vote of all of the membership of the Board in order for the Board to act (i.e., a majority of all of the membership of the Board must vote affirmatively in order to approve any action). In 55 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 26 (1972), the Attorney General opined that, when a statutory requirement exists that requires an affirmative action of at least a majority of the members of the Board, the general rule that members not voting were deemed to have agreed with the action taken by the majority of those that voted is not applicable.The following optional paragraph is consistent with CSBA's opinion that a majority of the Board must vote affirmatively for a motion to carry, but the law is not settled and contrary legal opinions may exist. It is strongly recommended that the district consult with CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel and modify the following paragraph to ensure consistency with district practice.
The Board believes that when no conflict of interest requires abstention, its members have a duty to vote on issues before them.  When a member abstains, the abstention shall not be counted for purposes of determining whether a majority of the membership of the Board has taken action.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph applies only to districts with seven member boards and should be deleted by districts with a three or five member board.
Provided the Board typically has seven members and there are no more than two vacancies on the Board, the vacant position(s) shall not be counted for purposes of determining how many members of the Board constitute a majority. In addition, whenever any provisions of the Education Code require unanimous action of all or a specific number of the members, the vacant position(s) shall not be counted for purposes of determining the total membership constituting the Board.  (Education Code 35165)

Public Participation

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54953.3, members of the public cannot be required to register their names, complete a questionnaire, or provide other information as a condition of attending a Board meeting, except that if the meeting is conducted using remote public participating or with a Board member attending remotely pursuant to Government Code 54953, a member of the public desiring to provide comment through the use of a third party internet website or online platform may be required to register as required by the third party provider. If an attendance list or similar document is posted near the entrance or circulated during the meeting, it must clearly state that signing or completing the document is voluntary.
Members of the public are encouraged to attend Board meetings and to address the Board concerning any item on the agenda or within the Board's jurisdiction. So as not to inhibit public participation, persons attending Board meetings shall not be requested to sign in, complete a questionnaire, or otherwise provide their name or other information as a condition of attending the meeting, except that if the meeting is conducted using remote public participation or with a Board member attending remotely pursuant to Government Code 54953, a member of the public desiring to provide comment through the use of a third party internet website or online platform may be required to register as required by the third party provider.

In order to conduct district business in an orderly and efficient manner, the Board requires that public presentations to the Board comply with the following procedures:

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35145.5 mandates the Board to adopt regulations which ensure that the public can address the Board regarding agenda items, as specified below.District employees have the same right as members of the public to address the Board during a public Board meeting. In 90 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 47 (2007), the Attorney General opined that, under the Ralph M. Brown Act, an administrative district employee cannot be prohibited from attending a Board meeting or from speaking during the public comment period, including comments on an employment-related issue.


	The Board shall give members of the public an opportunity to address the Board on any item of interest to the public that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board, either before or during the Board's consideration of the item.  (Education Code 35145.5; Government Code 54954.3)
	 
	At a time so designated on the agenda at a regular meeting, members of the public may bring before the Board matters that are not listed on the agenda. The Board shall take no action or discussion on any item not appearing on the posted agenda, except as authorized by law.  (Education Code 35145.5; Government Code 54954.2)
	 
	Without taking action, Board members or district staff members may briefly respond to statements made or questions posed by the public about items not appearing on the agenda. Additionally, on their own initiative or in response to questions posed by the public, Board members or staff members may ask a question for clarification, make a brief announcement, or make a brief report on their own activities.  (Government Code 54954.2)
	
	Furthermore, the Board or a Board member may provide a reference to staff or other resources for factual information, ask staff to report back to the Board at a subsequent meeting concerning any matter, or take action directing staff to place a matter of business on a future agenda.  (Government Code 54954.2)
	 
	The Board need not allow the public to speak on any item that has already been considered by a committee composed exclusively of Board members at a public meeting where the public had the opportunity to address the committee on that item. However, if the Board determines that the item has been substantially changed since the committee heard the item, the Board shall provide an opportunity for the public to speak.  (Government Code 54954.3)
	 
	A person wishing to be heard by the Board shall first be recognized by the president and shall then proceed to comment as briefly as the subject permits.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54954.3 authorizes reasonable regulations limiting the total amount of time allocated for public testimony on particular issues and for each individual speaker. Such reasonable regulations must ensure that the intent of allowing the public an adequate opportunity to speak to the Board is carried out. The following paragraph should be revised to reflect district practice.
	In general, individual speakers will be allowed three minutes to address the Board on each agenda or nonagenda item, and the Board will limit the total time for public input on each item to 20 minutes. However, in exceptional circumstances when necessary to ensure full opportunity for public input, the Board president may, with Board consent, adjust the amount of time allowed for public input and/or the time allotted for each speaker. Any such adjustment shall be done equitably so as to allow a diversity of viewpoints. The president may also ask members of the public with the same viewpoint to select a few individuals to address the Board on behalf of that viewpoint.
	
	In order to ensure that non-English speakers receive the same opportunity to directly address the Board, any member of the public who utilizes a translator shall be provided at least twice the allotted time to address the Board, unless simultaneous translation equipment is used to allow the Board to hear the translated public testimony simultaneously.  (Government Code 54954.3)
	 
	The Board president may rule on the appropriateness of a topic, subject to the following conditions:
	 
	
		If a topic would be suitably addressed at a later time, the Board president may indicate the time and place when it should be presented.
		 
		The Board shall not prohibit public criticism of its policies, procedures, programs, services, acts, or omissions.  (Government Code 54954.3)
		
		CSBA NOTE: The following optional item addresses the issue of specific charges or complaints against district employees in open Board meetings. Although the Board may inform the speaker of appropriate district complaint procedures, it cannot prohibit criticisms of the district and its employees, no matter how harsh. Board members and staff may briefly respond to the concerns raised by the complainant at the meeting.In Baca v. Moreno Valley Unified School District, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction against the district prohibiting it from enforcing its policy barring criticism of employees at public Board meetings. The court found that the district's policy violated the plaintiff's First Amendment rights by restricting the content of her speech. The court further noted that the district could not legally prevent a person from speaking in open session, even if the speech was clearly defamatory. It is recommended that the Board consult CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel if a question arises regarding public criticism of a district employee.
		The Board shall not prohibit public criticism of district employees. However, whenever a member of the public initiates specific complaints or charges against an individual employee, the Board president shall inform the complainant of the appropriate complaint procedure.
		
		CSBA NOTE: As provided in item #7 below, Government Code 54957.9 authorizes the Board to remove persons who willfully disrupt or disturb a meeting. Examples of disruptive conduct might include conduct that is extremely loud, disturbing, or creates a health or safety risk. In McMahon v. Albany Unified School District, the court held that a speaker's constitutional rights were not violated when he was removed from a Board meeting after dumping a substantial amount of garbage on the floor of the meeting room. Because the speaker was not removed based on the content of his speech, the court upheld his conviction for a willful disruption of a public meeting. In City of San Jose v. Garbett, the court held that a legislative body may exclude from a meeting a person who has expressed a credible threat of violence that would place reasonable persons in fear for their safety or the safety of their immediate family and that serves no legitimate purpose.However, the courts have found that a person's conduct must actually disrupt the meeting in order to warrant ejection. In Norse v. City of Santa Cruz, the court held that the city council improperly ejected a member of the public who gave the council a silent Nazi salute, on the grounds that the action did not interfere with the proceedings of the meeting.
	
	
	The Board president shall not permit actual disruption of Board meetings. Actual disruption by an individual or group or any conduct or statements that threaten the safety of any person(s) at the meeting shall be grounds for the president to terminate the privilege of addressing the Board and remove the individual from the meeting.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54957.95, as added by SB 1100 (Ch. 171, Statutes of 2022), authorizes the presiding member of the Board or designee to remove an individual for disrupting a Board meeting, and establishes a procedure for warning the individual prior to removal, as specified below. However, no warning is required before removing an individual if their behavior constitutes a use of force or a true threat of force. Because of the potential impact on the public's access to open meetings, it is recommended that the Board consult CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel if a question arises regarding the procedures for removing a disruptive individual, or if an individual's behavior warrants removal from a meeting.
	The Board President or designee may remove an individual for actually disrupting the meeting. Prior to removal, the individual shall be warned that their behavior is disrupting the meeting and that failure to cease the disruptive behavior may result in removal. If, after being warned, the individual does not promptly cease the disruptive behavior, the Board president, or designee, may then remove the individual from the meeting.  (Government Code 54957.95)
	
	When an individual's behavior constitutes the use of force or a true threat of force, the individual shall be removed from a Board meeting without a warning.  (Government Code 54957.95)
	
	Disrupting means engaging in behavior during a Board meeting that actually disrupts, disturbs, impedes, or renders infeasible the orderly conduct of the meeting and includes, but is not limited to, a failure to comply with reasonable and lawful regulations adopted by a legislative body pursuant to Section 54954.3 or any other law, or engaging in behavior that constitutes use of force or a true threat of force.  (Government Code 54957.95)
	
	True threat of force means a threat that has sufficient indicia of intent and seriousness, that a reasonable observer would perceive it to be an actual threat to use force by the person making the threat.  (Government Code 54957.95)
	
	Additionally, the Board may order the room cleared if necessary. In this case, members of the media not participating in the disturbance shall be allowed to remain, and individuals not participating in such disturbances may be allowed to remain at the discretion of the Board. When the room is ordered cleared due to a disturbance, further Board proceedings shall concern only matters appearing on the agenda.  (Government Code 54957.9)
	
	When disruptive conduct occurs, the Board may decide to recess the meeting to help restore order, or if removing the disruptive individual(s) or clearing the room is infeasible, move the meeting to another location. The Board may direct the Superintendent or designee to contact local law enforcement as necessary.

Recording by the Public

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54953.5 provides that any person attending an open meeting may record it with an audio or video recorder or a still or motion picture camera unless the Board makes a reasonable finding that the recording cannot continue without noise, illumination, or obstruction of view which would persistently disrupt the meeting. Government Code 54953.6 requires a similar finding before the Board can prohibit or restrict a broadcast of its meetings.The following paragraph extends the right to record an open meeting to include recordings made by other devices such as a cell phone.
Members of the public may record an open Board meeting using an audio or video recorder, still or motion picture camera, cell phone, or other device, provided that the noise, illumination, or obstruction of view does not persistently disrupt the meeting. The Superintendent or designee may designate locations from which members of the public may make such recordings without causing a distraction.

If the Board finds that noise, illumination, or obstruction of view related to these activities would persistently disrupt the proceedings, these activities shall be discontinued or restricted as determined by the Board.  (Government Code 54953.5, 54953.6)

Note that a different legal analysis applies to student-led or student-initiated prayer; see BP 5127 - Graduation Ceremonies and Activities.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MDQyNg3" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MDQyNg3%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22UOA132%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1671043070%2C%22text%22%3A%22In%20Rubin%20v.%20City%20of%20Burbank%2C%20an%20appellate%20court%20held%20that%20inclusion%20of%20%5C%22sectarian%20prayer%5C%22%20at%20city%20council%20meetings%2C%20which%20communicated%20a%20preference%20for%20a%20particular%20religious%20faith%20and%20advanced%20one%20faith%20over%20another%2C%20was%20unconstitutional%20by%20directing%20the%20prayer%20%5C%22in%20the%20name%20of%20Jesus.%5C%22%20The%20court%20held%20that%20it%20would%20be%20constitutional%20to%20require%20the%20city%20to%20advise%20those%20people%20conducting%20the%20prayer%20of%20this%20limitation.%20This%20opinion%20is%20consistent%20with%20an%20unpublished%209th%20Circuit%20federal%20court%20opinion%20which%20stated%20that%20an%20invocation%20%5C%22in%20the%20name%20of%20Jesus%5C%22%20was%20unconstitutional%20in%20that%20it%20displayed%20allegiance%20to%20a%20particular%20faith.%5Cn%5CnSome%20general%20guidelines%20for%20invocations%20can%20be%20found%20in%20an%20Attorney%20General%27s%20opinion%20%2876%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%20281%20%281993%29%29%20which%20stated%20that%20a%20county%20board%20of%20supervisors%20could%20open%20its%20sessions%20with%20an%20invocation%20when%20the%20invocation%20is%20%281%29%20not%20required%20by%20law%20as%20a%20condition%20to%20the%20official%20proceedings%2C%20%282%29%20not%20part%20of%20the%20deliberative%20agenda%2C%20%283%29%20not%20offered%2C%20supervised%2C%20or%20approved%20as%20to%20content%20by%20a%20public%20officer%2C%20%284%29%20not%20officially%20limited%20to%20a%20particular%20religion%2C%20%285%29%20not%20disparaging%20of%20others%2C%20and%20%286%29%20not%20directed%20towards%20proselytizing.%20However%2C%20because%20this%20is%20an%20unsettled%20area%20of%20law%20that%20is%20subject%20to%20frequent%20litigation%2C%20it%20is%20strongly%20recommended%20that%20districts%20consult%20CSBA%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel%20if%20they%20wish%20to%20open%20meetings%20with%20an%20invocation.%20Note%20that%20a%20different%20legal%20analysis%20applies%20to%20student-led%20or%20student-initiated%20prayer%3B%20see%20BP%205127%20-%20Graduation%20Ceremonies%20and%20Activities.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MDQyNg3" title="CSBA NOTE: In Rubin v.

<strong>Quorum and Abstentions</strong><br>
<br>
The Board shall act by majority vote of all of the membership constituting the Board. (Education Code 35164)<br>
<br>
<div id='yMA133' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The Attorney General opined in 61 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 243 (1978) that members of a public body have a duty to vote on issues before them so that the public is represented and receives the services which the public body was created to provide. Issues arise when a motion is tied and one Board member has abstained. The general parliamentary rule is that an abstention is counted as agreeing with the action taken by the majority of those who vote, whether affirmatively or negatively (66 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 336 (1983)). However, a stronger argument could be made that the parliamentary rule is in conflict with Education Code 35164 which requires a majority vote of all of the membership of the Board in order for the Board to act (i.e., a majority of all of the membership of the Board must vote affirmatively in order to approve any action). In 55 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 26 (1972), the Attorney General opined that, when a statutory requirement exists that requires an affirmative action of at least a majority of the members of the Board, the general rule that members not voting were deemed to have agreed with the action taken by the majority of those that voted is not applicable.<br><br>The following optional paragraph is consistent with CSBA's opinion that a majority of the Board must vote affirmatively for a motion to carry, but the law is not settled and contrary legal opinions may exist. It is strongly recommended that the district consult with CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel and modify the following paragraph to ensure consistency with district practice.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MDQyNg4" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MDQyNg4%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22yMA133%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1671043093%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20Attorney%20General%20opined%20in%2061%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%20243%20%281978%29%20that%20members%20of%20a%20public%20body%20have%20a%20duty%20to%20vote%20on%20issues%20before%20them%20so%20that%20the%20public%20is%20represented%20and%20receives%20the%20services%20which%20the%20public%20body%20was%20created%20to%20provide.%20Issues%20arise%20when%20a%20motion%20is%20tied%20and%20one%20Board%20member%20has%20abstained.%20The%20general%20parliamentary%20rule%20is%20that%20an%20abstention%20is%20counted%20as%20agreeing%20with%20the%20action%20taken%20by%20the%20majority%20of%20those%20who%20vote%2C%20whether%20affirmatively%20or%20negatively%20%2866%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%20336%20%281983%29%29.%20However%2C%20a%20stronger%20argument%20could%20be%20made%20that%20the%20parliamentary%20rule%20is%20in%20conflict%20with%20Education%20Code%2035164%20which%20requires%20a%20majority%20vote%20of%20all%20of%20the%20membership%20of%20the%20Board%20in%20order%20for%20the%20Board%20to%20act%20%28i.e.%2C%20a%20majority%20of%20all%20of%20the%20membership%20of%20the%20Board%20must%20vote%20affirmatively%20in%20order%20to%20approve%20any%20action%29.%20In%2055%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%2026%20%281972%29%2C%20the%20Attorney%20General%20opined%20that%2C%20when%20a%20statutory%20requirement%20exists%20that%20requires%20an%20affirmative%20action%20of%20at%20least%20a%20majority%20of%20the%20members%20of%20the%20Board%2C%20the%20general%20rule%20that%20members%20not%20voting%20were%20deemed%20to%20have%20agreed%20with%20the%20action%20taken%20by%20the%20majority%20of%20those%20that%20voted%20is%20not%20applicable.%5Cn%5CnThe%20following%20optional%20paragraph%20is%20consistent%20with%20CSBA%27s%20opinion%20that%20a%20majority%20of%20the%20Board%20must%20vote%20affirmatively%20for%20a%20motion%20to%20carry%2C%20but%20the%20law%20is%20not%20settled%20and%20contrary%20legal%20opinions%20may%20exist.%20It%20is%20strongly%20recommended%20that%20the%20district%20consult%20with%20CSBA%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel%20and%20modify%20the%20following%20paragraph%20to%20ensure%20consistency%20with%20district%20practice.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MDQyNg4" title="CSBA NOTE: The Attorney General opined in 61 Ops.C..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

It is recommended that the Board consult CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel if a question arises regarding public criticism of a district employee.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MDQyNg9" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MDQyNg9%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22yNA138%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1671043253%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20following%20optional%20item%20addresses%20the%20issue%20of%20specific%20charges%20or%20complaints%20against%20district%20employees%20in%20open%20Board%20meetings.%20Although%20the%20Board%20may%20inform%20the%20speaker%20of%20appropriate%20district%20complaint%20procedures%2C%20it%20cannot%20prohibit%20criticisms%20of%20the%20district%20and%20its%20employees%2C%20no%20matter%20how%20harsh.%20Board%20members%20and%20staff%20may%20briefly%20respond%20to%20the%20concerns%20raised%20by%20the%20complainant%20at%20the%20meeting.%5Cn%5CnIn%20Baca%20v.%20Moreno%20Valley%20Unified%20School%20District%2C%20a%20federal%20district%20court%20issued%20a%20preliminary%20injunction%20against%20the%20district%20prohibiting%20it%20from%20enforcing%20its%20policy%20barring%20criticism%20of%20employees%20at%20public%20Board%20meetings.%20The%20court%20found%20that%20the%20district%27s%20policy%20violated%20the%20plaintiff%27s%20First%20Amendment%20rights%20by%20restricting%20the%20content%20of%20her%20speech.%20The%20court%20further%20noted%20that%20the%20district%20could%20not%20legally%20prevent%20a%20person%20from%20speaking%20in%20open%20session%2C%20even%20if%20the%20speech%20was%20clearly%20defamatory.%20It%20is%20recommended%20that%20the%20Board%20consult%20CSBA%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel%20if%20a%20question%20arises%20regarding%20public%20criticism%20of%20a%20district%20employee.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MDQyNg9" title="CSBA NOTE: The following optional item addresses t..."></annotation></li>

		<div id='MOA139' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: As provided in item #7 below, Government Code 54957.9 authorizes the Board to remove persons who willfully disrupt or disturb a meeting. Examples of disruptive conduct might include conduct that is extremely loud, disturbing, or creates a health or safety risk. In McMahon v. Albany Unified School District, the court held that a speaker's constitutional rights were not violated when he was removed from a Board meeting after dumping a substantial amount of garbage on the floor of the meeting room. Because the speaker was not removed based on the content of his speech, the court upheld his conviction for a willful disruption of a public meeting. In City of San Jose v. Garbett, the court held that a legislative body may exclude from a meeting a person who has expressed a credible threat of violence that would place reasonable persons in fear for their safety or the safety of their immediate family and that serves no legitimate purpose.<br><br>However, the courts have found that a person's conduct must actually disrupt the meeting in order to warrant ejection. In Norse v. City of Santa Cruz, the court held that the city council improperly ejected a member of the public who gave the council a silent Nazi salute, on the grounds that the action did not interfere with the proceedings of the meeting.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MDQyNg10" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MDQyNg10%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22MOA139%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1671043282%2C%22text%22%3A%22As%20provided%20in%20item%20%237%20below%2C%20Government%20Code%2054957.9%20authorizes%20the%20Board%20to%20remove%20persons%20who%20willfully%20disrupt%20or%20disturb%20a%20meeting.%20Examples%20of%20disruptive%20conduct%20might%20include%20conduct%20that%20is%20extremely%20loud%2C%20disturbing%2C%20or%20creates%20a%20health%20or%20safety%20risk.%20In%20McMahon%20v.%20Albany%20Unified%20School%20District%2C%20the%20court%20held%20that%20a%20speaker%27s%20constitutional%20rights%20were%20not%20violated%20when%20he%20was%20removed%20from%20a%20Board%20meeting%20after%20dumping%20a%20substantial%20amount%20of%20garbage%20on%20the%20floor%20of%20the%20meeting%20room.%20Because%20the%20speaker%20was%20not%20removed%20based%20on%20the%20content%20of%20his%20speech%2C%20the%20court%20upheld%20his%20conviction%20for%20a%20willful%20disruption%20of%20a%20public%20meeting.%20In%20City%20of%20San%20Jose%20v.%20Garbett%2C%20the%20court%20held%20that%20a%20legislative%20body%20may%20exclude%20from%20a%20meeting%20a%20person%20who%20has%20expressed%20a%20credible%20threat%20of%20violence%20that%20would%20place%20reasonable%20persons%20in%20fear%20for%20their%20safety%20or%20the%20safety%20of%20their%20immediate%20family%20and%20that%20serves%20no%20legitimate%20purpose.%5Cn%5CnHowever%2C%20the%20courts%20have%20found%20that%20a%20person%27s%20conduct%20must%20actually%20disrupt%20the%20meeting%20in%20order%20to%20warrant%20ejection.%20In%20Norse%20v.%20City%20of%20Santa%20Cruz%2C%20the%20court%20held%20that%20the%20city%20council%20improperly%20ejected%20a%20member%20of%20the%20public%20who%20gave%20the%20council%20a%20silent%20Nazi%20salute%2C%20on%20the%20grounds%20that%20the%20action%20did%20not%20interfere%20with%20the%20proceedings%20of%20the%20meeting.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MDQyNg10" title="CSBA NOTE: As provided in item #7 below, Governmen..."></annotation></li>

	The Board President or designee may remove an individual for actually disrupting the meeting. Prior to removal, the individual shall be warned that their behavior is disrupting the meeting and that failure to cease the disruptive behavior may result in removal.

	<em>Disrupting </em>means engaging in behavior during a Board meeting that actually disrupts, disturbs, impedes, or renders infeasible the orderly conduct of the meeting and includes, but is not limited to, a failure to comply with reasonable and lawful regulations adopted by a legislative body pursuant to Section 54954.3 or any other law, or engaging in behavior that constitutes use of force or a true threat of force. &nbsp;(Government Code 54957.95)<br>

	Additionally, the Board may order the room cleared if necessary.

	When disruptive conduct occurs, the Board may decide to recess the meeting to help restore order, or if removing the disruptive individual(s) or clearing the room is infeasible, move the meeting to another location.
