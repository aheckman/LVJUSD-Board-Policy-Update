## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Some employers have developed return-to-work plans which use temporary modified/light-duty assignments as a strategy to help reduce workers' compensation costs and to maximize employee productivity and morale.  A "temporary modified/light duty assignment" is a temporary assignment, as an alternative to the employee's regular duties, to which the employee will be assigned until he/she can return to full duty or is classified as permanently disabled. When an employee is temporarily disabled, he/she may also qualify for leave pursuant to state and federal law, such as industrial accident or illness leave (Education Code 44984 and 45192) or family care and medical leave (29 USC 2601-2654 and Government Code 12945.1-12945.2).  See AR 4161.11/4261.11/4361.11 - Industrial Accident/Illness Leave and AR 4161.8/4261.8/4361.8 - Family Care and Medical Leave.Prior to adopting this policy, districts may wish to consult with their insurance carrier, risk management program adviser, and/or legal counsel.  In addition, districts that include provisions relative to temporary/modified light-duty assignments in their collective bargaining agreement may delete or revise the following policy accordingly. The following policy is optional.
The Governing Board recognizes that, when employees have temporarily disabling medical conditions, temporary modified or light-duty assignments can allow the district to continue to use their valuable knowledge, skills, and abilities while minimizing time away from work.  Temporary modified/light-duty assignments may also serve to facilitate the employee's transition back to his/her regular duties or full-time work. 

CSBA NOTE: In Raine v. City of Burbank, a California Court of Appeal held that an employer is not obligated to convert a temporary, light-duty position into a permanent position once the temporary disability becomes permanent, if doing so would require the employer to create a new position just for the employee.  According to the court, if an employee is permanently disabled, the analysis for the employer is based on the need to provide reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 USC 12101-12213) and the state's Fair Employment and Housing Act (Government Code 12900-12996).  See AR 4032 - Reasonable Accommodation.
Any employee may request a modified or light-duty assignment when he/she has a temporary medical condition which prevents the performance of the essential functions of his/her current assignment or position.  The Superintendent or designee shall determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a suitable temporary position currently exists to accommodate the physical restrictions specified by the employee's medical provider.

CSBA NOTE: The timelines specified in the following paragraph may be modified to reflect district practice.
An employee's initial assignment to a temporary modified or light-duty position shall be for a limited duration, not to exceed 30 days.  At the end of the initial assignment, the employee may request that the Superintendent or designee extend the assignment.  When requesting any such extension, the employee shall submit documentation from his/her medical provider verifying that the employee is still temporarily disabled and is not medically able to return to his/her regular assignment.  Temporary assignments generally shall not exceed 90 days, but may be extended at the discretion of the Superintendent or designee for an additional 90 days upon verification by the employee's medical provider that such an extension will allow the employee to return to unrestricted regular duties. 

CSBA NOTE: Some workers' compensation insurance carriers require employers to create a return-to-work program; thus, employees who reject the assignment may be subject to loss of workers' compensation benefits in accordance with the district's insurance policy.
An employee who rejects a temporary modified/light-duty assignment may be subject to a loss of workers' compensation benefits in accordance with district's insurance policy.
