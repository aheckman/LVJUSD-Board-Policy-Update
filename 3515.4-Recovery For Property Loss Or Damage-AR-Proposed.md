## Policy Content

District employees shall report any damage to or loss of school property to the Superintendent or designee immediately after such damage or loss is discovered.

The Superintendent or designee shall conduct a complete investigation of any instance of damage to or loss of school property and shall consult law enforcement officials when appropriate.

When the individual causing the damage or loss has been identified and the costs of repair, replacement, or cleanup determined, the Superintendent or designee shall take all practical and reasonable steps to recover the District's costs and shall consult with the District's legal counsel and/or insurance carrier, as appropriate.

Such steps may include the filing of a civil complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover damages from the responsible person and, if the responsible person is a minor, from the parent/guardian in accordance with law. Damages may include the cost of repair or replacement of the property, the payment of any reward, interest, court costs, and all other damages as provided by law.

If the responsible person is a minor student of the District and the student's parents/guardians are unable to pay for the damages or to return the property, the District shall offer a program of voluntary work for the student in lieu of the payment of monetary damages. The District may offer any other student or former student, with parent/guardian permission, the option to provide service, work, or other alternative, nonmonetary forms of compensation to settle the debt owed as a result of property loss or damage. Service or work exchanged for repayment of a debt shall comply with all provisions of the Labor Code related to youth employment.  (Education Code 48904, 49014)

The Superintendent or designee may withhold the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts until the student's parents/guardians have paid for the damages or the voluntary work has been completed. Prior to withholding a student's grades, diploma, or transcripts, due process shall be afforded the student in accordance with law.  (Education Code 48904)

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall initiate appropriate disciplinary procedures against the student.
