## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 45125.1, as amended by AB 130 (Ch. 44, Statutes of 2021), and 45125.2 require any entity that has a contract with the district to ensure that employees who interact with students outside of the immediate supervision and control of the student's parent/guardian or school staff, have a valid criminal records summary as described in Education Code 44237.
Except in an emergency or exceptional situation, such as when student health or safety is endangered or when repairs are needed to make school facilities safe and habitable, any entity contracting with the district for services that may require the entity's employees to interact with students, outside of the immediate supervision and control of parents/guardians or school staff, shall certify to the district that each of its employees who may interact with students has a valid criminal records summary as described in Education Code 44237 and that neither the entity nor any of those employees has been convicted of a violent or serious felony as defined in Education Code 45122.1. Such contracting entity shall also be required to immediately provide the district with any subsequent arrest and conviction information received pursuant to the subsequent arrest service.  (Education Code 44237, 45125.1)

On a case-by-case basis, the Superintendent or designee may require any entity with which the district has a contract to comply with these same requirements.  (Education Code 45125.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45125.1, as amended by AB 130, the requirement for a criminal records summary also applies to any individual operating as a sole proprietor who contracts with the district. In the case of a sole proprietor, Education Code 45125.1 provides that it is the responsibility of the district to prepare and submit the sole proprietor's fingerprints to the Department of Justice.
For an individual who is operating as the sole proprietor of an entity, the Superintendent or designee shall treat the individual as an employee of the entity and shall prepare and submit the individual's fingerprints to the Department of Justice (DOJ).  (Education Code 45125.1)

Any contracting entity's employee who has been convicted of a violent or serious felony, as defined in Education Code 45122.1, shall not be permitted to interact with students unless a certificate of rehabilitation and pardon pursuant to Penal Code 4852.01-4852.22 has been submitted to the Superintendent or designee.  (Education Code 45125.1)

The Superintendent or designee may determine that criminal background checks will not be required if the contract is for the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or repair of a school facility and the contracting entity is providing services in an emergency or exceptional situation, or the district uses one or more of the following methods to ensure student safety:  (Education Code 45125.2)

	The installation of a physical barrier at the worksite to limit contact with students
	 
	Continual supervision and monitoring of all employees of the entity by an employee of the entity whom DOJ has ascertained has not been convicted of a violent or serious felony
	 
	Surveillance of employees of the entity by school personnel

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee may take appropriate steps to protect the safety of any students who may come in contact with employees of contracting entities, including, but not limited to, ensuring that the employees of such entities perform work during nonschool hours, do not work alone when students are present, have limited access to school grounds, are provided with a visible means of identification, and/or that there are regular patrols or supervision of the site from district security or personnel.
