## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes its obligation to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to students with disabilities and to uphold the rights of parents/guardians to be involved in educational decisions regarding their child.  Parents/guardians of students with disabilities shall receive written notice of their rights under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 

Whenever there is a dispute between the District and the parent/guardian of a student with disabilities regarding the identification, assessment, or educational placement of the student or the provision of FAPE to the student, the Superintendent or designee shall encourage the early, informal resolution of the dispute at the school level to the extent possible. The District or parent/guardian may also request mediation and/or a due process hearing in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation. 

The Superintendent or designee shall represent the District in any due process hearing conducted with regard to District students and shall inform the Board about the result of the hearing.

Any complaint alleging the District's noncompliance with federal or state laws or regulations related to the provision of a free appropriate public education to students with disabilities shall be filed in accordance with 5 CCR 3200-3205.
