## Policy Content

The Board of Education shall name District schools and other District-owned or leased buildings, grounds, and facilities in recognition of:


	Individuals, living or deceased, and entities that have made outstanding contributions, including financial contributions, to the school community
	 
	Individuals, living or deceased, who have made contributions of statewide, national, or worldwide significance
	 
	The geographic area in which the school or building is located

The Board encourages community participation in the process of selecting names.  A citizen advisory committee shall be appointed to review name suggestions and submit recommendations for the Board's consideration.

Any name adopted for any new school shall not be so similar to the name of any existing District school as to result in confusion to members of the community.

Before adopting any proposed name, the Board shall hold a public hearing at which members of the public will be given an opportunity to provide input.

When naming or renaming a District school, building, or facility, the Board may specify the duration for which the name shall be in effect.

Memorials

Upon request, the Board shall consider planting commemorative trees, erecting monuments, or dedicating buildings, parts of buildings, athletic fields, gardens, or other District facilities, in memory of deceased students, staff members, community members, and benefactors of the District.

Naming Rights

The Board may grant to any person or entity the right to name any District building or facility.  In doing so, the Board shall enter into a written agreement which shall:


	Specify the benefits to the District from entering into the agreement
	 
	State the roles and responsibilities of the parties to the agreement, including whether or not the Board shall retain the power to approve any proposed name
	 
	Provide details related to the naming right granted, including the building, grounds, or facility involved and the duration for which the name shall be in effect
	 
	Prohibit any message, image, or other depiction that advocates or endorses the use of drugs, tobacco, or alcohol, encourages unlawful discrimination against any person or group, or promotes the use of violence or the violation of any law or District policy
	 
	Reserve the authority to terminate the naming right if it determines that the grantee, subsequent to receiving the naming right, has engaged in any of the prohibited acts stated in item #4 above or other criminal or unlawful acts that might bring the District into disrepute
