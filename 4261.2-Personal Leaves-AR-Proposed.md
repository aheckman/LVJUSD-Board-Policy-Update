## Policy Content

Personal leaves granted to District employees shall be used as permitted in law, this administrative regulation, other Board of Education-approved policy or District regulation, or applicable collective bargaining agreement, or as otherwise required by law.

For the purpose of any personal leave offered pursuant to state law, a registered domestic partner shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits as a spouse and any protections provided to a spouse's child shall also apply to a child of a registered domestic partner.  (Family Code 297.5)

Whenever possible, employees shall request personal leaves in advance and prepare suitable instructions, including lesson plans as applicable, for a substitute employee.

Bereavement

Employees are entitled to a leave of up to five days upon the death of any member of the employee's immediate family, as defined in Education Code 44985 and 45194, and in the employee's collective bargaining agreement.

"Immediate family" means a parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, or grandchild of the employee or of the spouse of the employee, and the spouse, domestic partner, child, child-in-law, sibling, or sibling-in-law of the employee, or any relative living in the immediate household of the employee.  (Education Code 44985, 45194; Government Code 12945.7)

No deduction shall be made from the employee's salary for any authorized paid bereavement leave as specified in the collective bargaining agreement or as otherwise established by this policy, nor shall such leave be deducted from any other leave to which the employee is entitled unless requested by the employee.  (Education Code 44985, 45194; Government Code 12945.7)

At the employee's request, bereavement leave may be extended under personal necessity leave provisions as provided in the section "Personal Necessity" below.  (Education Code 44981, 45207)

Reproductive Loss

Upon request by any employee who has experienced a reproductive loss event, defined as the day or, for a multiple-day event, the final day of a failed adoption, failed surrogacy, miscarriage, stillbirth, or an unsuccessful assisted reproduction, the District shall grant the employee up to five days of reproductive loss leave, to be taken consecutively or non-consecutively. The employee shall take the leave within three months following the event. If the employee is on another type of leave at the time of the reproductive loss event, or chooses to take another type of leave immediately following a reproductive loss event, then the reproductive loss leave shall be completed within three months of the end date of the other leave.  (Government Code 12945.6)

Reproductive loss leave will be unpaid unless the employee chooses to use vacation, personal leave, accrued and available sick leave, or compensatory time off that is otherwise available to the employee.  (Government Code 12945.6)

Any request or inquiry or information provided by an employee related to reproductive loss leave and/or a reproductive loss shall remain confidential, except to internal personnel or counsel as necessary or as required by law.

Personal Necessity

Employees may use a maximum of seven days of accrued personal illness/injury leave (sick leave) during each school year for reasons of personal necessity.  (Education Code 44981, 45207)

Acceptable reasons for the use of personal necessity leave include:

	Death of a member of the employee's immediate family when the number of days of absence exceeds the limits set by bereavement leave provisions  (Education Code 44981, 45207; Government Code 12945.7)
	 
	An accident involving the employee or the employee's property, or the person or property of a member of the employee's immediate family  (Education Code 44981, 45207)
	 
	Illness, preventive care, or other need of a member of the employee's family, as defined in Labor Code 245.5  (Education Code 44981; Government Code 12945.2; Labor Code 246.5)
	 
	A classified employee's appearance in any court or before any administrative tribunal as a litigant, party, or witness under subpoena or other order  (Education Code 45207)
	 
	Fire, flood, or other immediate danger to the home of the employee
	 
	Personal business of a serious nature which the employee cannot disregard

Leave for personal necessity may be allowed for other reasons at the discretion of the Superintendent or designee. However, personal necessity leave shall not be granted for purposes of personal convenience, for the extension of a holiday or vacation, or for matters which can be taken care of outside of working hours. The Superintendent or designee shall have final discretion as to whether a request reflects personal necessity.

Advance permission shall not be required of an employee in any case involving the death of a member of the employee's immediate family, an accident involving the employee's person or property or the person or property of a member of the employee's immediate family, or the illness, preventive care, or other need of a member of the employee's family.  (Education Code 44981, 45207)

For any leave that is planned, or for which the need is foreseeable, an employee shall notify the Superintendent or designee in advance. In all other circumstances, the employee shall notify the Superintendent or designee of the need for the leave as soon as practicable.

After any absence due to personal necessity, the employee shall verify the absence by submitting a completed and signed District absence form to the employee's immediate supervisor.
