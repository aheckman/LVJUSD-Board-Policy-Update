## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 560 mandates that the Governing Board adopt policy for use by district schools in formulating individual civil defense and disaster preparedness plans.
The Governing Board recognizes that all district staff and students must be prepared to respond quickly and responsibly to emergencies, disasters, and threats of disaster. The district shall take all reasonable steps to prevent and/or mitigate the impact of a disaster on district students, staff, and schools.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 32282 requires that emergency disaster procedures, including, but not limited to, earthquake emergency procedures, be incorporated into the comprehensive school safety plan. See BP/AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan and AR 3516.3 - Earthquake Emergency Procedure System.Pursuant to Education Code 32282, as amended by SB 323 (Ch. 599, Statutes of 2023), schools are required to include in their emergencies and disaster preparedness plan adaptations for students with disabilities in accordance with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop and maintain a disaster preparedness plan which contains routine and emergency disaster procedures, including, but not limited to, earthquake emergency procedures, and adaptations for individuals with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Such procedures shall be incorporated into the comprehensive school safety plan.  (Education Code 32282)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph reflects a recommendation from the U.S. Department of Education's, "Guide for Developing High-Quality School Emergency Operations Plans," available on its website, and may be revised to reflect district practice.
In developing the disaster preparedness plan, the Superintendent or designee shall involve district staff at all levels, including administrators, district police or security officers, facilities managers, transportation managers, food services personnel, school psychologists, counselors, school nurses, teachers, classified employees, and public information officers. As appropriate, the Superintendent shall also collaborate with law enforcement, fire safety officials, emergency medical services, health and mental health professionals, parents/guardians, and students.

CSBA NOTE: In order to be eligible for reimbursement of response-related personnel costs due to a Governor-proclaimed disaster, each district must follow the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) guidelines (Government Code 8607; 19 CCR 2400-2450) to coordinate multiple-jurisdiction or multiple-agency operations. The guidelines urge districts to formally adopt policy language giving clear direction to staff to meet SEMS requirements. Districts may contact the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES) for more information.In addition, public agencies must comply with the National Incident Management System (NIMS). The Federal Emergency Management Agency's, "National Incident Management System," provides guidance to all levels of government to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats, hazards, and events ranging from traffic accidents to major disasters. In accordance with the State of California Emergency Plan, OES is the principal coordinator for NIMS implementation statewide and will annually communicate, monitor, and implement NIMS requirements in cooperation with state and local agencies.
The plan shall comply with state-approved Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) guidelines established for multiple-jurisdiction or multiple-agency operations and with the National Incident Management System.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to employees regarding their responsibilities, including periodic drills and exercises to test and refine staff's responsiveness in the event of an emergency.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 32282, a procedure to allow the use of school facilities for mass care and welfare shelters during disasters or other emergencies must be incorporated into the comprehensive school safety plan. See AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan.
The Board shall grant the use of school buildings, grounds, and equipment to public agencies, including the American Red Cross, for mass care and welfare shelters during disasters or other emergencies affecting the public health and welfare. The Board shall cooperate with such agencies in furnishing and maintaining whatever services the district may deem necessary to meet the community's needs.  (Education Code 32282)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3100, all public employees are declared to be disaster service workers. As such, in the event that a local or state emergency has been proclaimed or a federal disaster declaration has been made, district staff may be directed to perform jobs other than their usual duties for periods of time exceeding their normal working hours. In those cases, their workers' compensation insurance coverage becomes the responsibility of OES, but their overtime is paid by the district. For further information, see OES', "School Emergency Response: Using SEMS at Districts and Sites."Government Code 3100-3109 require all disaster service workers to take the oath or affirmation of allegiance to the U.S. Constitution contained in the California Constitution, Article 20, Section 3; see AR/E 4112.3/4212.3/4312.3 - Oath or Affirmation. Although Board members are required to take the same oath upon entering office (see BB 9224 - Oath or Affirmation), they are not considered disaster service workers according to the definition in Government Code 3101.
District employees are considered disaster service workers and are subject to disaster service activities assigned to them.  (Government Code 3100)
