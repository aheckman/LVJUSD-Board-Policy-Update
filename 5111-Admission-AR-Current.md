## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation is for use by districts offering transitional kindergarten (TK)-1.
Age of Admittance to Transitional Kindergarten, Kindergarten and First Grade

At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall enroll any eligible child whose fifth or sixth birthday is on or before September 1 of that year into kindergarten or first grade, as applicable.  (Education Code 48000, 48010)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48000, as amended by AB 130 (Ch.44, Statutes of 2021), revises the timespans for TK admittance requirements to be phased in from the 2022-23 school year to the 2025-26 school year. See BP 6170.1 - Transitional Kindergarten for eligibility and admission into TK.
Admission into transitional kindergarten shall be in accordance with law and as specified in BP 6170.1 - Transitional Kindergarten.  (Education Code 48000)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Education Code 48000 authorizes the district, on a case-by-case basis, to admit children into kindergarten during the school year under the conditions described below. According to the California Department of Education's "Kindergarten in California," some districts base early admission on test results, maturity of the child, or preschool records to be consistent with the early admission policy and to avoid challenge by parents/guardians whose children were denied early admission. The district might consider establishing a process for parents/guardians who choose to challenge denial of early entry.
On a case-by-case basis, and with the approval of the child's parent/guardian, a child who will turn five years old in a given school year may be enrolled in kindergarten at any time during that school year provided that:  (Education Code 48000)

	The Governing Board determines that admittance is in the best interest of the child.
	 
	The parent/guardian is given information regarding the advantages and disadvantages and any other explanatory information about the effect of this early admittance.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall make a recommendation to the Board regarding whether a child should be granted early entry to kindergarten, as appropriate. In doing so, the Superintendent or designee shall consider various factors including the availability of classroom space and any negotiated maximum class size.

Documentation of Age/Grade

Prior to the admission of a child to kindergarten or first grade, the parent/guardian shall present proof of the child's age.  (Education Code 48002)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48002 specifies that the method of proof of age may include any appropriate means prescribed by the Governing Board. The following items reflect examples in Education Code 48002 and may be revised to reflect district practice.Although Education Code 48002 includes a passport as a possible means for determining a child's age, the California Attorney General's model policy developed pursuant to Education Code 234.7 states that districts should not require documentation that may indicate a student's national origin or immigration status, such as a passport, to the exclusion of other permissible documentation. In addition, a district may not bar or discourage a child from enrolling in school because the child lacks a birth certificate or passport, or has one from a foreign country. See the Office of the Attorney General's publication "Promoting a Safe and Secure Learning Environment for All: Guidance and Model Policies to Assist California's K-12 Schools in Responding to Immigration Issues."
Evidence of the child's age may include:  (Education Code 48002) 

	A certified copy of a birth certificate or a statement by the local registrar or county recorder certifying the date of birth
	 
	A duly attested baptism certificate
	 
	A passport
	 
	When none of the above documents is obtainable, an affidavit of the parent/guardian
	 
	Other means prescribed by the Board
