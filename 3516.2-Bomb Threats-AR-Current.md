## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation may be revised to reflect district practice.6 USC 665k, as added by the Luke and Alex School Safety Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-159), requires the creation of a Federal Clearinghouse on School Safety Evidence-Based Practices to serve as a federal resource to identify and publish online evidence-based practices and recommendations to improve school safety.
To maintain a safe and secure environment for district students and staff, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's emergency and disaster preparedness plan and/or each school's comprehensive safety plan includes procedures for managing bomb threats.  Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall regularly review current guidance regarding cybersecurity and digital media awareness and incorporate recommended practices into the district's processes and procedures related to the protection of the district's infrastructure, and the monitoring and response to suspicious and/or threatening digital media content.

Receiving Threats

CSBA NOTE: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) web site provides a, "Bomb Threat Checklist," that can assist in preparing and reacting appropriately to a bomb threat.
Any staff member receiving a bomb threat by telephone shall try to keep the caller on the line for as long as possible in order to gather information about the location and timing of the bomb and the person(s) responsible.  To the extent possible, the staff member should also take note of the caller's gender, age, any distinctive features of voice or speech, and any background noises such as music, traffic, machinery, or voices. The staff member should not hang up, even if the caller does, and copy the number and/or letters on the telephone's display, if available.

If the bomb threat is received through regular mail or in writing, the staff member who receives it should handle the letter, note, or package as minimally as possible.  If the threat is received through electronic means, such as email, text messaging, or social media, the staff member should not delete the message.

Response Procedure

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section includes recommendations from DHS', "Bomb Threat Guidance," and may be deleted if such a procedure is already provided in the district's emergency and disaster preparedness plan; see BP/AR 3516 - Emergencies and Disaster Preparedness Plan.Education Code 49390 and 49393, as added by SB 906 (Ch. 144, Statutes of 2022), require certificated and classified employees of the district, or other school officials such as Governing Board members, whose duties bring the employee or other school official in contact on a regular basis with students in any of grades 6-12, as part of a middle school or high school, who are alerted to or observe any threat or perceived threat of a homicidal act, as defined, to immediately report the threat or perceived threat to law enforcement in accordance with Education Code 49393. "Threat or perceived threat" means any writing or action of a student that creates a reasonable suspicion that the student is preparing to commit a homicidal act related to school or a school activity. This may include possession, use, or depictions of firearms, ammunition, shootings, or targets in association with infliction of physical harm, destruction, or death in a social media post, journal, class note, or other media associated with the student. It may also include a warning by a parent, student, or other individual.Districts are encouraged to consult with the California Office of Emergency Services (OES) and utilize resources such as the State Threat Assessment System and Regional Fusion Centers to help assess potential threats. For more information see OES' web site.
The following procedure shall be followed when a bomb threat is received:

	Any employee or other school official who receives a bomb threat shall immediately call 911 and report the threat or perceived threat to law enforcement. The employee shall also report the threat to the Superintendent or designee.
	
	If the threat is in writing, the employee shall rewrite the threat exactly as is on another sheet of paper, including the date, time and location the document was found, any conditions surrounding the discovery or delivery of the document, and the full names of any other employees who saw the threat. The employee shall secure the document and not alter it in any way. If the document is small and/or removable, the employee shall place it in a bag or envelope.
	
	If the threat is electronic, the employee shall leave the message open, and print, photograph, or copy the message and subject line, and note the date and time of the message.
	 
	Any student or employee who sees a suspicious package should not touch, tamper with, or move the item, and shall immediately notify law enforcement and the Superintendent or designee.
	 
	The Superintendent or designee shall immediately contact law enforcement if not yet done, assess the situation, ensure the area is secured, and initiate standard evacuation procedures as specified in the emergency plan.
	 
	The Superintendent or designee shall turn off any two-way radio equipment which is located in a threatened building.

Law enforcement and/or fire department staff shall conduct the bomb search.  No school staff, students, parents/guardians, or others on campus shall search for or handle any explosive or incendiary device.

No one shall reenter the threatened building(s) until the Superintendent or designee declares that reentry is safe based on law enforcement and/or fire department clearance.

To the extent possible, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain communications with staff, parents/guardians, the Governing Board, other governmental agencies, and the media during the period of the incident.

Following the incident, the Superintendent or designee shall provide crisis counseling for students and/or staff as needed.

Any employee or student found to have made a bomb threat shall be subject to disciplinary procedures and/or criminal prosecution.

Staff Training

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training regarding the assessment and reporting of potential threats and procedures for managing bomb threats to district and site administrators, safety personnel, teachers, and other staff members, as appropriate.
