## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy addresses the selection of instructional materials that are used to supplement the basic textbooks and other instructional materials adopted by the Governing Board for use in grades K-8 pursuant to Education Code 60200 or for grades 9-12 pursuant to Education Code 60400. See BP/AR 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials for requirements pertaining to the selection of those basic instructional materials.
The Governing Board encourages the use of supplementary instructional materials to enrich the curriculum and enhance student learning. Such materials shall be aligned with district goals, curriculum objectives, and academic standards and shall supplement and not supplant the use of Board-adopted basic instructional materials that serve as the primary learning resources.

Supplementary instructional materials include, but are not limited to, instructional materials that are designed to serve one or more of the following purposes:  (Education Code 60010)

	To provide more complete coverage of one or more subjects included in a given course
	 
	To meet the various learning ability levels of students in a given age group or grade level
	 
	To meet the diverse educational needs of students with a language disability in a given age group or grade level
	 
	To meet the diverse educational needs of students reflective of a condition of cultural pluralism
	 
	To use current, relevant technology that further engages interactive learning in the classroom and beyond

Supplementary instructional materials may be selected by the Superintendent or designee, school administrators, or teachers, as applicable, and obtained through donations to the district and/or available funding sources designated for these purposes.

CSBA NOTE: In McCarthy v. Fletcher, a California appellate court clarified that the Board may exclude materials from classroom teaching because they are educationally unsuitable and unrelated to the goals specified in Education Code 233.5, but not simply because the materials contain ideas to which Board or community members object.Education Code 243, as added by AB 1078 (Ch. 229, Statutes of 2023), clarifies when it is unlawful discrimination for the Board to (1) refuse to approve the use of any supplemental instructional material or (2) prohibit the use of any supplemental instructional material. The Board may not refuse to approve the use of any supplemental instructional material on the basis that the material includes a study of the role and contributions of specified individuals or groups, unless the study of the role and contributions reflects adversely upon legally protected groups. Additionally, the Board may not prohibit the use of any supplemental instructional material on the basis that the study of the role and contributions contain inclusive or diverse perspectives.For more information, the California Department of Education's (CDE) website provides guidance on the removal of instruction or instructional materials. In addition, Education Code 60040.5, as added by AB 1078, requires CDE to issue, no later than July 1, 2025, guidance regarding how to review instructional materials to ensure that they represent diverse perspectives and are culturally relevant. Additionally, Education Code 242, as added by AB 1078, requires CDE to develop, by July 1, 2025, guidance and public educational materials to ensure that all Californians can access information about educational laws and policies that safeguard the right to an accurate and inclusive curriculum.
The use of any supplemental instructional material shall not be rejected or prohibited by the Board or district on the basis that it includes a study of the role and contributions of any individual or group consistent with the requirements of Education Code 51204.5 and 60040, unless such study would violate Education Code 51501 or 60044.  (Education Code 243)

As appropriate, supplementary instructional materials shall meet the criteria developed for the selection and evaluation of basic instructional materials as described in AR 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials.

Supplementary instructional materials shall be directly related to the course of study in which they are being used and shall be appropriate for the age and maturity level of the students.

The use or reproduction of supplementary instructional materials shall be in accordance with federal copyright law.

Appropriateness of Materials

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice, including any district criteria for the appropriateness of supplementary instructional materials and/or circumstances under which materials should be submitted to the principal or other designee for review prior to their use (e.g., when materials relate to controversial issues or are presented in a controversial manner or context, such as when materials contain nudity, sexual content, graphic violence, or extensive profanity). The district is encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel prior to adopting such criteria or processes or when banning films, electronic resources, or other materials solely on the basis of industry ratings.
Whenever a district employee proposes to use a supplementary resource which is not included in the approved learning resources of the district, the employee shall preview the material to determine whether, in the employee's professional judgment, it is appropriate for the grade level taught and is consistent with district criteria for the selection of supplementary instructional materials.

The employee shall confer with the Superintendent or designee as necessary to determine the compliance of the material with district criteria. The primary considerations should be the educational value, factual accuracy, appropriateness, including whether the material contains pervasive vulgarity or profanity, and relevance of the materials, as well as the ages and maturity of the students.

The Superintendent or designee may provide training to administrators and teachers in the selection and evaluation of supplementary instructional materials, including the criteria to be utilized and applicable legal considerations.

Complaints

CSBA NOTE: Complaints alleging discrimination based on a violation of Education Code 243, as added by AB 1078, related to the use or prohibited use of any supplemental instructional material as described above, may be brought under the district's uniform complaint procedures or may be filed directly with the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI). Complaints that are filed directly with the SPI are required to identify the basis for doing so, and present evidence that supports the basis for the direct filing. In such cases, the SPI may directly intervene without waiting for an investigation by the district. See BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.
Complaints concerning supplemental instructional materials shall be handled in accordance with Board Policy 1312.2 - Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials and Board Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, as applicable.
