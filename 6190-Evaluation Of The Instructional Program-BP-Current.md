## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board recognizes that it is accountable to students, parents/guardians, and the community for the effectiveness of the district's educational program in meeting district goals for student learning. The Superintendent or designee shall conduct a continual evaluation of the curriculum and the instructional program in order to identify strategies for improving student achievement.

CSBA NOTE: The district may revise the following paragraph to specify the data and reports that will be used to evaluate the district's instructional program.Education Code 52060-52061 require that the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) establish goals, for all students and for each numerically significant subgroup, that are aligned with the state priorities, and that the district annually review progress toward the goals; see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, numerically significant student subgroups include ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and homeless students, when the subgroup consists of at least 30 students with a valid test score or 15 foster or homeless youth. The California School Dashboard reports the status of district and school performance on multiple state and local indicators and is intended to assist districts in identifying strengths and areas in need of improvement in each priority area addressed by the LCAP.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board and the community with regular reports on student achievement. The reports shall include data for each district school and for each numerically significant student subgroup, as defined in Education Code 52052, including, but not limited to, school and subgroup performance on statewide achievement indicators and progress toward goals specified in the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP).

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct an evaluation of any new instructional program implemented in the district and shall regularly assess district progress toward increasing student achievement in all subject areas taught in the district. The findings of such evaluations and assessments shall be reported to the Board.

Based on these reports, the Board shall take appropriate actions to maintain the effectiveness of programs and to improve the quality of education provided to district students.

Annual Evaluation of Consolidated Application Programs

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section should be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 64000-64001, the consolidated application is used by the California Department of Education to distribute funds from certain federal categorical programs. Pursuant to 5 CCR 3942, as a condition of receiving continued funding for these programs, the district must make certain general assurances and certifications, including an assurance that the district's annual evaluation of categorical programs demonstrates that each program is "not one of low effectiveness." The district does not need to sign or return the general assurances, but does need to keep them on file for compliance reviews, complaint investigations, or audits.Pursuant to 5 CCR 3942, criteria for the annual program evaluation are to be established by the Governing Board. The district may consider measures of the academic progress of students participating in the program, including numerically significant student groups, in addition to other measures contained in school plans or adopted by the Board.
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall annually determine whether the district's categorical programs funded through the state's consolidated application are effective in meeting the needs of the students they are intended to serve. As a basis for this evaluation, the Superintendent or designee shall recommend for Board approval the specific, measurable criteria that shall be used at each school and at the district level. These criteria may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the progress of all students participating in the program and of each numerically significant subgroup toward goals contained in the district's LCAP, the school's single plan for student achievement, and/or other applicable district or school plans.

Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) Accreditation

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that participate in the evaluation process leading to accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). WASC is a private, nonprofit organization whose Accrediting Commission for Schools provides regular assessments of public and private schools in order to support ongoing improvement of the educational program. The term of the accreditation process varies from one to six years, as determined by WASC. Districts may seek accreditation for both elementary and secondary schools and may revise the following section to specify schools that will seek accreditation (e.g., only secondary schools and/or middle schools). Districts also may revise the following section to apply to any other accrediting agency.
The Board believes that accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) can foster excellence and ongoing academic improvement in the district's schools. The results of the accreditation process also may demonstrate to parents/guardians and the community that the schools are meeting their goals and objectives and the WASC criteria for school effectiveness through a viable instructional program.

The Superintendent or designee shall undertake procedures whereby district schools may achieve and maintain full WASC accreditation status. The schools shall conduct a self-study in accordance with WASC requirements, cooperate with the WASC committee during a site visit, and develop and review action plans to increase the effectiveness of the instructional program for students. The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board on the status of district schools and any WASC recommendations for school improvement.

Not later than 60 days after receiving the results of an inspection of a school by WASC or any other accrediting agency, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians in writing of the inspection results and/or shall post the information on the district's or school's web site.  (Education Code 35178.4)

If any district school loses its accreditation status, the Board shall give official notice at a regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Superintendent or designee shall provide written notification to each parent/guardian of a student in the school that the school has lost its accreditation status, including the potential consequences of the loss of accreditation status. This notice shall also be posted on the district's web site and the school's web site.  (Education Code 35178.4)
