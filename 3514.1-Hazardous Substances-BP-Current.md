## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board desires to provide a safe school environment that protects students and employees from exposure to any potentially hazardous substances used in the district's educational program and in the maintenance and operation of district facilities and equipment.

Insofar as reasonably possible, the Superintendent or designee shall minimize the quantities of hazardous substances stored and used on school property. When hazardous substances must be used, the Superintendent or designee shall give preference to materials that cause the least risk to people and the environment.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49401.5, districts may request consultation services from the Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health, to ensure that hazardous materials are being used and stored safely in schools. See the accompanying administrative regulation for legal requirements related to storage and disposal of hazardous substances.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all potentially hazardous substances on district properties are inventoried, used, stored, and regularly disposed of in a safe and legal manner.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop, implement, and maintain a written hazard communication program in accordance with 8 CCR 5194 and shall ensure that employees, students, and others as necessary are fully informed about the properties and potential hazards of substances to which they may be exposed.

CSBA NOTE:  The following paragraph is for use by districts that offer science laboratory classes, at any grade level, that expose employees to hazardous substances. Pursuant to 8 CCR 5191, any employer that maintains a workplace where there is laboratory use of hazardous chemicals (i.e., where relatively small quantities of hazardous chemicals are used but not produced) is required to have a written chemical hygiene plan to protect employees. See the accompanying administrative regulation for required program components.In addition, Education Code 49340-49341 encourage educational efforts to increase awareness of students and staff dealing with hazardous materials in school laboratories in order to minimize injuries, loss of property, and classroom disruptions. For further information about safe handling of potentially hazardous substances in science laboratory classes, see the California Department of Education's Science Safety Handbook for California Public Schools.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop specific measures to ensure the safety of students and staff in school laboratories where hazardous chemicals are used. Such measures shall include the development and implementation of a chemical hygiene plan in accordance with 8 CCR 5191 and instruction to students about proper handling of hazardous substances.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect the grade levels offered by the district. Education Code 32064 prohibits the use of arts and crafts materials containing toxic substances in grades K-6, and requires that any materials with toxic substances used in grades 7-12 meet specified labeling standards that inform users of the long-term health risks and provide instructions for safe use. For additional information and a list of materials prohibited in grades K-6, see the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment publication Art and Craft Materials in Schools: Guidelines for Purchasing and Safe Use.
The Superintendent or designee shall not order or purchase for use in grades K-6 any arts and crafts materials containing a substance determined by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to be toxic. The Superintendent or designee shall not purchase any such toxic material for use in grades 7-12 unless it includes a warning label as specified in Education Code 32065 that identifies any toxic ingredients, warns of potential adverse health effects, and describes procedures for safe use and storage.  (Education Code 32064)
