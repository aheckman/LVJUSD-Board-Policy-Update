## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to facilitate work-based learning opportunities which link classroom learning with real-world experiences. The District or the Regional Occupational Center/Program's (ROC/P) work-based learning program shall be designed to teach students the skills, attitudes, and knowledge necessary for successful employment and to reinforce mastery of both academic and career technical education (CTE) standards.

The District's work-based learning program may offer opportunities for paid and/or unpaid work experiences, including, but not limited to:


	Work experience education as defined in Education Code 51764
	 
	Cooperative CTE or community classrooms as defined in Education Code 52372.1
	 
	Job shadowing experience as defined in Education Code 51769
	 
	Student internships
	 
	Apprenticeships
	 
	Service learning
	 
	Employment in social/civic or school-based enterprises
	 
	Technology-based or other simulated work experiences

The Superintendent or designee may provide students employment opportunities with public and private employers in areas within or outside the District, including in any contiguous state. (Education Code 51768)

The Board may elect to pay wages to students participating in a work-based learning program, but shall not make payments to or for private employers except for students with disabilities who are participating in work experience education programs funded by the state for such students. (Education Code 51768)

Any District plan for work-based learning shall be submitted to the Board for approval. When required, the plan shall be submitted to the California Department of Education or other state agency or official.

The Superintendent or designee shall involve local businesses or business organizations in planning and implementing work-based learning opportunities that support the District's vision and goals for student learning and local workforce development efforts.  He/she also may work with postsecondary institutions, community organizations, and others to identify opportunities for work-based learning.

When required by law, the Superintendent or designee shall develop a written training agreement with the employer that describes the conditions and requirements to be met by all parties and shall develop an individual training plan for each student which outlines the objectives or competencies that the student is expected to accomplish at the work site.  (5 CCR 10070-10071, 10087, 10108)

To ensure appropriate guidance and supervision of participating students and maximize the educational benefit from placement in any work-based learning program, District staff shall coordinate with the workplace supervisors or mentors.

A minor student shall be allowed employment through a paid work-based learning program only if he/she has been issued a work permit, in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation. (Education Code 49113, 49160)

All laws or rules applicable to minors in employment relationships shall be applicable to students enrolled in work-based learning programs.  (Education Code 51763)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any student participating in a work-based learning program off school grounds is covered under the employer's or District's insurance, as applicable, in the event the student is injured.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any teacher-coordinator of a work-based learning program possesses the appropriate credential issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.  (5 CCR 10075, 10080, 10100)

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records related to each student's participation in the District's work-based learning program, including, but not limited to, the student's individualized training plan, employment hours and job site, work permit if applicable, the employer's report of student's attendance and job performance, the teacher-coordinator's consultations and observations, and reports of the student's grade and credits earned.

The Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Board regarding program implementation and effectiveness, including, but not limited to, rates of student participation in work-based learning programs and assessment results of participating students.
