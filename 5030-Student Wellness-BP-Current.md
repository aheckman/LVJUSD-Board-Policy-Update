## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (42 USC 1758b) mandates each district participating in the National School Lunch Program (42 USC 1751-1769j) or any program in the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 USC 1771-1793), including the School Breakfast Program, to adopt a districtwide school wellness policy. The following policy fulfills this mandate and should be revised to reflect district practice. Other policies in the district's policy manual will likely contain additional provisions supporting this wellness policy, such as BP 3312 - Contracts, BP/AR 3550 - Food Service/Child Nutrition Program, BP/AR 3552 - Summer Meal Program, BP/AR 3553 - Free and Reduced Price Meals, BP/AR 3554 - Other Food Sales, BP/AR 6142.7 - Physical Education and Activity, and BP/AR 6142.8 - Comprehensive Health Education.Although the Governing Board has discretion under 42 USC 1758b to determine specific policies appropriate for its schools, 7 CFR 210.31, as renumbered by 81 Fed. Reg. 93792, provides a framework and guidelines to assist districts in establishing their student wellness policies, including minimum content requirements, assurance of stakeholder participation in the development and updates, and periodic assessment and disclosure of compliance with the district's wellness policy. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide resources and implementation tools on their web sites. In addition, CSBA's Student Wellness: A Healthy Food and Physical Activity Policy Resource Guide summarizes research on the relationship between nutrition and physical activity and student achievement, provides worksheets for policy development, and contains other resources that may be useful in the development of the wellness policy.The following paragraph links student wellness with the components of a coordinated school health approach recommended in the California Department of Education's (CDE) Health Framework for California Public Schools and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board recognizes the link between student health and learning and desires to provide a comprehensive program promoting healthy eating and physical activity for district students. The Superintendent or designee shall coordinate and align district efforts to support student wellness through health education, physical education and activity, health services, nutrition services, psychological and counseling services, and a safe and healthy school environment. In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for promoting staff wellness and for involving parents/guardians and the community in reinforcing students' understanding and appreciation of the importance of a healthy lifestyle.

School Wellness Council

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 1758b and 7 CFR 210.31 require that districts permit specified stakeholders to participate in the development, implementation, and periodic review and update of the district's wellness policy. One method to achieve continuing involvement of those groups and other key stakeholders is through the creation of a school wellness council, as recommended in the CDE's Health Framework for California Public Schools. Pursuant to Government Code 54952, committees created by formal action of the Board are subject to open meeting laws (the Brown Act); see AR 1220 - Citizen Advisory Committees.
The Superintendent or designee shall encourage parents/guardians, students, food service employees, physical education teachers, school health professionals, Board members, school administrators, and members of the public to participate in the development, implementation, and periodic review and update of the district's student wellness policy.  (42 USC 1758b; 7 CFR 210.31)

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
To fulfill this requirement, the Superintendent or designee may appoint a school wellness council or other district committee and a wellness council coordinator. The council may include representatives of the groups listed above, as well as health educators, curriculum directors, counselors, before- and after-school program staff, health practitioners, and/or others interested in school health issues.

The Superintendent or designee may make available to the public and school community a list of the names, position titles, and contact information of the wellness council members.

The wellness council shall advise the district on health-related issues, activities, policies, and programs. At the discretion of the Superintendent or designee, the duties of the council may also include the planning, implementation, and evaluation of activities to promote health within the school or community.

Goals for Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Other Wellness Activities

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 1758b and 7 CFR 210.31 mandate that the district's wellness policy include goals for the activities specified below.
The Board shall adopt specific goals for nutrition promotion and education, physical activity, and other school-based activities that promote student wellness. In developing such goals, the Board shall review and consider evidence-based strategies and techniques.  (42 USC 1758b; 7 CFR 210.31)

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section provides policy language to address this mandated topic and should be revised to reflect district practice.
The district's nutrition education and physical education programs shall be based on research, shall be consistent with the expectations established in the state's curriculum frameworks and content standards, and shall be designed to build the skills and knowledge that all students need to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

The nutrition education program shall include, but is not limited to, information about the benefits of healthy eating for learning, disease prevention, weight management, and oral health.  Nutrition education shall be provided as part of the health education program and, as appropriate, shall be integrated into other academic subjects in the regular educational program, before- and after-school programs, summer learning programs, and school garden programs.

All students shall be provided opportunities to be physically active on a regular basis. Opportunities for moderate to vigorous physical activity shall be provided through physical education and recess and may also be provided through school athletic programs, extracurricular programs, before- and after-school programs, summer learning programs, programs encouraging students to walk or bicycle to and from school, in-class physical activity breaks, and other structured and unstructured activities.

The Board may enter into a joint use agreement or memorandum of understanding to make district facilities or grounds available for recreational or sports activities outside the school day and/or to use community facilities to expand students' access to opportunity for physical activity.

Professional development may be regularly offered to the nutrition program director, managers, and staff, as well as health education teachers, physical education teachers, coaches, activity supervisors, and other staff as appropriate to enhance their knowledge and skills related to student health and wellness.

In order to ensure that students have access to comprehensive health services, the district may provide access to health services at or near district schools and/or may provide referrals to community resources.

The Board recognizes that a safe, positive school environment is also conducive to students' physical and mental health and thus prohibits bullying and harassment of all students, including bullying on the basis of weight or health condition.

The Superintendent or designee shall encourage staff to serve as positive role models for healthy eating and physical fitness. He/she shall promote work-site wellness programs and may provide opportunities for regular physical activity among employees.

Nutrition Guidelines for All Foods Available at School

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 1758b mandates that the district's wellness policy include nutrition guidelines that are consistent with federal nutrition standards, as specified below. Also see AR 3550 - Food Service/Child Nutrition Program.
For all foods and beverages available on each campus during the school day, the district shall adopt nutrition guidelines which are consistent with 42 USC 1758, 1766, 1773, and 1779 and federal regulations and which support the objectives of promoting student health and reducing childhood obesity.  (42 USC 1758b)

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section provides policy language to address this mandated topic and should be revised to reflect district practice.
In order to maximize the district's ability to provide nutritious meals and snacks, all district schools shall participate in available federal school nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs and after-school snack programs, to the extent possible. When approved by the California Department of Education, the district may sponsor a summer meal program.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 42 USC 1758, schools participating in the National School Lunch Program are required to make free drinking water available for consumption at locations where meals are served during meal service. In addition, Education Code 38086 requires all California schools to make free drinking water available during school meal times, unless the Board adopts a resolution demonstrating that the district is unable to comply due to fiscal constraints or health or safety concerns. See AR 3550 - Food Service/Child Nutrition Program for policy language related to these requirements. Also see CSBA's policy brief Increasing Access to Drinking Water in Schools for further information and sample strategies for providing water and encouraging consumption. Information on potential funding sources to comply with the potable water requirement is available on the CDE web site.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide access to free, potable water in the food service area during meal times in accordance with Education Code 38086 and 42 USC 1758, and shall encourage students' consumption of water by educating them about the health benefits of water and by serving water in an appealing manner.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 7 CFR 210.31, districts are mandated to include, within the wellness policy, standards for all foods and beverages which are made available to students outside the district's food services program (e.g., sales through vending machines, student stores, and fundraisers). Nutrition standards and other requirements pertaining to such food sales are addressed in AR 3554 - Other Food Sales.
The Board believes that all foods and beverages sold to students at district schools, including those available outside the district's reimbursable food services program, should support the health curriculum and promote optimal health. Nutrition standards adopted by the district for foods and beverages provided through student stores, vending machines, or other venues shall meet or exceed state and federal nutrition standards.

The Superintendent or designee shall encourage school organizations to use healthy food items or non-food items for fundraising purposes.

He/she also shall encourage school staff to avoid the use of non-nutritious foods as a reward for students' academic performance, accomplishments, or classroom behavior.

School staff shall encourage parents/guardians or other volunteers to support the district's nutrition education program by considering nutritional quality when selecting any snacks which they may donate for occasional class parties. Class parties or celebrations shall be held after the lunch period when possible.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 7 CFR 210.31 and Education Code 49431.9, as added by AB 841 (Ch. 843, Statutes of 2017), only those foods and beverages that are allowed for sale on campus during the school day may be marketed within the district. This prohibition includes the advertising during the school day on any property or facility owned or leased by the school district or school and used for school-related activities, including, but not limited to, school buildings, athletic fields, facilities, signs, scoreboards, or parking lots, or any school buses or other vehicles, equipment, vending machines, uniforms, educational material, or supplies. Also see BP 1325 - Advertising and Promotion.
To reinforce the district's nutrition education program, the Board prohibits the marketing and advertising of foods and beverages that do not meet nutrition standards for the sale of foods and beverages on campus during the school day.  (Education Code 49431.9; 7 CFR 210.31)

Program Implementation and Evaluation

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 1758b and 7 CFR 210.31 require the district to identify an individual with the authority and responsibility to ensure that each district school complies with the wellness policy. The Analysis of Comments to the federal regulations, 81 Fed. Reg. 50151 pg. 50155, recommends that districts provide a means of contacting the designated individual by providing a district or school phone number and/or email address.
The Superintendent designates the individual(s) identified below as the individual(s) responsible for ensuring that each school site complies with the district's wellness policy.  (42 USC 1758b; 7 CFR 210.31)

________________________________________
(Title or Position)

(Email Address)

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 1758b and 7 CFR 210.31 require an assessment of the implementation and compliance of the wellness policy, as specified in the paragraph below. At its discretion, the district may revise the following paragraph to reflect a more frequent schedule.
The Superintendent or designee shall assess the implementation and effectiveness of this policy at least once every three years.  (42 USC 1758b; 7 CFR 210.31)

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 1758b requires that the district assessment include a comparison of the district's policy with model wellness policies. See the USDA's web site for model policies and best practices recommended by federal and state agencies and nongovernmental organizations.
The assessment shall include the extent to which district schools are in compliance with this policy, the extent to which this policy compares to model wellness policies available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and a description of the progress made in attaining the goals of the wellness policy.  (42 USC 1758b)

The Superintendent or designee shall invite feedback on district and school wellness activities from food service personnel, school administrators, the wellness council, parents/guardians, students, teachers, before- and after-school program staff, and/or other appropriate persons.

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-9 below are optional and may be revised to reflect district practice. For further information about the following indicators and a list of other possible indicators, see CSBA's Monitoring for Success: A Guide for Assessing and Strengthening Student Wellness Policies. The guide also describes possible data sources that may be used for each indicator and includes a sample report format. Indicators selected by the district may include a mix of process measures (e.g., level of student participation, number of classes, staffing, and costs) as well as outcome measures that assess the policy's impact on students (e.g., physical fitness test results, Body Mass Index, and food choices).
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall establish indicators that will be used to measure the implementation and effectiveness of the district activities related to student wellness.  Such indicators may include, but are not limited to:

	Descriptions of the district's nutrition education, physical education, and health education curricula and the extent to which they align with state academic content standards and legal requirements
	 
	An analysis of the nutritional content of school meals and snacks served in all district programs, based on a sample of menus and production records
	 
	Student participation rates in all school meal and/or snack programs, including the number of students enrolled in the free and reduced-price meals program compared to the number of students eligible for that program
	 
	Extent to which foods and beverages sold on campus outside the food services program, such as through vending machines, student stores, or fundraisers, comply with nutrition standards
	 
	Extent to which other foods and beverages that are available on campus during the school day, such as foods and beverages for classroom parties, school celebrations, and rewards/incentives, comply with nutrition standards
	 
	Results of the state's physical fitness test at applicable grade levels
	 
	Number of minutes of physical education offered at each grade span, and the estimated percentage of class time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity
	 
	A description of district efforts to provide additional opportunities for physical activity outside of the physical education program
	 
	A description of other districtwide or school-based wellness activities offered, including the number of sites and/or students participating, as appropriate

As feasible, the assessment report may include a comparison of results across multiple years, a comparison of district data with county, statewide, or national data, and/or a comparison of wellness data with other student outcomes such as academic indicators or student discipline rates.

CSBA NOTE: In addition to the district self-assessment described above, 7 CFR 210. 18, as amended by 81 Fed. Reg. 50151, requires that the CDE conduct administrative reviews of all districts at least once every three years to ensure that districts are complying with their wellness policy. See section "Records" below for information about records that may be required for this assessment. The USDA's Food and Nutrition Service may grant a one-year extension to the CDE's three-year review cycle if needed for efficient state management of the program.
In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall prepare and maintain the proper documentation and records needed for the administrative review of the district's wellness policy conducted by the California Department of Education (CDE) every three years.

The assessment results of both the district and state evaluations shall be submitted to the Board for the purposes of evaluating policy and practice, recognizing accomplishments, and making policy adjustments as needed to focus district resources and efforts on actions that are most likely to make a positive impact on student health and achievement.

Notifications

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49432, 42 USC 1758b, and 7 CFR 210.31, the district is required to inform the public of the content and implementation of the wellness policy and the district's progress towards meeting the goals of the policy, as described below.
The Superintendent or designee shall inform the public about the content and implementation of the district's wellness policy and shall make the policy, and any updates to the policy, available the public on an annual basis. He/she shall also inform the public of the district's progress towards meeting the goals of the wellness policy, including the availability of the triennial district assessment.  (Education Code 49432; 42 USC 1758b; 7 CFR 210.31)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall distribute this information through the most effective methods of communication, including district or school newsletters, handouts, parent/guardian meetings, district and school web sites, and other communications. Outreach to parents/guardians shall emphasize the relationship between student health and wellness and academic performance.

CSBA NOTE: As amended by SB 1169 (Ch. 280, Statutes of 2016), Education Code 49432 no longer requires schools to post the district's policies and regulations on nutrition and physical activity in public view within all school cafeterias or other central eating areas. Education Code 49432 continues to authorize, but does not require, schools to post a summary of nutrition and physical activity laws and regulations. The following paragraph is optional.
Each school may post a summary of nutrition and physical activity laws and regulations prepared by the CDE.

Records

CSBA NOTE: 7 CFR 210.31, as added by 81 Fed. Reg. 50151, requires the district to retain records to document compliance with the federal regulation. The following paragraph outlines the records that, at a minimum, must be retained by the district.
The Superintendent or designee shall retain records that document compliance with 7 CFR 210.31, including, but not limited to, the written student wellness policy, documentation of the triennial assessment of the wellness policy for each school site, and documentation demonstrating compliance with the community involvement requirements, including requirements to make the policy and assessment results available to the public.  (7 CFR 210.31)

<strong><span style="text-autospace:none">School Wellness Council</span></strong><br>
<br>
