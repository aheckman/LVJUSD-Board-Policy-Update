## Policy Content

The Board of Education encourages the use of supplementary instructional materials to enrich the curriculum and enhance student learning. Such materials shall be aligned with District goals, curriculum objectives, and academic standards and shall supplement and not supplant the use of Board-adopted basic instructional materials that serve as the primary learning resources.

Supplementary instructional materials include, but are not limited to, instructional materials that are designed to serve one or more of the following purposes:  (Education Code 60010)

	To provide more complete coverage of one or more subjects included in a given course
	 
	To meet the various learning ability levels of students in a given age group or grade level
	 
	To meet the diverse educational needs of students with a language disability in a given age group or grade level
	 
	To meet the diverse educational needs of students reflective of a condition of cultural pluralism
	 
	To use current, relevant technology that further engages interactive learning in the classroom and beyond

Supplementary instructional materials may be selected by the Superintendent or designee, school administrators, or teachers, as applicable, and obtained through donations to the District and/or available funding sources designated for these purposes.

The use of any supplemental instructional material shall not be rejected or prohibited by the Board or District on the basis that it includes a study of the role and contributions of any individual or group consistent with the requirements of Education Code 51204.5 and 60040, unless such study would violate Education Code 51501 or 60044.  (Education Code 243)

As appropriate, supplementary instructional materials shall meet the criteria developed for the selection and evaluation of basic instructional materials as described in AR 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials.

Supplementary instructional materials shall be directly related to the course of study in which they are being used and shall be appropriate for the age and maturity level of the students.

The use or reproduction of supplementary instructional materials shall be in accordance with federal copyright law.

Appropriateness of Materials

Whenever a District employee proposes to use a supplementary resource which is not included in the approved learning resources of the District, the employee shall preview the material to determine whether, in the employee's professional judgment, it is appropriate for the grade level taught and is consistent with District criteria for the selection of supplementary instructional materials.

The employee shall confer with the Superintendent or designee as necessary to determine the compliance of the material with District criteria. The primary considerations should be the educational value, factual accuracy, appropriateness, including whether the material contains pervasive vulgarity or profanity, and relevance of the materials, as well as the ages and maturity of the students.

The Superintendent or designee may provide training to administrators and teachers in the selection and evaluation of supplementary instructional materials, including the criteria to be utilized and applicable legal considerations.
Films

When a teacher desires to show a film that has not been approved by the District or county for use in the grade level taught, the teacher shall preview the film to determine whether in his/her professional judgment it is consistent with District criteria for the selection of instructional materials.

If the teacher has any questions about how established District criteria apply to the film, he/she shall confer with the principal or designee before showing the film.
Complaints

Complaints concerning supplemental instructional materials shall be handled in accordance with Board Policy 1312.2 - Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials and Board Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, as applicable.
