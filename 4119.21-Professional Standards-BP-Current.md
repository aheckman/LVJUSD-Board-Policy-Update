## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy should be revised to reflect district practice and/or any related provisions of collective bargaining agreements.
The Governing Board expects district employees to maintain the highest ethical standards, behave professionally, follow district policies and regulations, abide by state and federal laws, and exercise good judgment when interacting with students and other members of the school community. Employees shall engage in conduct that enhances the integrity of the district, advances the goals of the district's educational programs, and contributes to a positive school climate.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph encourages district employees to abide by standards developed by their professional associations. These standards are reproduced at E 4119.21 (certificated personnel), E 4219.21 (classified personnel), and E 4319.21 (administrative and supervisory personnel).
The Board encourages district employees to accept as guiding principles the professional standards and codes of ethics adopted by educational or professional associations to which they may belong.

Each employee is expected to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to fulfill his/her responsibilities and to contribute to the learning and achievement of district students.

Inappropriate Conduct

Inappropriate employee conduct includes, but is not limited to:

	Engaging in any conduct that endangers students, staff, or others, including, but not limited to, physical violence, threats of violence, or possession of a firearm or other weapon
	 
	Engaging in harassing or discriminatory behavior towards students, parents/guardians, staff, or community members, or failing or refusing to intervene when an act of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying against a student is observed
	 
	Physically abusing, sexually abusing, neglecting, or otherwise willfully harming or injuring a child

	Possessing or viewing any pornography on school grounds, or possessing or viewing child pornography or other imagery portraying children in a sexualized manner at any time
	 
	Using profane, obscene, or abusive language against students, parents/guardians, staff, or community members
	 
	Willfully disrupting district or school operations by loud or unreasonable noise or other action
	 
	Using tobacco, alcohol, or an illegal or unauthorized substance, or possessing or distributing any controlled substance, while in the workplace, on district property, or at a school-sponsored activity
	 
	Being dishonest with students, parents/guardians, staff, or members of the public, including, but not limited to, falsifying information in employment records or other school records

Reports of Misconduct

An employee who observes or has evidence of another employee's inappropriate conduct shall immediately report such conduct to the principal or Superintendent or designee. An employee who has knowledge of or suspects child abuse or neglect shall file a report pursuant to the district's child abuse reporting procedures as detailed in AR 5141.4 - Child Abuse Prevention and Reporting.

CSBA NOTE: Discipline of employees is a subject of collective bargaining. For information about the range of disciplinary actions that may be taken, see BP/AR 4118 - Dismissal/Suspension/Disciplinary Action, and AR 4218 - Dismissal/Suspension/Disciplinary Action. Education Code 44242.5 and 5 CCR 80303 require the Superintendent to notify the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) when the status of a certificated employee changes as a result of alleged misconduct.  Although "alleged misconduct" is not defined in the law, the CTC states that conduct affecting classroom safety, student safety, or the integrity of the school environment is the type of misconduct that must be reported.  See AR 4117.7/4317.7 - Employment Status Reports.
Any reports of employee misconduct shall be promptly investigated. Any employee who is found to have engaged in inappropriate conduct in violation of law or Board policy shall be subject to disciplinary action and, in the case of a certificated employee, may be subject to a report to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. The Superintendent or designee shall notify local law enforcement as appropriate.

An employee who has knowledge of but fails to report inappropriate employee conduct may also be subject to discipline.

The district prohibits retaliation against anyone who files a complaint against an employee or reports an employee's inappropriate conduct.  Any employee who retaliates against any such complainant, reporter, or other participant in the district's complaint process shall be subject to discipline.

Notifications

CSBA NOTE: Beginning January 1, 2018, Education Code 44050, as added by AB 500 (Ch. 580, Statutes of 2017), requires districts maintaining an employee code of conduct that addresses employee interactions with students to post the section(s) on employee-student interactions in a publicly accessible manner on each school's web site, or the district web site if a school does not maintain one.
