## Policy Content

The Governing Board desires to promote effective communication from the district and/or school to families to keep families informed regarding educational programs, school operations, and the legal rights of students and parents/guardians. The Superintendent or designee shall send parents/guardians all notifications required by law and any other notifications the Superintendent or designee believes will promote familial understanding and involvement.

Notice of the rights and responsibilities of parents/guardians as specified in Education Code 48980 shall be sent at the beginning of each academic year and may be provided by regular mail, in electronic form when so requested by the parent/guardian, or by any other method normally used by the district for written communication with parents/guardians.  (Education Code 48981)

No activity specified in Education Code 48980 shall be undertaken with respect to any particular student unless the student's parent/guardian has been informed of such action through the annual notification or other separate special notification. Such notice shall state the activity that will be undertaken and the approximate date on which the activity will occur.  (Education Code 48983-48984)

The annual notification shall include a request that the parent/guardian sign the notice and return it to the school or, if the notice is provided in electronic format, that the parent/guardian submit a signed acknowledgment of receipt of the notice to the school. The parent/guardian's signature is not required. Any signature is an acknowledgment of receipt of the information but does not indicate that consent to participate in any particular program has been given or withheld.  (Education Code 48982)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
Whenever a student enrolls in a district school during the school year, the student's parents/guardians shall be given all required parental notifications at that time.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph applies to notices required for certain federal programs, including, but not necessarily limited to, Title I notices pursuant to 20 USC 6311 and 6312, notices regarding the rights of parents/guardians of students with disabilities pursuant to 34 CFR 300.503 and 300.504, and notices of the educational rights of students experiencing homelessness pursuant to 42 USC 11432. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
Notifications shall be presented in an understandable and uniform format.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to state and federal antidiscrimination laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 USC 12101; 28 CFR 35) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 794), auxiliary aides and services must be provided to qualified individuals with disabilities to enable those individuals to effectively communicate and participate in public programs, services, or activities. For example, for the Medi-Cal Program, the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), the state agency that administers the program, has issued Policy and Procedure Letters No. 21-017R and No. 23-004, which require districts to develop a plan to meet these alternative format requirements. For more information on the Medi-Cal Program, see AR 5141.6 - School Health Services.
When necessary, the district shall provide notifications to qualified individuals with disabilities in alternative formats, such as braille, large font, or audio recordings, to enable such individuals to effectively participate in any program, service, or activity, as required by law.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48985, when 15 percent or more of students enrolled in a school speak a single primary language other than English, all notices and reports sent to the parents/guardians of these students must also be written in the primary language and may be answered by the parent/guardian in either language. Education Code 48985 requires the California Department of Education (CDE) to notify districts, by August 1 of each year, of the schools and the languages for which the translation of notices is required based on census data submitted to the CDE in the preceding fiscal year.
Whenever 15 percent or more of the students enrolled in a district school speak a single primary language other than English, as determined from the California Department of Education census data collected pursuant to Education Code 52164, all notices sent to the parent/guardian of any such student shall, in addition to being written in English, be written in the primary language, and may be responded to either in English or the primary language.  (Education Code 48981, 48985)

Whenever an employee learns that a student's parent/guardian is unable to understand the district's printed notifications for any reason, the employee shall inform the principal or designee, who shall work with the parent/guardian to establish other appropriate means of communication.
