Public Disclosure of Proposed Agreement

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 3547.5 requires that the Board, prior to entering into a written agreement, disclose the major provisions of the proposal; see the accompanying Board policy. The California Department of Education (CDE), in Management Advisory 92-01, recommends that the disclosure include, at a minimum, the following information and encourages districts to expand this information to address issues unique to their situation.
The Superintendent or designee shall prepare a summary of the proposed agreement which shall include, but may not necessarily be limited to:

	Major provisions of the agreement that affect compensation, such as:
	 
	
		Direct increases in salaries and percentage change in on-schedule salaries
		 
		Changes in health and welfare benefits
		 
		Changes in health and welfare benefit dollar contributions by the district
		 
		Changes in step and column or longevity provisions
		 
		Changes in overtime, differential, callback, and standby pay provisions
		 
		Changes in staffing ratios
		 
		One-time bonuses or off-the-schedule increases
		 
	
	
	Other provisions that will result in increased costs to the district even if they do not involve an increase in employee compensation, such as class-size reduction or increased number of staff development days
	 
	Costs of the proposed agreement, for the current and subsequent fiscal years, categorized for salaries, benefits, other compensation, and other noncompensation costs, including percentage increase of total compensation (salaries, benefits, and other compensation provisions) for the average represented employee as a result of the agreement and the approximate cost to the district of providing a one percent increase in total compensation
	 
	Proposed source(s) of funding for the current and subsequent fiscal years including the assumptions used to determine available resources to meet the obligations of the proposed agreement
	 
	Other major provisions that do not directly affect the district's costs, such as binding arbitration or grievance procedures
