## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes the environmental and financial benefits that can be derived from conserving energy, water, and other natural resources, preparing for extreme weather and other natural events, and providing an environment that promotes the health and well-being of students and staff. To support district goals for energy and water management, the Superintendent or designee shall develop a resource management program which may include strategies for implementing effective and sustainable resource use practices, exploring the use of renewable and clean energy technology and/or sources, reducing energy and water consumption, and promoting conservation principles in the educational program.

The Superintendent or designee may solicit input from staff, students, and parents/guardians regarding the district's resource management program. The Superintendent or designee shall provide staff and students with training and guidance on best practices to achieve the district's goals, and may establish a reward program to recognize outstanding accomplishments.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly inspect district facilities, monitor operations, and make recommendations for maintenance and repairs which may help the district reach its conservation and management goals and improve efficiency.

CSBA NOTE: The California Energy Commission administers the Bright Schools Program pursuant to Public Resources Code 25410-25421. This program offers specific services to help districts become more energy efficient by providing design and implementation assistance, conducting energy audit and feasibility studies, providing equipment bid specifications, assisting with installation, and helping to secure loans for energy-related maintenance. Districts may also seek funding for water projects through the Department of Water Resource's Proposition 1 Integrated Regional Water Management Grant Program, which provides funding for projects that help meet the long-term water needs of the state.
The Superintendent or designee shall make every effort to identify funding opportunities and cost-reducing incentive programs to help the district achieve its conservation and management goals. The district may coordinate with other local or regional entities to capitalize on their expertise and maximize the efficient use of resources, such as through joint or shared use agreements.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board on the district's progress in meeting its conservation and resource management goals.

Storm Water Management

CSBA NOTE:  The following section is recommended for use by all districts, especially districts that are subject to the state's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Industrial Activities or that have been designated by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) or a California regional water quality control board as an entity ("non-traditional MS4") which is required to obtain "coverage" under a General Permit for Storm Water Discharges to Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems.A district may be subject to either permit for a variety of reasons, including conducting activities that may result in discharge of water from any district facility which drains into a municipal storm drainage system or drains directly or indirectly into a stream, creek, river, or the ocean. A district that is covered by either or both of these General Permits must develop a storm water management plan consistent with the requirements of state and federal law and the applicable permit. The General Permit requires that the Governing Board adopt a resolution containing the plan and authorizing the Superintendent to implement and enforce the plan. The plan must then be submitted to the local regional water quality control board for approval. In addition, the district is required to submit annual reports to the local regional water control board describing the district's progress in implementing the plan.The following section and the accompanying administrative regulation reflect the recommendations of the California Department of Education (CDE), the Division of the State Architect in the Department of General Services, and the SWRCB in their joint publication Guidance for Stormwater and Dry Weather Runoff CAPTURE (California Practices to Use Runoff Effectively) at Schools, developed pursuant to Water Code 189.3, as amended by SB 1289 (Ch. 92, Statutes of 2018). See the Guidance for additional design and use practices for storm water and dry weather runoff capture practices that can generally be applied to all new, reconstructed, or altered public schools, including school grounds.
To the maximum extent practicable, the district shall reduce the discharge of pollutants into the water system in order to minimize the threat to water quality from storm water runoff.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district complies with storm water discharge standards specified by any applicable General Permit coverage required by law, including all requirements of the Construction General Permit issued by the State Water Resources Control Board for any project that disturbs one acre or more of soil.  (40 CFR 122.34).

CSBA NOTE: The NPDES and MS4 General Permits each contain their own requirements. Districts should consult with their local regional water quality control board for requirements and approval of the plan.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a storm water management plan that complies with the provisions of the applicable permit and describes best management practices, design strategies, measurable goals, and timetables for implementation. The plan and a resolution authorizing its implementation shall be submitted to the Board for approval.  (40 CFR 122.34)

For all projects, the district shall comply with any city or county ordinance that regulates drainage improvements and conditions.  (Government Code 53097)

Emergency Interruption of Services

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section requires the development of an emergency action plan which identifies actions to be taken in the event of a toxic spill or emergency interruption of power, water, or other services. However, schools that are affected by regular public safety power shutoffs (e.g., actions by utility companies to preemptively shut off power in high fire risk areas to reduce fire risk during extreme and potentially dangerous weather conditions) should also consider including this section. This plan may be incorporated into the district's emergency and disaster preparedness plan. See BP/AR 3516 - Emergencies and Disaster Preparedness Plan.In the event that instructional time is lost as a result of a power outage resulting from an emergency, such as a fire, flood, earthquake, epidemic, or other hardship as specified in Education Code 46392, districts may request credit for the loss of average daily attendance funding, as detailed in the CDE's Management Advisory 90-01. See BP 3516.5 - Emergency Schedules for policy regarding changes in schedules due to an emergency and procedures for compensating for lost instructional time.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a plan to minimize disruption to the educational program in the event of power outages or other emergency interruption of utility services. The plan shall include actions to be taken to facilitate student and staff safety, administrative control of operations, protection of equipment, effective communications, and coordination with local fire, police, and emergency personnel and utility service providers.
