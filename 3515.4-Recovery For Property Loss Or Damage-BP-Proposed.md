## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to create a safe and secure learning environment and to minimize acts of vandalism and damage to school property. When District property is damaged due to the willful misconduct of a student or other person, the District shall seek reimbursement of damages, within the limitations specified in law, from the parent/guardian of a minor child or from any other responsible individual.

The District may collect debt owed by a student or former student as a result of vandalism or to cover the replacement cost of District books, supplies, or property loaned to a student that the student willfully fails to return or that is willfully cut, defaced, or otherwise injured. However, this policy shall not apply to a student who is a current or former homeless or foster child or youth.  (Education Code 48904, 49014)

Rewards

The Board may offer and pay a reward for information leading to the determination of the identity of, and the apprehension of, any person who willfully damages or destroys any District property.  (Government Code 53069.5)

The Board authorizes the Superintendent or designee to offer a reward in any amount deemed appropriate, not exceeding $500. A reward in excess of $500 shall be authorized in advance by the Board.

The Superintendent or designee shall disburse the reward when the guilt of the person responsible for the act has been established by a criminal conviction or other appropriate judicial procedure. If more than one person provides information, the reward shall be divided among them as appropriate.
