## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that elect to use an alternative procedure for awarding contracts for public works projects pursuant to the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (UPCCAA) (Public Contract Code 22000-22045), which establishes a higher bid limit and a more informal bidding process for certain projects. See BP/AR 3311 - Bids for traditional bidding procedures pursuant to Public Contract Code 20110-20118.4.Pursuant to Public Contract Code 22032, as amended by AB 2192 (Ch. 953, Statutes of 2024), projects of $75,000 or less may be performed by the district's own work force, projects of $220,000 or less may be contracted using a more informal bidding procedure as specified, and projects over $220,000 are required to be let to contract by formal bidding procedures. See the accompanying administrative regulation for related requirements.In order to participate in UPCCAA, Public Contract Code 22030 requires the Governing Board to adopt a resolution electing to use UPCCAA for district contracting and to notify the State Controller of that action. In the event of a conflict with any other provision of law relative to bidding procedures, UPCCAA applies for any district that has adopted a resolution and so notified the Controller. According to the California Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Commission's, "Frequently Asked Questions," available on its website, once the Board has adopted such a resolution, it can only withdraw from UPCCAA by adopting a resolution of the election to withdraw and filing that resolution with the State Controller.
In awarding contracts for public works projects involving district facilities, the Governing Board desires to obtain the best value to the district and ensure the qualifications of contractors to complete the project in a satisfactory manner. The Board has, by resolution, adopted the procedures set forth in the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (UPCCAA) pursuant to Public Contract Code 22030-22045, including the informal bidding procedures when allowed by law.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. In circumstances where the informal bidding procedure is authorized, Public Contract Code 22034 allows the Board to delegate the authority to award contracts to an appropriate district administrator. Additionally, Public Contract Code 22039 authorizes the Board to delegate the authority to adopt plans, specifications, and working details for projects subject to formal bidding procedures.
The Board delegates to the Superintendent or designee the responsibilities to award any contract eligible for informal bidding procedures and to develop plans, specifications, and working details for all public projects requiring formal bidding procedures.

No work, project, service, or purchase shall be split or separated into smaller work orders or projects for the purpose of evading legal requirements for competitive bidding.  (Public Contract Code 22033)

If after the first invitation of bids pursuant to informal or formal bidding procedures under UPCCAA all bids are rejected, the Board may, by passage of a resolution by four-fifths vote, declare the project can be performed more economically by the employees of the district.  (Public Contract Code 22038)

CSBA NOTE: In electing to be subject to UPCCAA, the district agrees to follow the cost accounting procedures set forth in the, "Cost Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual of the California Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Commission," pursuant to Public Contract Code 22017 and 22019. According to the Commission's, "Frequently Asked Questions," available on its website, districts may use the statewide Standardized Account Code Structure to comply with tracking requirements.
Projects awarded through UPCCAA shall be subject to the cost accounting procedures established by the California Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Commission.  (Public Contract Code 22030)

Emergency Actions

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Public Contract Code 22035, a district may, in accordance with Public Contract Code 22050, replace or repair a school facility without going through the UPCCAA process in cases of emergency. Public Contract Code 1102 defines "emergency" as a "sudden, unexpected occurrence that poses a clear and imminent danger, requiring immediate action to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of life, health, property, or essential public services."
When formal bids are required by law, but an emergency necessitates immediate repair or replacements, the Board may, upon a four-fifths vote of the Board, proceed to replace or repair a facility without adopting plans, specifications, strain sheets, or working details, or giving notice for bids to let contracts. The work may be done by day labor under the direction of the Board and/or contractor. The emergency action shall subsequently be reviewed by the Board in accordance with Public Contract Code 22050 and shall be terminated at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant, so that the remainder of the emergency action may be completed by giving notice for bids to let contracts.  (Public Contract Code 1102, 22035, 22050)
