The Superintendent or designee shall establish and maintain a program of guidance, placement, and follow-up for all high school students subject to compulsory continuation education.  (Education Code 48431)

To enhance the educational counseling program and assist students in reaching their educational and professional goals, the District shall provide students in grades 9-12 with financial aid support; social services support; state-funded immigration legal services; academic opportunities; and parent/guardian and family workshops.  (Education Code 54680, 54683)

No counselor shall unlawfully discriminate against any student. Guidance counseling regarding school programs and career, vocational, or higher education opportunities shall not be differentiated on the basis of any protected category specified in law or Board Policy 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities.

Additionally, counselors shall affirmatively explore with a student the possibility of careers, or courses leading to careers, that are nontraditional for that student's sex.  (Education Code 221.5)

For assessing or counseling students, the District shall not use testing or other materials that permit or require impermissible or unlawful differential treatment of students, unless such different materials cover the same occupations and interest areas and the use of such materials is essential to the elimination of bias and discrimination.  (5 CCR 4931)

Colleges and prospective employers, including military recruiters, shall have the same access to students for recruiting purposes.  (Education Code 49603; 10 USC 503; 20 USC 7908)

Additionally, the District shall provide the notification to any community college district that has overlapping jurisdiction with the District and an opportunity for the community college district to participate in the college or career fair.  (Education Code 52770)

Personal or Mental Health Counseling

A school counselor, school psychologist, or school social worker may provide individualized personal, mental health, or family counseling to students in accordance with the specialization(s) authorized by their credential. Such services may include, but are not limited to, support related to the student's social and emotional development, behavior, substance abuse, mental health assessment, depression, or mental illness. As appropriate, students and their parents/guardians shall be informed about community agencies, organizations, or health care providers that offer qualified professional assistance.

Written parent/guardian consent shall be obtained before mental health counseling or treatment services are provided to a student, except when the student is authorized to consent to the service pursuant to Family Code 6924, Health and Safety Code 124260, or other applicable law.

Any information of a personal nature disclosed to a school counselor by a student age 12 years or older or by the student's parent/guardian is confidential and shall not become part of the student record without the written consent of the person who disclosed the confidential information. The information shall not be revealed, released, discussed, or referred to except under the limited circumstances specified in Education Code 49602.  (Education Code 49602)

A counselor shall consult with the Superintendent or designee and, as appropriate, with the District's legal counsel whenever there is uncertainty regarding how to respond to a student's personal problem or when questions arise regarding the possible release of confidential information regarding a student.

Crisis Counseling

The Board recognizes the need for a prompt and effective response when students are confronted with a traumatic incident. School counselors shall assist in the development of the emergency and disaster preparedness plan and other prevention and intervention practices designed to assist students and parents/guardians before, during, and after a crisis.

Early identification and intervention plans shall be developed to help identify those students who may be at risk for violence so that support may be provided before they engage in violent or disruptive behavior.

Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall identify crisis counseling resources to train District staff in effective threat assessment, appropriate response techniques, and/or methods to directly help students cope with a crisis if it occurs.

Teacher-Based Advisory Program

The Board recognizes that a supportive, ongoing relationship with a caring adult can provide a student with valuable advice, enhance student-teacher relationships, and build the student's feelings of connectedness with the school. The Board authorizes the development of a teacher-based advisory program in which teachers advise students in such areas as academic planning, character development, conflict resolution, and self-esteem. Any teacher participating in this program shall be under the supervision of a credentialed school counselor as appropriate, receive related information and training, and be subject to law and this Board policy, including requirements pertaining to student confidentiality and nondiscrimination.
