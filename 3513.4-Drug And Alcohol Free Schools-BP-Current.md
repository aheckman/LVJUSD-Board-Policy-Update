## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy prohibits the possession, use, or sale of drugs or alcohol by any person on district property. For policy addressing the prevention and intervention of alcohol and drug use among students, see BP 5131.6 - Alcohol and Other Drugs. For policy prohibiting employees from possessing, using, or being under the influence of a controlled substance in the workplace, see BP 4020 - Drug and Alcohol Free Workplace.
The Governing Board recognizes the need to keep district schools free of drugs and alcohol in order to create a safe and healthy environment conducive to learning and promote student health and well-being. The Board prohibits the possession, use, or sale of drugs and alcohol at any time in district-owned or leased buildings, on district property, and in district vehicles, unless otherwise permitted by law.

The following substances are prohibited on all district property:

	Any substance which may not lawfully be possessed, used, or sold in California
	
	CSBA NOTE: Although Health and Safety Code 11362.1, as amended by Proposition 64 (2016), authorizes persons age 21 years and older to possess and use specified amounts of cannabis, Health and Safety Code 11362.3 prohibits possession or use of cannabis by persons under age 21 and prohibits all persons from possessing, smoking, or ingesting cannabis or cannabis products on the grounds of a school, day care center, or youth center while children are present.
	Cannabis or cannabis products  (Health and Safety Code 11362.3; 21 USC 812, 844)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Business and Professions Code 25608, it is a misdemeanor to possess, consume, sell, give, or deliver any alcoholic beverage to any person in a school building or on school grounds unless a specified exception applies. Such exceptions include, but are not limited to, alcohol served during a special event, pursuant to a license or permit obtained under the Alcohol Beverage Control Act, at district-owned facilities at a time when students are not present. Districts that do not allow any of the specified exceptions should revise item #3 accordingly. See AR 1330 - Use of School Facilities.
	Alcoholic beverages, unless approved by the Superintendent or designee for limited purposes specified in Business and Professions Code 25608

CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to various state laws, prescribed medication may be administered at school with written statements from the student's parent/guardian and authorized health care provider; see BP/AR 5141.21 - Administering Medication and Monitoring Health Conditions. However, Health and Safety Code 11362.79 prohibits a person who has been authorized for medical use of cannabis from smoking cannabis on the grounds of or within 1,000 feet of a school, recreation center, or youth center or on a school bus, and Health and Safety Code 11362.3 prohibits cannabis on district property while children are present as noted in item #2 above. In addition, federal law (21 USC 812, 844) continues to prohibit the possession of cannabis, even by medical users.
Prescription medication, except for prescribed cannabis, may be administered at school in accordance with law, district policy and regulations, and written statements by the parent/guardian and the student's authorized health care provider as applicable.

Information about the district's drug- and alcohol-free schools policy and the consequences for violations shall be communicated clearly to employees, parents/guardians, students, and the community.

Enforcement/Discipline

The Superintendent or designee shall take appropriate action to eliminate the possession, use, or sale of alcohol and other drugs and related paraphernalia in district facilities, on district property, in district vehicles, or at school-sponsored activities. As appropriate, he/she may direct anyone violating this policy to leave school property and/or refer the matter to law enforcement.

Students and employees who violate the terms of this policy may be subject to discipline and/or referred to assistance programs in accordance with law and Board policy.
