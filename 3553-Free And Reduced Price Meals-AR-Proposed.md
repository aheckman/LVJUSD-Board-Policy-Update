If the review indicates that the initial eligibility determination is correct, the Superintendent or designee shall verify the approved household application. If the review indicates that the initial eligibility determination is incorrect, the Superintendent or designee shall:  (42 USC 1758; 7 CFR 245.6a)

	If the eligibility status changes from reduced price to free, make the increased benefits immediately available and notify the household of the change in benefits

	If the eligibility status changes from free or reduced price to paid, send the household a notice of adverse action as described below

If, as a result of verification activities, the eligibility of a household that is receiving free or reduced-price benefits cannot be confirmed, or if the household fails to cooperate with verification efforts, the Superintendent or designee shall reduce or terminate benefits, as applicable, and shall properly document and retain on file in the District the reasons for the household's ineligibility. At least 10 days prior to the actual reduction or termination, the Superintendent or designee shall send a notice of adverse action to the household. The notice shall advise the household of:  (7 CFR 245.6a)


	The change and the reasons for the change
