## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of directory information and therefore authorizes the release of such information only in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.

The Superintendent or designee may release student directory information to representatives of the news media or nonprofit organizations in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation.

The Superintendent or designee may limit or deny the release of specific categories of directory information to any public or private nonprofit organization based on his/her determination of the best interests of district students.  (Education Code 49073)

CSBA NOTE: The options below are for use only by districts maintaining grades 9-12.20 USC 7908 requires districts receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to provide military recruiters with access to student names, addresses and telephone numbers, except when the parent/guardian requests that the information not be released. See the accompanying administrative regulation. According to Guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Defense, even if a district does not disclose directory information to any third party, such as employers or colleges, 20 USC 7908 provides that military recruiters must still be provided access to student names, addresses, and telephone numbers, except when the parent/guardian requests that the information not be released. Districts that do not grant access may lose their ESEA funds.10 USC 503 requires districts that do not receive ESEA funds to grant the same access to directory information to military recruiters and employers. Pursuant to 10 USC 503, districts may refuse military access only if the Governing Board has adopted a policy denying access by the military. Districts that do not grant access and have not adopted a policy denying access may be subject to specific interventions such as notification of the Governor and Congress, so that public officials can work with the district. In addition, Education Code 49603 provides that military service recruiters may not be denied on-campus access to students in grades 9-12 if the district provides such access to other employers; see BP 6164.2 - Guidance/Counseling Services. It is likely that this law also applies to directory information.Option 1 is for use by districts that receive ESEA funds and grant access to directory information to employers, colleges, and military recruiters. Option 1 is also for use by districts that do not receive ESEA funds but choose to grant such access to employers and colleges and therefore are required to grant access to military recruiters. Option 2 is mandated for those districts that do not receive ESEA funds and wish to deny access to military recruiters. In order to deny access to military recruiters, Education Code 49603 requires that these districts must also deny access to all other employers.
OPTION 1: Colleges and prospective employers, including military recruiters, shall have access to directory information.  Military recruiters shall have access to a student's name, address, and telephone number, unless the parent/guardian has specified that the information not be released in accordance with law and administrative regulation.  (20 USC 7908; 10 USC 503; Education Code 49603)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2: Colleges and prospective employers, including military recruiters, shall not have access to directory information. (10 USC 503; Education Code 49603)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: Districts should carefully consider whether to place items containing student directory information, such as home addresses or telephone numbers, on the district's web site since release of such information may put students at risk and may also be a violation of Education Code 49073 as specified below.
Under no circumstances shall directory information be disclosed to a private profit-making entity, except for representatives of the news media and prospective employers, in accordance with Board policy.  Private schools and colleges may be given the names and addresses of 12th-grade students and students who are no longer enrolled provided that they use this information only for purposes directly related to the institution's academic or professional goals.  (Education Code 49073)
