CSBA NOTE: In instances where the rights of the parent/guardian have been limited, the court may appoint an educational representative on a temporary or long-term basis to make educational decisions for the student.
Person holding the right to make educational decisions means a responsible adult appointed by a court pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code 361 or 726.

School of origin means the school that the foster youth attended when permanently housed or the school in which the foster youth was last enrolled. If the school the foster youth attended when permanently housed is different from the school in which the foster youth was last enrolled, or if there is another school that the foster youth attended with which the foster youth is connected and that the foster youth attended within the preceding 15 months, the district liaison, in consultation with, and with the agreement of, the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth shall determine, in the best interests of the foster youth, the school that shall be deemed the school of origin.  (Education Code 48853.5)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48850 expresses the legislative intent that the "best interests" of a foster youth include educational stability as well as placement in the least restrictive educational setting necessary to achieve academic progress, as provided below.In addition, pursuant to 20 USC 6311, determination of a student's "best interest" requires consideration of all factors relating to the student's best interest, including the appropriateness of the current educational setting and the proximity to the school in which the student is enrolled at the time of placement.
Best interests of a foster youth means that, in making educational and school placement decisions for a foster youth, consideration is given to, among other factors, the proximity to the school at the time of placement, appropriateness of the educational setting, educational stability, the opportunity to be educated in the least restrictive educational setting necessary to achieve academic progress, and the foster youth's access to academic resources, services, and extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to all district students.  (Education Code 48850, 48853; 20 USC 6311)

District Liaison

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48853.5, districts are required to designate a staff person as the educational liaison for foster youth. The person may be the same individual designated as the liaison for homeless students as required by 42 USC 11432; see AR 6173 - Education for Homeless Children. In addition, Education Code 48853.5 requires that, for districts operating a foster youth services program, the liaison be affiliated with that program. The duties of the liaison are as specified below.
The Superintendent designates the following position as the district's liaison for foster youth:  (Education Code 48853.5)

As part of the program, such county offices must develop and implement a coordinating plan for purposes of establishing guiding principles and protocols to provide supports for foster care students. To the extent possible, such a plan must include, but is not limited to, a description of how the program will establish ongoing collaboration among local educational agencies, county child welfare agencies, and county probation departments to determine the proper educational placement of foster youth. In addition, pursuant to Education Code 42921, if a district annually certifies in writing that it is unable, using any other state, federal, local, or private funds, to provide tutoring, mentoring, and counseling for foster youth, it may enter into a temporary agreement with the foster youth services coordinating program to provide those services, if the program has established such services.

Enrollment

A student placed in a licensed children's institution or foster family home within the district shall attend programs operated by the district unless one of the following circumstances applies:  (Education Code 48853, 48853.5)

	The student has an individualized education program requiring placement in a nonpublic, nonsectarian school or agency or in another local educational agency
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48853, a district is required to educate foster youth in the least restrictive environment necessary for their educational achievement. However, a district may be discharged from this obligation when the parent/guardian or other person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth unilaterally decides to place the foster youth in another educational program and provides the district a written statement as specified in item #2 below.
	The parent/guardian or other person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student determines that it is in the best interests of the student to be placed in another education program and submits a written statement to the district indicating that determination and an awareness of the following:
	 
	
		The student has a right to attend a regular public school in the least restrictive environment
		 
		The alternate education program is a special education program, if applicable
		 
		The decision to unilaterally remove the student from the district school and to place the student in an alternate education program may not be financed by the district
		 
		Any attempt to seek reimbursement for the alternate education program may be at the expense of the parent/guardian or other person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student
		
		CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48853.5, the education of a foster youth may continue in the school of origin under the circumstances stated below. Elementary and high school districts should delete any Item (#3b or c) that is not applicable to the grade levels served by the district.
	
	
	At the initial placement or any subsequent change in placement, the student exercises the right to continue in the school of origin, as defined above. In any such circumstance, the following shall apply:
	 
	
		The student may continue in the school of origin for the duration of the court's jurisdiction
		 
		If the court's jurisdiction over a grade K-8 student is terminated prior to the end of a school year, the student may continue in the school of origin for the remainder of the school year
		 
		If the court's jurisdiction is terminated while the student is in high school, the student may continue in the school of origin through graduation
		 
		If the student is transitioning between school grade levels, the student shall be allowed to continue in the district in the same attendance area to provide the student the benefit of matriculating with the student's peers in accordance with the established feeder patterns of school in the district. A student who is transitioning to a middle school or high school shall be allowed to enroll in the school designated for matriculation in another school district.
	
	

The role of the liaison shall be advisory with respect to placement decisions and determination of the school of origin.  (Education Code 48853.5)

The district liaison may, in consultation with and with the agreement of the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth, recommend that the foster youth's right to attend the school of origin be waived and the foster youth be enrolled in any school that students living in the attendance area in which the foster youth resides are eligible to attend. All decisions shall be made in accordance with the foster youth's best interests.  (Education Code 48853.5)

Prior to making any recommendation to move a foster youth from the school of origin, the liaison shall provide the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the youth with a written explanation of the basis for the recommendation and how the recommendation serves the youth's best interests.  (Education Code 48853.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48853.5, a district is required to immediately enroll any foster youth transferring into the district even when the foster youth has outstanding fees, fines, textbooks, or other moneys due to the last school attended or the district has not received the foster youth's academic or medical records, as listed in Items #1-3 below. However, pursuant to Health and Safety Code 120341, if a district does not receive a foster youth's immunization records prior to enrollment, the district must take steps, after the foster youth is enrolled, to obtain the immunization records or ensure that the foster youth is properly immunized. See BP/AR 5141.31 - Immunizations.
If the liaison, in consultation with the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth, agrees that the best interests of the foster youth would be served by a transfer to a school other than the school of origin, the principal or designee of the new school shall immediately enroll the foster youth, regardless of whether the foster youth:  (Education Code 48853.5)

	Has outstanding fees, fines, textbooks, or other items or monies due to the school last attended
	 
	Does not have clothing normally required by the school, such as school uniforms
	 
	Is unable to produce records normally required for enrollment, such as previous academic records, proof of residency, and medical records, including, but not limited to, immunization records or other documentation

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48853 and 48853.5 specify that, if a dispute arises regarding school placement, then the district shall use an existing dispute resolution process available to any district student. The following paragraph should be modified to reflect district practice.
If the foster youth or a person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth disagrees with the liaison's enrollment recommendation, an appeal may be filed with the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall make a determination within 30 calendar days of receipt of the appeal. Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Superintendent's decision, the foster youth or the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth may appeal that decision to the Board. The Board shall consider the issue at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Board's decision shall be final.

If any dispute arises regarding the request of a foster youth to remain in the school of origin, the foster youth has the right to remain in the school of origin pending resolution of the dispute.  (Education Code 48853.5)

Transportation

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48853.5, a district may, but is not required to, provide transportation to enable a foster youth to attend a school or school district of origin, except when it is otherwise required by federal law or pursuant to the individualized education program of a student with a disability. In accordance with 20 USC 6312, districts are mandated to collaborate with the local child welfare agency to develop clear written procedures governing how transportation will be provided, arranged, and funded to enable foster youth to attend their school of origin, when it is in their best interest to do so. The local child welfare agency may reimburse the district for any additional costs of such transportation, or the district may agree to pay for or share the costs with the child welfare agency. The following section may be revised to reflect the procedures established in collaboration with the child welfare agency, or such procedures may be incorporated into a memorandum of understanding or other document.
The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with the local child welfare agency to determine how transportation will be provided, arranged, and funded in a cost-effective manner to enable a foster youth to remain in the school of origin, for the duration of the time spent in foster care, when it is in the foster youth's best interest to do so. Such transportation costs may be paid by either the child welfare agency or the district, or shared by both.  (20 USC 6312)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 39807.5, as amended by AB 181, districts that provide home-to-school transportation and other transportation as expressly provided by law, and charge fees for such transportation, are required to waive transportation fees for foster youth. See BP 3250 - Transportation Fees and AR 3260 - Fees and Charges.
Any fees that the district charges for home-to-school transportation and other transportation as expressly provided by law shall be waived for foster youth.  (Education Code 39807.5)

Effect of Absences on Grades

The grades of a student in foster care shall not be lowered for any absence from school that is due to either of the following circumstances:  (Education Code 49069.5)

	A decision by a court or placement agency to change the student's placement, in which case the  grades shall be calculated as of the date the student left school
	 
	A verified court appearance or related court-ordered activity

Transfer of Coursework and Credits

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts maintaining high schools. Education Code 51225.2, as amended by SB 532 (Ch. 918, Statutes of 2022), addresses the transferability of coursework and credits completed by foster youth, as provided below.Education Code 51225.2, as amended by SB 532, requires the transferring school to include in the foster youth's educational record a determination of days of enrollment and/or seat time and an official transcript with full and partial credits and grades earned, or any measure of full or partial coursework being satisfactorily completed.
When a foster youth transfers into a district school, the district will receive an official transcript from the transferring school or district which reflects full and partial credits and grades earned by the foster youth and includes:  (Education Code 51225.2)

	A determination of the days of enrollment and/or seat time, if applicable for all full and partial credits earned based on any measure of full or partial coursework being satisfactorily completed
	
	Partial coursework satisfactorily completed includes any portion of an individual course, even if the student did not complete the entire course
	 
	Separate listings for credits and grades earned at each school and local educational agency so it is clear where credits and grades were earned
	 
	A complete record of the student's seat time, including both period attendance and days of enrollment

The district shall transfer the credits and grades from the transferring school's transcript onto an official district transcript in the same manner as described in Item #2, above.  (Education Code 51225.2)

If the Principal or designee has knowledge that the transcript from the transferring school may not include certain credits or grades, the Principal or designee shall contact the prior school within two business days to request that the full or partial credits be issued, which shall then be issued and provided by the prior school within two business days of the request.  (Education Code 51225.2)

The district shall accept and issue full or partial credit for any coursework that the foster youth has satisfactorily completed while attending another public school, a juvenile court school, a charter school, a school in a country other than the United States, or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school or agency.  (Education Code 51225.2)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.2, districts are not authorized to require a foster youth who has completed an entire course to retake the course.
If the entire course was completed, the district shall not require the foster youth to retake the course.  (Education Code 51225.2)

If the entire course was not completed at the previous school, the foster youth shall be issued partial credit for the coursework completed and shall be required to take the uncompleted portion of the course. However, the district may require the foster youth to retake the portion of the course completed if, in consultation with the holder of educational rights for the foster youth, the district finds that the foster youth is reasonably able to complete the requirements in time to graduate from high school. Whenever partial credit is issued to a foster youth in any particular course, the foster youth shall be enrolled in the same or equivalent course, if applicable, to enable the completion of the entire course.  (Education Code 51225.2)

CSBA NOTE: Although Education Code 51225.2 requires districts to award partial credits to foster youth who transfer from school to school, there is no uniform system for calculating and awarding partial credits. To ensure consistency in the treatment of foster youth, the California Child Welfare Council (CCWC), in its, "Partial Credit Model Policy and Practice Recommendations," available on its web site, recommends the approach specified in the following optional paragraph, which may be revised to reflect district practice.
Partial credits shall be awarded on the basis of 0.5 credits for every seven class periods attended per subject. If the school is on a block schedule, each block schedule class period attended shall be equal to two regular class periods per subject. Partial credits and grades earned by a student shall be included on the student's official transcript within two business days of the district's notification of the student's transfer, as required under Education Code 49069.5.

In no event shall the district prevent a foster youth from taking or retaking a course to meet the eligibility requirements for admission to the California State University or the University of California.  (Education Code 51225.2)

Applicability of Graduation Requirements

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts maintaining high schools. Also see BP 6146.1 - High School Graduation Requirements.
To obtain a high school diploma, a foster youth shall complete all courses required by Education Code 51225.3 and fulfill any additional graduation requirements prescribed by the Board.

However, when a foster youth who has completed the second year of high school transfers into the district from another school district or transfers between high schools within the district, the foster youth shall be exempted from all district-established coursework and other district-established graduation requirements, unless the district makes a finding that the student is reasonably able to complete the additional requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the fourth year of high school. Within 30 calendar days of the foster youth's transfer, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the foster youth, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth, and the foster youth's social worker of the availability of the exemption and whether the foster youth qualifies for it. If the Superintendent or designee fails to provide this notification, the student shall be eligible for the exemption once notified, even if the notification occurs after the student is no longer a foster youth.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, to determine whether a foster youth with significant gaps in school attendance is in the third or fourth year of high school, the student's age as compared to the average age of students in the third or fourth year of high school may be used.
To determine whether a foster youth is in the third or fourth year of high school, the district shall use either the number of credits the foster youth has earned as of the date of the transfer, the length of school enrollment, or for a foster youth with significant gaps in school attendance, the foster youth's age as compared to the average age of students in the third or fourth year of high school, whichever qualifies the foster youth for the exemption.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, requires the district to exempt a foster youth who qualifies for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements, under the circumstances described below.
If a foster youth was not properly notified of an exemption, declined the exemption, or was not previously exempted, the foster youth or the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth may request the exemption and the Superintendent or designee shall exempt the foster youth within 30 days of the request.  A student who at one time qualified for the exemption may request the exemption even if the student is no longer eligible.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, the district is required to reevaluate a foster youth's eligibility for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements, as described below
When the Superintendent or designee determines that a foster youth who transferred into a district school is reasonably able to complete district-established graduation requirements by the end of the foster youth's fourth year of high school, the foster youth shall not be exempted from those requirements. Within 30 calendar days of the following academic year, the foster youth shall be reevaluated based on the foster youth's course completion status at the time, to determine if the student continues to be reasonably able to complete the district-established graduation requirements in time to graduate by the end of the foster youth's fourth year of high school. Written notice as to whether the foster youth then qualifies for the exemption shall be provided to the foster youth, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth, and if applicable, to the foster youth's social worker or probation officer.  (Education Code 51225.1)

If, upon reevaluation, it is determined that the foster youth is not reasonably able to complete the district-established graduation requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the foster youth's fourth year of high school, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the foster youth with the option to receive an exemption from district-established graduation requirements or stay in school for a fifth year to complete the district-established graduation requirements upon agreement with the foster youth, or if under 18 years of age, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth, and provide notifications in accordance with Education Code 51225.1.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, the district is required to consult with a foster youth who is granted an exemption from district-established graduation requirements and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth, as described below.
When a foster youth is exempted from district-established graduation requirements, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth about the following:  (Education Code 512251.)

	Discussion of how any requirements that are waived may affect the foster youth's postsecondary education or vocation plans, including the ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution
	 
	Discussion and information about other options available to the student, including, but not limited to, a fifth year of high school, possible credit recovery, and any transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges
	 
	Consideration of the foster youth's academic data and any other information relevant to making an informed decision on whether to accept the exemption

The district shall not require or request a foster youth to transfer schools in order to qualify for an exemption and shall not grant any request made by a foster youth or any person acting on behalf of a foster youth for a transfer solely to qualify the foster youth for an exemption.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.1 prohibits the district from requiring a foster youth who is eligible for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements from accepting the exemption or being denied enrollment, as described below.
The Superintendent or designee shall not require a foster youth who is eligible for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements, and would otherwise be entitled to remain in attendance at the school, to accept the exemption or be denied enrollment in, or the ability to complete, courses for which the foster youth is otherwise eligible, including courses necessary to attend an institution of higher education, regardless of whether such courses are required for statewide graduation requirements.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.1 prohibits the district from revoking a foster youth's exemption from district-established graduation requirements.
If a foster youth is exempted from district-established graduation requirements the exemption shall not be revoked. Additionally, the exemption shall continue to apply after the termination of the court's jurisdiction over the student while still enrolled in school or if the foster youth transfers to another school or school district.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, the district may not require or request a foster youth who is exempted from district-established graduation requirements and completes statewide coursework requirements before the end of the foster youth's fourth year or high school to graduate early, as described below.
The Superintendent or designee shall not require or request a foster youth who is exempted from district-established graduation requirements and who completes the statewide coursework requirements before the end of the fourth year of high school, and would otherwise be entitled to remain in school, to graduate before the end of the foster youth's fourth year of high school.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, if the district determines that a foster youth who is eligible for the exemption from district-established graduation requirements is reasonably able to complete those requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the foster youth's fifth year, the district is required to provide the following.
Upon making a finding that a foster youth is reasonably able to complete district-established graduation requirements within the fifth year of high school, the Superintendent or designee shall:  (Education Code 51225.1)

	Consult with the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth of the option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the district-established graduation requirements and how that will affect the foster youth's ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution
	 
	Consult with and provide information to the foster youth about transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges
	 
	Upon agreement with the foster youth or, if under 18 years of age, the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth, permit the foster youth to stay in school for a fifth year to complete the district-established graduation requirements
	 
	Consult with the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth of the option to remain in the foster youth's school of origin

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, until January 1, 2028, when a foster youth who has completed the second year of high school transfers into the district from another school district or transfers between high schools within the district, and is not reasonably able to complete the district-established graduation requirements, but is reasonably able to complete the statewide coursework requirements within the foster youth's fifth year of high school, the district is required to exempt the foster youth from the district-established graduation requirements and provide the foster youth with the option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the statewide requirements. In such situations, consultation with the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth is required, as provided below.
When a foster youth who has completed the second year of high school transfers into the district from another school district or transfers between high schools within the district, and is not reasonably able to complete the district-established graduation requirements within the foster youth's fifth year of high school but is reasonably able to complete the statewide coursework requirements within the fifth year of high school, the foster youth shall be exempted from all district-established graduation requirements and provided with the option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the statewide requirements.

As with other complaints covered under the uniform complaint procedures, a complainant may appeal the district's decision to CDE and, if the district or CDE finds any merit in the complaint, the district must provide a remedy to the affected student. See BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.
Any complaint alleging that the district has not complied with requirements regarding the education of foster youth may be filed in accordance with the district's procedures in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures. If the district finds merit in a complaint, the district shall provide a remedy to the affected student. A complainant not satisfied with the district's decision may appeal the decision to the California Department of Education (CDE) and shall receive a written decision regarding the appeal within 60 days of CDE's receipt of the appeal. If CDE finds merit in an appeal, the district shall provide a remedy to the affected student.  (Education Code 48853, 48853.5, 49069.5, 51225.1, 51225.2)
