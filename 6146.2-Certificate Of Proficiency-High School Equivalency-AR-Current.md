Certificate of Proficiency

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48412, the State Board of Education (SBE) will award a "certificate of proficiency" to persons who pass the California High School Proficiency Examination (CHSPE) established by the California Department of Education (CDE) to assess proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics skills.  A list of test centers and testing dates is available on the CHSPE web site. As amended by SB 820 (Ch. 110, Statutes of 2020), Education Code 48412 requires CDE to schedule testing dates at least once in the fall semester and once in the spring semester. The CDE will keep a permanent record of the issuance of all certificates.5 CCR 11523 requires the principal of each high school to distribute information about the exam to students in grades 11-12.  A flyer that may be used for this purpose is available on CDE's web site in both English and Spanish. At their discretion, districts may revise the following paragraph to require distribution of such information to students in grade 10.
The principal of each high school shall distribute to each student in grades 11-12 an announcement explaining the California High School Proficiency Examination (CHSPE). Announcements from the California Department of Education (CDE) or its contractor shall be distributed early enough to enable interested students to register for the test to be given in the fall of that year.  (5 CCR 11523)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph reflects CHSPE's Frequently Asked Questions on CDE's web site.
The principal also shall advise students that the certificate of proficiency awarded upon passing the CHSPE, while equivalent to a high school diploma, is not the equivalent of completing all coursework required for high school graduation and therefore students should contact the admissions office of the college or university they are interested in attending to determine if the certificate satisfies college admission requirements.

A student may take the CHSPE if the student meets one of the following conditions:  (Education Code 48412)

	Is age 16 or older
	 
	Has been enrolled in the 10th grade for one school year or longer
	 
	Will complete one school year of enrollment in 10th grade at the end of the semester during which the CHSPE will be administered

If a student receives the certificate of proficiency, the district shall indicate the student's accomplishment and the date of the award on the student's official transcript.  (5 CCR 11521)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 11522, the district must develop a consent form that may be used by persons receiving the certificate of proficiency to be exempted from compulsory school attendance.  See the accompanying exhibit for a sample consent form.
Any student who has received the certificate of proficiency may be exempted from compulsory school attendance upon the student's request, with verified parent/guardian consent as appropriate.  For this purpose, the Superintendent or designee shall provide a consent form which contains at least the following information:  (Education Code 48410; 5 CCR 11522)

	A general explanation of the student's rights of exemption from compulsory attendance and of re-enrollment in the public high schools
	 
	The date of issuance of the certificate of proficiency
	 
	The signature of the parent/guardian and the date
	 
	The signature of the school administrator who has personally confirmed the authenticity of the parent/guardian's signature and the date

If a student age 16 or 17 terminates enrollment after receiving the high school proficiency certificate, the student may re-enroll in the district.  If the student subsequently terminates enrollment again, the student may be denied re-enrollment until the beginning of the following semester.  (Education Code 48414)

High School Equivalency Certificate

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51420-51427 provide that persons may be awarded the California High School Equivalency Certificate by taking a general educational development test and receiving a score that is at least as high as that determined by SBE to be equal to the standard of performance expected from high school graduates.  As of January 1, 2020, SBE has approved the use of two tests for this purpose: the General Educational Development (GED) test adopted by the General Educational Development Testing Service and the High School Equivalency Test (HiSET) provided by the Educational Testing Service.
An eligible person may earn a high school equivalency certificate by passing a general educational development test designated by the State Board of Education pursuant to Education Code 51420, including the General Educational Development (GED) test or the High School Equivalency Test (HiSET).

Any person is eligible to take a test leading to a high school equivalency certificate if the person is a resident of California or a member of the armed forces assigned to duty in California and meets any one of the following criteria:  (Education Code 51420; 5 CCR 11532)


	Is 18 years of age or older, or is within 60 days of the person's 18th birthday, regardless of enrollment status
	 
	Is not currently enrolled in school and is within 60 days of when the person would have graduated from high school had the person remained in school and followed the usual course of study
	 
	Is 17 years of age, has been out of school for at least 60 consecutive days, and provides a letter of request for the test from the military, a postsecondary educational institution, or a prospective employer
	 
	Is 17 years of age, has accumulated fewer than 100 units of high school credit, is confined to a state or county hospital or to an institution maintained by a state or county correctional facility, and meets other criteria listed in 5 CCR 11532
	 
	Is 17 years of age, has accumulated fewer than 100 units of high school credit prior to enrollment in an academic program offered by a dropout recovery high school as defined in Education Code 52052, and has successfully completed the dropout recovery high school's instructional program which is aligned to state standards, offers the opportunity for a high school diploma, and provides services for at least one year
