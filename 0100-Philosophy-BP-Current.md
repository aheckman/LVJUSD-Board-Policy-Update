## Policy Content

In order to establish and support a guiding vision for the district, the Governing Board shall develop, articulate, and regularly review an overarching set of fundamental principles which describe the district's core beliefs, values, and tenets. The Board and district staff shall incorporate these principles into all programs, activities, and operations of the district.

CSBA NOTE: The thought process and collaborative effort required of the Governing Board in articulating district philosophy are crucial to the creation and evolution of philosophy reflective of local ideologies. Districts are strongly encouraged to engage in thoughtful discussions and to replace or supplement the philosophical statements below with those that reflect their own locally developed philosophical statements. 
It is the philosophy of the district that:

	All students can learn and succeed.
	 
	Every student should have an opportunity to receive a quality education regardless of his/her social, cultural, or economic background.
	 
	Every student in the district has a right to be free from discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying, as prohibited by law or district policy.
	 
	The future of our nation and community depends on students possessing the skills to be lifelong learners, collaborative and creative problem solvers, and effective, contributing members of a global and technologically advanced society.
	 
	Highly skilled and dedicated teachers and educational support staff have the capacity to guide students toward individual achievement and growth, and have a direct and powerful influence on student learning and life experiences.
	 
	A safe, nurturing environment and positive school climate are necessary for learning, academic achievement, and student development.
	 
	Parents/guardians have a right and an obligation to be engaged in their child's education and to be involved in the intellectual, physical, emotional, and social development and well-being of their child.
	 
	The needs of the whole child must be addressed, as the ability of children to learn is affected by social, health, and economic conditions and other factors outside the classroom.
	 
	Early identification of learning and behavioral difficulties and timely and appropriate support and intervention contribute to student success.
	 
	Students and staff are encouraged and motivated by high expectations and recognition for their accomplishments.
	 
	School improvement is a dynamic process requiring flexibility and innovation to meet the needs of students in a changing world.
	 
	Professional development for the Board and district staff is essential for the growth and success of the district and its students.
	 
	The diversity of the student body and school staff enriches the learning experience, promotes cultural awareness and acceptance, and serves as a model for citizenship in a global society.
	 
	A common set of norms and protocols is crucial to effective governance.
	 
	Communication, trust, respect, collaboration, and teamwork strengthen the relationship among Board members and between the Board and Superintendent, and contribute to the effectiveness of the governance team.
	 
	The community and district are inextricably connected partners, wherein the community's engagement in issues that impact the schools enhances the district's programs and student learning.
	 
	Two-way communication with all stakeholders is essential for establishing continuity, support, and shared goals both within the district and with the surrounding community.
	 
	The Board has a responsibility to advocate on behalf all students, keep current on legislative issues affecting education, and build positive relationships with local, state, and federal representatives.
	 
	A fiscally sound budget which is reflective of the district's vision is imperative to the financial stability of the district and to the attainment of its goals.
	 
	Responsibility for district programs and operations is shared by the entire educational community, with ultimate accountability resting with the Board as the basic embodiment of representative government.
