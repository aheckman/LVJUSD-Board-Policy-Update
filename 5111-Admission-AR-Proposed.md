## Policy Content

Parents/guardians should go to the school within their attendance area to register and enroll their children. Parents/guardians who are new to our District may contact the Student Services Department to obtain information about schools of residence and space availability. Students shall be admitted at any time during the school year.

 

Residency Requirements

 

Residency refers to the requirement that all students, unless approved on an interdistrict transfer agreement, shall be current residents living within the geographical boundaries of the District. A residence is the student and parent/guardian's place of domicile while enrolled in school.

Ownership of real property within the District does not in and of itself constitute residency. Occasional visitation and overnight stays do not constitute residency.

Students shall not be admitted to schools in the District unless the family can provide proof of residency. Reasonable evidence of residency may be established by documentation including, but not limited to, one document from each of the three categories listed below: 


	Current picture ID of parent/guardian: Driver's license, CA issued ID, or passport, and
	 
	Current mortgage statement; escrow papers that show close of sale no later than seven (7) calendar days after the student's first day of school; grant deed; property tax bill; lease/rental agreement, including property address, names of occupants, signatures of both parties with 2 months of canceled checks; or bank transfer records with the school year, and
	 
	Current Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), garbage, cable, or water bill with name and address listed (within 45 days for new home purchases/rentals).


Additional documentation may be required for further verification. Documentation may include, but is not limited to, the following:


	Income tax records reflecting the child's District residency address
	 
	Court documents including custodial responsibilities


If a student is not living with his/her parent(s) or if both the student and the parent(s) are living in a home where the parent's name does not appear on the proof of residence, both the parent and the caregiver with whom the student resides shall sign an appropriate affidavit of residency. The caregiver shall submit proof of residence with the affidavit. Affidavits shall be renewed annually.

Falsification of the proof of residence will jeopardize registration priority in the District and/or enrollment priority in a school of choice. The District routinely checks addresses to verify the residency. This may include a home visitation.

Documentation of Age/Grade

Prior to the admission of a child to kindergarten or first grade, the parent/guardian shall present proof of the child's age.  (Education Code 48002)

Evidence of the child's age may include:  (Education Code 48002) 


	A certified copy of a birth certificate or a statement by the local registrar or county recorder certifying the date of birth
	 
	A duly attested baptism certificate
	 
	A passport
	 
	When none of the above documents is obtainable, an affidavit of the parent/guardian
	 
	Other means prescribed by the Board


Age of Admittance to Transitional Kindergarten, Kindergarten and First Grade

At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall enroll any eligible child whose fifth or sixth birthday is on or before September 1 of that year into kindergarten or first grade, as applicable.  (Education Code 48000, 48010)

Admission into transitional kindergarten shall be in accordance with law and as specified in BP 6170.1 - Transitional Kindergarten.  (Education Code 48000)

On a case-by-case basis, and with the approval of the child's parent/guardian, a child who will turn five years old in a given school year may be enrolled in kindergarten at any time during that school year provided that:  (Education Code 48000)


	The Board of Education determines that admittance is in the best interest of the child.
	 
	The parent/guardian is given information regarding the advantages and disadvantages and any other explanatory information about the effect of this early admittance.


The Superintendent or designee shall make a recommendation to the Board regarding whether a child should be granted early entry to kindergarten, as appropriate. In doing so, the Superintendent or designee shall consider various factors including the availability of classroom space and any negotiated maximum class size.

Enrollment of Students

Enrollment refers to the placement of a registered District student on the rolls of a school. The school's process shall be consistent with these regulations.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually review enrollment capacity at all school sites to determine space availability for purposes of enrollment, open enrollment, intradistrict transfers and interdistrict transfer requests. Available space is determined by the program capacity, staffing entitlement, and facilities.

New Student Enrollment dates are posted on the District website for the upcoming school year, additional information is published on the District Website, on the Student Services Page.

Enrollment Priority Phases

New students entering the District for the first time in grades TK through 12 receive enrollment priority based upon the phase that they complete the enrollment process. Specific dates for each phase are published annually on the District website. 

Additional conditions to priority placement for students on both the Displaced and Waitlists are defined below. Phase 1, 2 and 3 lists will be placed in that order.

Displaced Students

When students cannot be placed at their resident school, the following will occur: 


	Staff from the resident school will inform the parents/guardians that space is not currently available but assistance will be provided to find an alternate site.
	 
	School staff will contact Student Services to obtain information about alternative school options with available space. Student Services will provide information on available spaces and contact the recommended school that a referral will be coming. School staff will provide this information to the parent.
	 
	The alternative school recommended to the parent will be the closest available site geographically.
	 
	Parents/guardians will be directed to the space available at the school to register. If there are extenuating issues such as day care needs, transportation, or other hardship concerns, the parent may be referred to the Student Services Department for assistance.
	 
	Parents/guardians may leave their student on a displaced list at the resident school in case an opening occurs.
	 
	Displaced students will be the first priority considered for placement back to their resident school as space becomes available.


Enrollment Priorities for Admission

Enrollment of students at specific schools will be based on the following priorities: 


	Continuing registered and residing students in the school's attendance area.
	 
	Students displaced out of the school of residence during the previous school year and wanting to return to their resident school.
	 
	New students registered in the school's attendance area during the kindergarten enrollment and open enrollment dates.
	 
	Siblings of students approved during the open enrollment period. (intradistrict application during the open enrollment period required).
	 
	Siblings of students applying for a transfer after the open enrollment period. (intradistrict application required as necessary).
	 
	Children whose parent/guardian is a Livermore resident and employed at the requested school. (intradistrict application during the open enrollment period required).
	 
	Children whose parent/guardian is a Livermore resident and employed by the District but not at the requested school (intradistrict application during the open enrollment period required).
	 
	Students who enroll after the last school day of the year based on the following priorities: move-in date, proof of physical residency, and date of registration.
	 
	Students who have moved from their home school area into another attendance area after the cut-off date or last day of school but want to remain at their former school (intradistrict paperwork required).
	 
	Students applying for an intraDistrict transfer between the end of open enrollment and August 1st. (exception - siblings).
	 
	Students already enrolled in the District with an approved interdistrict transfer as long as they continue to meet the criteria of satisfactory attendance, academics and behavior.
	 
	Students whose parent/guardian will be moving to the District within 2 months (interdistrict transfer and proof of move required).
	 
	Students applying for an intradistrict transfer after June 1st.
	 
	New interdistrict transfer requests.


Should the need arise to make an exception to these priorities, the Director of Student Services and the principal will review the case to determine whether cause exists to make a change.

Placement of a student in a specific classroom is the decision of the school administration. Student class assignments will be posted or distributed by the school prior to the first student day of the school year.

Intradistrict transfer requests

Student Services maintains the intradistrict waiting lists so that an order can be established for placing students when space becomes available. Student Services assists the school sites in managing placement from the intradistrict transfer list during the school year. Displaced students have first priority for any openings and are not required to complete transfer paperwork in order to return to their resident school.

Intradistrict transfer lists shall be maintained by schools in the following situations, at the direction of Student Services:


	Students who applied for an intradistrict transfer during the open enrollment period but were not placed.
	 
	Students who applied for an intradistrict transfer after the open enrollment period but were not placed.


Waiting lists will be maintained for one year and will document the date and time of any parent/guardian contact. They are established at the end of the open enrollment period and expire March 1st of the following year.
 

All students who applied for an intradistrict transfer and were not placed shall resubmit an application in order to be considered for the next school year. Students who applied during open enrollment and had a waiting list placement must resubmit the transfer application for the following year. If an intradistrict transfer application is not resubmitted, the student will lose their place on the waiting list.
 

Lottery
 

When the number of enrollment applications in a grade level exceeds the available space, the District will hold a lottery (random selection process) to determine which students will be admitted and to establish a formalized waiting list. Twins will be considered together. All enrollment priorities will be followed.
 

When the number of intradistrict transfer applications exceed the available space in a certain grade, the District will hold a lottery (random selection process). (BP 5116.1).
 

In determining whether a child may be granted early entry to kindergarten, the Superintendent or designee may also consider the availability of classroom space and any negotiated maximum class size.
 

When none of the foregoing is obtainable, the parent/guardian may provide another appropriate means of proving the age of the child, such as an affidavit of the parent, guardian, or custodian of the minor, or any other appropriate means of proving the age of the child as prescribed by the Superintendent or designee of the Board of Education.
 

A student enrolling in a District school at any other grade level shall present records from his/her previous school District documenting his/her age and current grade level.

<p dir="ltr">Intradistrict transfer lists shall be maintained by schools in the following situations, at the direction of Student Services:</p>

<ol dir="ltr" start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Students who applied for an intradistrict transfer during the open enrollment period but were not placed.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Students who applied for an intradistrict transfer after the open enrollment period but were not placed.</li>
</ol>

<div dir="ltr">Waiting lists will be maintained for one year and will document the date and time of any parent/guardian contact. They are established at the end of the open enrollment period and expire March 1st of the following year.<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div dir="ltr">All students who applied for an intradistrict transfer and were not placed shall resubmit an application in order to be considered for the next school year. Students who applied during open enrollment and had a waiting list placement must resubmit the transfer application for the following year. If an intradistrict transfer application is not resubmitted, the student will lose their place on the waiting list.<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div dir="ltr"><strong>Lottery</strong><br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div dir="ltr">When the number of enrollment applications in a grade level exceeds the available space, the District will hold a lottery (random selection process) to determine which students will be admitted and to establish a formalized waiting list. Twins will be considered together. All enrollment priorities will be followed.<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div dir="ltr">When the number of intradistrict transfer applications exceed the available space in a certain grade, the District will hold a lottery (random selection process). (BP 5116.1).<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div dir="ltr">In determining whether a child may be granted early entry to kindergarten, the Superintendent or designee may also consider the availability of classroom space and any negotiated maximum class size.<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div dir="ltr">When none of the foregoing is obtainable, the parent/guardian may provide another appropriate means of proving the age of the child, such as an affidavit of the parent, guardian, or custodian of the minor, or any other appropriate means of proving the age of the child as prescribed by the Superintendent or designee of the Board of Education.<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div dir="ltr">A student enrolling in a District school at any other grade level shall present records from his/her previous school District documenting his/her age and current grade level.</div>
