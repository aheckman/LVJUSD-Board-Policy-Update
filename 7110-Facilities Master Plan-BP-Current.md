## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to the School Facility Program (Education Code 17070.10-17079.30), the State Allocation Board (SAB) and Office of Public School Construction administer state funding programs for new construction, modernization, career technical education facilities, charter school facilities, critically overcrowded school facilities, facility hardships, seismic mitigation, high performance incentives (environmentally efficient schools), joint use programs, labor compliance, overcrowding relief, emergency repairs, and deferred maintenance.For additional information about the facilities master planning process, see CSBA's fact sheet, "Facilities Master Planning." In addition, CSBA's Facilities Planning program provides assistance with enrollment projections and/or the development of facilities master plans.Although not required by law, the California Department of Education's (CDE) publication, "Educational Specifications: Linking Design of School Facilities to Educational Program," recommends that the district's facilities master plan be adopted by formal resolution of the Governing Board.
The Governing Board recognizes the importance of long-range planning for school facilities in order to address changes in student enrollment, teacher housing needs, and the district's educational program. The Superintendent or designee shall develop, for Board approval, a master plan for district facilities which describes the district's anticipated short- and long-term facilities needs and priorities.

Plan Development

The district's facilities master plan shall be based on an assessment of the condition and adequacy of existing facilities, a projection of future enrollments, and alignment of facilities with the district's vision for the instructional program.

To solicit broad input into the planning process, the Superintendent or designee may establish a facilities advisory committee consisting of staff, parents/guardians, and business, local government, and other community representatives.  The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the public is informed of the need for construction and modernization of facilities and of the district's plans for facilities.

At least 45 days prior to completion of any facilities plan that relates to the potential expansion of existing school sites or the necessity to acquire additional school sites, the Superintendent or designee shall notify and provide copies of the plan or any relevant and available information to the planning commission or agency of the city or county with land use jurisdiction within the district.  (Government Code 65352.2)

If the city or county commission or agency requests a meeting, the Superintendent or designee shall meet with the commission or agency within 15 days following the notification.  Items that the parties may discuss at the meeting include, but are not limited to, methods of coordinating planning with proposed revitalization efforts and recreation and park programs, options for new school sites, methods of maximizing the safety of persons traveling to and from the site, and opportunities for financial assistance.  (Government Code 65352.2)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. In its "Public School Construction Cost Reduction Guidelines," SAB recommends that facilities master plans be reevaluated whenever a new construction project is initiated or at intervals not exceeding five years.
The master plan shall be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect changes in the educational program, existing facilities, finances, or demographic data.

Plan Components

CSBA NOTE: CDE's publication, "Educational Specifications: Linking Design of School Facilities to Educational Program (Appendix 1)," recommends components that should be addressed in the facilities master plan. Items #1-8 below are optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The facilities master plan shall include:

	A statement of purpose, including district goals, philosophy, and related policies
	 
	A description of the planning process
	 
	Demographics of the community, such as economic trends, migration patterns, employment base, residential base, socioeconomic makeup, historical school enrollments, and inventory of physical resources and needs
	 
	A description of the educational program, such as grade-level organization, class size, staffing patterns, technology plans, special programs and support services, and other educational specifications
	 
	Analysis of the safety, adequacy, and equity of existing facilities and potential for expansion, including the adequacy of classrooms, school cafeterias and food preparation areas, physical activity areas, playgrounds, parking areas, and other school grounds
	 
	Site selection criteria and process
	 
	Development of a capital planning budget and identification of potential funding sources
	 
	Policy for reviewing and updating the plan

Planning shall ensure that school facilities meet the following minimum standards:  (5 CCR 14001)


	Are aligned with the district's educational goals and objectives
	 
	Provide for maximum site enrollment at school facilities
	 
	Are located on a site that meets California Department of Education standards as specified in 5 CCR 14010
	 
	Are designed for the environmental comfort and work efficiency of the occupants
	 
	Are designed to require a practical minimum of maintenance
	 
	Are designed to meet federal, state, and local statutory requirements for structure, fire, and public safety
	 
	Are designed and engineered with flexibility to accommodate future need

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 14030 delineates detailed standards for developing plans for the design and construction of school facilities. All school districts must comply with these standards, whether a project is state funded or locally funded. Other legal requirements for facilities plans, including Education Code 16011, 16322, and 17251, vary depending on the funding source and type of project.Pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 USC 12101-12213) and 28 CFR 35.150 and 35.151, district facilities must be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. In achieving compliance, a district need not make structural changes to existing facilities if other methods are effective and the district can demonstrate that the structural change would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the activity or an undue financial or administrative burden. However, all newly constructed facilities must comply with the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Designs pursuant to 28 CFR 35.151. CSBA's ADA Compliance Program offers a variety of accessibility services including, but not limited to, facilities inspections and planning to transition facilities into full ADA compliance.California Green Building Standards Code, Title 24, Part 11 of the California Code of Regulations, ("CALGreen") establishes both mandatory requirements and voluntary standards for "green" building, which apply to all new construction and are applicable to K-12 schools. CALGreen addresses five major areas: (1) planning and design, (2) energy efficiency, (3) water efficiency, (4) material conservation and resource efficiency, and (5) indoor environmental quality.Health and Safety Code 53570-53574, The Teacher Housing Act of 2016, authorizes districts to establish and implement programs that address the housing needs of teachers and district employees facing challenges in securing affordable housing. Pursuant to Education Code 17283.5 and Government Code 4454.5, as added by AB 306 (Ch. 49, Statutes of 2021), residential housing, defined as any building used as a personal residence by a teacher or employee of a district, with the teacher's or employee's family, is specifically exempt from obtaining approval from the Department of General Services for earthquake safety (Field Act) and access by persons with disabilities.
Plans for the design and construction of new school facilities shall also meet the standards described in 5 CCR 14030, the California Green Building Standards Code, Title 24, Part 11 of the California Code of Regulations ("CALGreen"), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) pursuant to 42 USC 12101-12213, and any other requirements applicable to the funding source and type of project.

However, plans for residential housing, which includes any building used or intended to be used by the district as a personal residence by a teacher or employee of the district, is not considered to be a "school building" and does not require approval by the Department of General Services regarding earthquake safety and/or the ADA. (Education Code 17283.5; Government Code 4454.5)

CSBA NOTE: Subject to the availability of funds, districts may apply pursuant to Education Code 17077.40-17077.45 to fund joint use projects which are part of (1) a qualifying new construction project that will either increase the size and/or create extra costs beyond that necessary for school use of the multipurpose room, gymnasium, child care facility, library, or teacher education facility; or (2) a modernization project or a stand-alone project to provide for a multipurpose room, gymnasium, child care facility, library, or teacher education facility at a school that does not have the type of facility needed or has an inadequate facility.
To facilitate the efficient use of public resources when planning for new construction or modernization of school facilities, the district may consider designs that facilitate joint use of the facility with a local governmental agency, public postsecondary institution, or nonprofit organization.
