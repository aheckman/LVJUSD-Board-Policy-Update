The District does not discriminate on the basis of sex in any of its programs or activities and complies with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulations.

The Board of Education is committed to providing a safe work environment that is free of discrimination, harassment, and intimidation, including sexual harassment. The Board prohibits sexual harassment, as defined in the accompanying administrative regulation, in District programs and activities by and against District employees. For purposes of this policy and accompanying administrative regulation, employees include interns, volunteers, contractors, job applicants, and other persons with an employment relationship with the District.

Additionally, the Board prohibits retaliatory behavior or action against any person who complains or testifies about conduct that reasonably may constitute sexual harassment, reports such conduct, or otherwise participates or refuses to participate in the complaint process established for the purpose of this policy.  (Education Code 220.1; 34 CFR 106.71)

The Superintendent or designee shall take all actions necessary to ensure the prevention, investigation, and correction of sexual harassment, including but not limited to:  (Education Code 231.5; Government Code 12950.1; 2 CCR 11023; 34 CFR 106.8, 106.45)

The Superintendent or designee may periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the District's strategies to prevent and address harassment. Such evaluation may involve conducting regular anonymous employee surveys to assess whether harassment is occurring or is perceived to be tolerated, partnering with researchers or other agencies with the needed expertise to evaluate the District's prevention strategies, and using any other effective tool for receiving feedback on systems and/or processes. As necessary, changes shall be made to harassment policy(ies), complaint procedures, or training, as appropriate and in accordance with law.

Reports and Complaints

Any District employee who has experienced sexual harassment in the District's education program or activity may file a complaint with the District's Title IX Coordinator.  (34 CFR 106.8)

Additionally, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure that any implementation of Administrative Regulation 4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 - Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures, concurrently meets the requirements of Administrative Regulation 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment.

Before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed, the Title IX Coordinator shall offer and coordinate supportive measures to be provided to the complainant and the respondent, as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.  (34 CFR 106.30, 106.44)
