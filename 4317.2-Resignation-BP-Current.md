Any district employee who desires to resign his/her position shall submit, in writing, a letter of resignation which indicates the date which the employee intends as his/her last day at work.  The Governing Board encourages employees to provide advance notice that is appropriate for the position they hold.

CSBA NOTE: Option 1 below is for use by districts in which the Board accepts the resignation of employees and fixes their effective dates.  Option 2 is for use by Boards that delegate to the Superintendent or designee the authority to accept resignations and set their effective dates.
OPTION 1: An employee's written resignation shall be submitted to the Board in care of the Superintendent or designee.  The Board shall set the date when the resignation takes effect.  Once the date is formally set by the Board, the resignation may not thereafter be withdrawn by the employee.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  The Board authorizes the Superintendent or designee to accept an employee's written resignation and to set its effective date. Once the Superintendent or designee has accepted and set an effective date for this resignation, the resignation may not thereafter be withdrawn by the employee.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: Option 1 below is for use by districts in which the Board accepts the resignation of employees and fixes their effective dates.  Option 2 is for use by Boards that delegate to the Superintendent or designee the authority to accept resignations and set their effective dates.
The effective date of the resignation shall be a date not later than the close of the school year during which the resignation is received.  However, an employee and the Board may agree that a resignation will be accepted at a mutually agreed upon date not later than two years beyond the close of the school year during which the resignation is received by the Board.   (Education Code 44930, 45201)
