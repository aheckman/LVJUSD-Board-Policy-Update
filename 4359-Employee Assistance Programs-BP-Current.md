## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is optional and may be covered by the district's collective bargaining agreement.
The Governing Board recognizes that school district employees may have problems which can have detrimental effects upon job performance and student safety.  The Board encourages employees to seek help when such problems exist and to take advantage of the resources that are available to assist them.

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 8355 and 41 USC 8101-8106, the state and federal Drug-Free Workplace Acts, require the district to inform its employees about any drug counseling, rehabilitation and employee assistance programs available to them.
Employees shall have confidential access to information about the district's employee assistance program.  This information shall be available to all employees and their spouses and dependents.

Management and supervisory staff shall be knowledgeable about the district's employee assistance program and may counsel employees about the program, as appropriate.

Participation in the assistance program shall not jeopardize an employee's employment or career advancement, nor will it protect the employee from disciplinary action for substandard job performance.
