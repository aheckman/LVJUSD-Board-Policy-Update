## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that all District staff and students must be prepared to respond quickly and responsibly to emergencies, disasters, and threats of disaster. The District shall take all reasonable steps to prevent and/or mitigate the impact of a disaster on District students, staff, and schools.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop and maintain a disaster preparedness plan which contains routine and emergency disaster procedures, including, but not limited to, earthquake emergency procedures, and adaptations for individuals with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Such procedures shall be incorporated into the comprehensive school safety plan.  (Education Code 32282)

In developing the disaster preparedness plan, the Superintendent or designee shall involve District staff at all levels, including administrators, District police or security officers, facilities managers, transportation managers, food services personnel, school psychologists, counselors, school nurses, teachers, classified employees, and public information officers. As appropriate, the Superintendent shall also collaborate with law enforcement, fire safety officials, emergency medical services, health and mental health professionals, parents/guardians, and students.

The plan shall comply with state-approved Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) guidelines established for multiple-jurisdiction or multiple-agency operations and with the National Incident Management System.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to employees regarding their responsibilities, including periodic drills and exercises to test and refine staff's responsiveness in the event of an emergency.

The Board shall grant the use of school buildings, grounds, and equipment to public agencies, including the American Red Cross, for mass care and welfare shelters during disasters or other emergencies affecting the public health and welfare. The Board shall cooperate with such agencies in furnishing and maintaining whatever services the District may deem necessary to meet the community's needs.  (Education Code 32282)

District employees are considered disaster service workers and are subject to disaster service activities assigned to them.  (Government Code 3100)
