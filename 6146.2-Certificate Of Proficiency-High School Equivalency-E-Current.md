CSBA NOTE: The following exhibit is for use by districts that maintain grades 9-12.  Pursuant to Education Code 48410, any student who passes the California High School Proficiency Examination and receives a certificate of proficiency may be exempted from compulsory school attendance upon request by the student and, if the student is under age 18 years, with the consent of the student's parent/guardian.  5 CCR 11522 requires the district to develop a consent form for this purpose.  The following exhibit may be revised to reflect district practice.
NOTICE AND CONSENT TO DISCONTINUE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE FOR STUDENTS WITH A CERTIFICATE OF PROFICIENCY

Notice  of  Student  Rights:    Students  who  pass  the  California  High  School  Proficiency Examination (CHSPE) and receive a Certificate of Proficiency issued by the State Board of Education  may  continue  to  attend  school,  but  upon  request  will  be  exempted  from compulsory school attendance pursuant to Education Code 48410.  If the student is under 18 years of age, the student's parent/guardian must also provide approval in order for the student to discontinue school attendance.

If the student leaves school after receiving a Certificate of Proficiency and is under 18 years of age, the student may later decide to re-enroll in the district with no adverse consequences. In this case, the student may be required to meet new or additional requirements established since the student was previously enrolled.  If the student re-enrolls and then leaves school again, the student may be denied re-admittance until the beginning of the following semester.

For further information about leaving school after obtaining the Certificate of Proficiency, contact the principal or school guidance counselor.
