## Policy Content

Use of Metal Detectors

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that use metal detectors; see the accompanying Board policy. In 75 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 155 (1992), the Attorney General suggests several safeguards to minimize the intrusion of student privacy. The following list reflects these safeguards and should be revised to reflect district practice and the type(s) of metal detectors that will be used.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the following safeguards are used when making metal detector scans:


	Before walk-through, students shall be asked to empty their pockets and belongings of metallic objects.
	 
	If an initial metal detector activation occurs, students shall be asked to remove other metallic objects that they may be wearing (e.g., belt and jewelry) and to walk through a second time.
	 
	If a second activation occurs, a hand-held metal detector shall be used.
	 
	If the activation is not eliminated or explained, staff shall escort the student to a private area where an expanded search shall be conducted by a staff member of the same gender as the student in the presence of another district employee.
	
	CSBA NOTE: The Attorney General recommends that, upon activation of the metal detector, any subsequent search be limited to the detection of the metal that caused the activation in the first place. For example, a school official should not use the activation to search a container which obviously could not hold a weapon.
	The search shall be limited to the detection of the cause of the activation.

Use of Contraband Detection Dogs

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for districts that use trained dogs for random and unannounced inspections for contraband. An Attorney General opinion (83 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 257 (2001)) states that students cannot be required to leave their belongings behind before exiting the classroom. The law is unclear whether students can be "asked" to leave their belongings and whether such a request would result in an unconstitutional "seizure" of their property. Districts that wish to institute such a procedure should consult legal counsel, as appropriate; see the accompanying Board policy.
Contraband detection dogs shall not be used in classrooms or other district facilities when the rooms are occupied, except for demonstration purposes with the handler present.  When used for demonstration purposes, the dog shall be separated from the students and not allowed to sniff any individual.

Prior to conducting an inspection, students shall be asked to leave the room that will be subject to the canine sniff.  No student shall be forced to leave personal items behind for inspection, unless school officials have reasonable suspicion to search the item. 

Only the dog's official handler shall determine what constitutes an alert by the dog.  If the dog alerts on a particular item or place, the student having the use of that item or place, or responsibility for it, shall be called to witness the inspection.  If a dog alerts on a locked vehicle, the student who brought the vehicle onto district property shall be asked to unlock it for inspection.

Notifications

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section should be modified to reflect district practice. Districts that have not established a contraband dog detection and/or metal detector program should delete items #2 and 3 below.
At the beginning of each school year and upon enrollment, the Superintendent or designee shall inform students and parents/guardians about the district's policies and procedures for searches, including notice regarding:


	The possibility of random searches of students, their belongings, their vehicles parked on district property, and district properties under a student's control, including lockers or desks 
	 
	The district's contraband dog detection program 
	
	CSBA NOTE: To further minimize the privacy intrusion resulting from metal detector scans, the Attorney General recommends, in 75 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 155 (1992), giving advance notice of metal detector searches. Because no court decisions yet indicate whether prior notice to parents at the beginning of the year would be sufficient without giving separate notice for each search, the district, with legal counsel, should decide on a case-by-case basis whether a search will be announced or unannounced.
	The use of metal detector scans

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that signs are posted at all schools at which metal detectors are to be used to explain that anyone may be scanned by metal detector for guns, knives, or other illegal weapons when on campus or attending athletic or extracurricular events.
