## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation applies to food sales through the district's food service program, including, California's Universal Meals Program (Education Code 49501.5), the National School Lunch Program (42 USC 1751-1769j), the School Breakfast Program (42 USC 1773), and the Special Milk Program (42 USC 1772). The district should select all sections below that apply to programs offered by the district. See BP/AR 3552 - Summer Meal Program, AR 5148 - Child Care and Development, and AR 5148.2 - Before/After School Programs for nutrition requirements pertaining to those programs. For food sales outside the district's food service program (e.g., by student and adult organizations, through vending machines, or at student stores), see BP/AR 3554 - Other Food Sales.
Nutrition Standards for School Meals

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by all districts. Education Code 49501.5, as amended by SB 348 (Ch. 600, Statutes of 2023), requires all schools to make available, free of charge, one nutritiously adequate breakfast and one nutritiously adequate lunch each school day, to any student who requests a meal, regardless of a student's eligibility to participate in any federally-funded free or reduced-price meal. Schools participating in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program are required to extend meal service to all students enrolled in the school. However, pursuant to Education Code 49431, as amended by SB 95 (Ch. 318, Statutes of 2023), a school is not prohibited from selling an additional nutritiously adequate meal that qualifies for federal reimbursement from the same meal service to a student who has been provided a free meal.
Meals, food items, and beverages provided through the district's food services program shall:  (Education Code 49501.5, 49553; 42 USC 1758, 1773)

	Comply with National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program standards for meal patterns, nutrient levels, and calorie requirements for the ages/grade levels served, as specified in 7 CFR 210.10 or 220.8 as applicable
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #2 below reflects an additional requirement for (1) districts participating in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program which choose to apply for state reimbursements for free and reduced-price meals in addition to their base reimbursement, and (2) districts participating in the State Meal Program. Pursuant to Education Code 49430.7, such districts may not provide foods that are deep fried, par fried, or flash fried. Other districts may delete or use this item at their discretion. Although the California Universal Meals Program (Education Code 49501.5) is not expressly subject to this requirement, it is recommended that all districts comply with it as a best practice, since only meals that qualify for federal reimbursement are reimbursable by the state under the program.
	Not be deep fried, par fried, or flash fried, as defined in Education Code 49430 and 49430.7

Drinking Water

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by all districts. Pursuant to 42 USC 1758, schools participating in the National School Lunch Program are required to make free drinking water available for consumption at locations where meals are served during meal service. In addition, Education Code 38086 requires all California schools to make free drinking water available during school meal times. Pursuant to Education Code 38086, a district may be exempted from this requirement only if the Governing Board adopts a resolution, publicly noticed on at least two consecutive meeting agendas, demonstrating that the district is unable to comply due to fiscal constraints or health or safety concerns. Any district whose Board has adopted such a resolution should delete this section.Pursuant to Education Code 38086, schools may satisfy this requirement by, among other means, providing cups and containers of water or soliciting or receiving donated water. Pursuant to Education Code 38042, a district must allow students to bring and carry water bottles. Recommendations on the California Department of Education's (CDE) website include providing chilled water, ensuring that all water fountains are clean and operational, and encouraging water consumption through marketing and advertising. Pursuant to Education Code 38043, districts must encourage water consumption through promotional and educational activities and signage that focus on the benefits of drinking water and highlight water bottle filling stations throughout schools.
The district shall provide access to free, fresh drinking water during meal times in food service areas at all district schools, including, but not limited to, areas where reimbursable meals under the National School Lunch or Breakfast Program are served or consumed.  (Education Code 38086; 42 USC 1758)

Special Milk Program

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional. The Special Milk Program (42 USC 1772; 7 CFR 215.1-215.18) is a federally funded program which assists in providing milk at reasonable prices to students in schools that do not participate in the National School Lunch or Breakfast Program. Pursuant to 7 CFR 215.7, districts may choose to provide milk at no charge to students who qualify for free meals; see BP 3553 - Free and Reduced Price Meals.
Any school that does not participate in the National School Lunch or Breakfast Program may participate in the Special Milk Program to provide all enrolled students with reasonably priced milk.  (7 CFR 215.7)

Food Safety

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Health and Safety Code 113789, school cafeterias are among food facilities subject to the California Retail Food Code.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's food service program meets the applicable sanitation and safety requirements of the California Retail Food Code as set forth in Health and Safety Code 113700-114437.

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section is for use by any district participating in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program and may be used or revised by other districts at their discretion. 42 USC 1758 requires such participating districts to implement a food safety program applicable to any facility or part of a facility in which food is stored, prepared, or served. Pursuant to 42 USC 1758 and 7 CFR 210.13 and 220.7, the food safety program must comply with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles, which include establishing measures needed to prevent hazards at each stage of food production. Pursuant to 7 CFR 210.13, districts may implement either the "traditional" HACCP system or the simplified "process approach." Under the process approach, foods are grouped together according to preparation process and the same control measure is applied to all menu items within the group, rather than developing an HACCP plan for each item. These principles are described in USDA's, "Guidance for School Food Authorities: Developing a School Food Safety Program Based on the Process Approach to HACCP Principles".
For all district schools participating in the National School Lunch and/or School Breakfast Program, the Superintendent or designee shall implement a written food safety program for the storage, preparation, and service of school meals which complies with the national Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system. The district's HACCP plan shall include, but is not limited to, a determination of critical control points and critical limits at each stage of food production, monitoring procedures, corrective actions, and recordkeeping procedures.  (42 USC 1758; 7 CFR 210.13, 220.7)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 7 CFR 210.30, directors, managers, and staff in the food service program must complete annual training on specified topics, including, but not limited to, training on health and safety standards. Based on CDE Management Bulletin SNP-13-2020, districts must ensure that such directors, managers, and staff complete an annual continuing education or training on topics that are job-related, including, but not limited to, food safety standards. In addition, at least one employee at each food facility or site must have successfully passed an approved and accredited food safety certification examination in accordance with Health and Safety Code 113947.2-113947.3.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that food service directors, managers, and staff complete an annual continuing education or training as required by law. Each new employee, including a substitute, or volunteer shall complete initial food safety training prior to handling food. For each employee, the Superintendent or designee shall document the date, trainer, and subject of each training.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. USDA's, "Guidance for School Food Authorities: Developing a School Food Safety Program Based on the Process Approach to HACCP Principles," states that districts should maintain the following types of records in order to periodically review the food safety program and, in the event of a foodborne illness, to document that reasonable care was exercised in the operation of the school's food service program.
The Superintendent or designee shall assign staff to maintain records and logs documenting food safety activities, including, but not limited to, records of food deliveries, time and temperature monitoring during food production, equipment temperature (freezer, cooler, thermometer calibration), corrective actions, verification or review of safety efforts, and staff training.

Inspection of Food Facilities

CSBA NOTE: Health and Safety Code 113725-113725.3 require all food facilities in California to be inspected by the county environmental health agency in accordance with the timelines and procedures established in county regulations. The inspections cover all food service areas, including cafeterias, vending machines, and mobile food carts. Health and Safety Code 113725 specifies findings that would be considered violations, including (1) improper holding temperatures, improper cooling, or inadequate cooking of potentially hazardous foods (i.e., foods that require temperature control), (2) poor personal hygiene of food service employees, (3) contaminated equipment, and (4) food from unapproved sources.
All food preparation and service areas shall be inspected in accordance with Health and Safety Code 113725-113725.1 and applicable county regulations.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts participating in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program. Notwithstanding the requirements of county regulations, districts participating in these programs must obtain at least two safety inspections each school year.
Each school participating in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program shall, during each school year, obtain a minimum of two food safety inspections conducted by the county environmental health agency.  (42 USC 1758; 7 CFR 210.13, 220.7)

The Superintendent or designee shall retain records from the most recent food safety inspection. All schools shall post a notice indicating that the most recent inspection report is available to any interested person upon request. (Health and Safety Code 113725.1; 42 USC 1758; 7 CFR 210.13, 210.15, 220.7)

Pursuant to 42 USC 1758 and 7 CFR 210.13 and 220.7, the food safety program must comply with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles, which include establishing measures needed to prevent hazards at each stage of food production. Pursuant to 7 CFR 210.13, districts may implement either the "traditional" HACCP system or the simplified "process approach." Under the process approach, foods are grouped together according to preparation process and the same control measure is applied to all menu items within the group, rather than developing an HACCP plan for each item. These principles are described in USDA's, "Guidance for School Food Authorities: Developing a School Food Safety Program Based on the Process Approach to HACCP Principles".</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="AMjcNg6" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22AMjcNg6%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22zNA148%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1710115245%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20remainder%20of%20this%20section%20is%20for%20use%20by%20any%20district%20participating%20in%20the%20National%20School%20Lunch%20and/or%20Breakfast%20Program%20and%20may%20be%20used%20or%20revised%20by%20other%20districts%20at%20their%20discretion.%2042%20USC%201758%20requires%20such%20participating%20districts%20to%20implement%20a%20food%20safety%20program%20applicable%20to%20any%20facility%20or%20part%20of%20a%20facility%20in%20which%20food%20is%20stored%2C%20prepared%2C%20or%20served.%20Pursuant%20to%2042%20USC%201758%20and%207%20CFR%20210.13%20and%20220.7%2C%20the%20food%20safety%20program%20must%20comply%20with%20Hazard%20Analysis%20and%20Critical%20Control%20Point%20%28HACCP%29%20principles%2C%20which%20include%20establishing%20measures%20needed%20to%20prevent%20hazards%20at%20each%20stage%20of%20food%20production.%20Pursuant%20to%207%20CFR%20210.13%2C%20districts%20may%20implement%20either%20the%20%5C%22traditional%5C%22%20HACCP%20system%20or%20the%20simplified%20%5C%22process%20approach.%5C%22%20Under%20the%20process%20approach%2C%20foods%20are%20grouped%20together%20according%20to%20preparation%20process%20and%20the%20same%20control%20measure%20is%20applied%20to%20all%20menu%20items%20within%20the%20group%2C%20rather%20than%20developing%20an%20HACCP%20plan%20for%20each%20item.%20These%20principles%20are%20described%20in%20USDA%27s%2C%20%5C%22Guidance%20for%20School%20Food%20Authorities%3A%20Developing%20a%20School%20Food%20Safety%20Program%20Based%20on%20the%20Process%20Approach%20to%20HACCP%20Principles%5C%22.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-AMjcNg6" title="CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section is for us..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
