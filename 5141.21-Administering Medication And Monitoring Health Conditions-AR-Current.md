## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation reflects requirements for the administration of medication to students on a continuing medication regimen or in emergency medical situations at school or a school-related activity. The district should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel as necessary to ensure that all legal requirements are met.Education Code 49426.5, as added by AB 1722 (Ch. 853, Statutes of 2023), authorizes the district to hire a licensed vocational nurse following Governing Board approval that a diligent search was conducted in accordance with Education Code 49426.5. Upon hiring a vocational nurse, the district is required to certify to the California Department of Education (CDE) that a search was properly conducted. A hired vocational nurse is required to be supervised by a credentialed school nurse employed as a school nurse at the district or at another local educational agency.Pursuant to the general authority in Education Code 49423 and 5 CCR 600-611, as interpreted by the California Supreme Court in American Nurses Association v. Torlakson, health providers may train unlicensed school personnel to administer medication. Such administration must be contingent upon a physician's written authorization for unlicensed personnel to administer the medication to the particular student, unless otherwise authorized by law. The district may revise the following regulation to reflect any district requirements related to the administration of such medication.

Such districts may revise the following section to indicate the grade levels at which such medication will be available (e.g., at secondary schools only).
The district may elect to make emergency naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist available at schools for the purpose of providing emergency medical aid to persons suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an opioid overdose. In determining whether to make this medication available, the Superintendent or designee shall evaluate the emergency medical response time to the school and determine whether initiating emergency medical services is an acceptable alternative to providing an opioid antagonist and training personnel to administer the medication.  (Education Code 49414.3)

If a volunteer rescinds the offer to volunteer or is no longer able to act as a volunteer for any reason, or if the placement of a student changes and the student no longer has access to a trained volunteer, the district may distribute an additional two notices per school year to all staff.  (Education Code 49468.2)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49468.2, as added by AB 1810, the SPI established minimum standards of training to recognize and respond to seizures and for the administration of emergency anti-seizure medication, which are available on CDE's website and required to be updated every five years. The following paragraph reflects the minimum standards of training for volunteer(s) in order that they may administer emergency anti-seizure medication
Volunteer employees shall receive initial and annual refresher training, based on standards adopted by the SPI, regarding the recognition and response to seizures and the administration of emergency anti-seizure medication. The training shall be provided at no cost to the employee, conducted during regular working hours, and be provided by a school nurse or other qualified person designated by an authorizing physician and surgeon. Written materials provided during the training shall be retained at the school for reference.  (Education Code 49468.2)

Before administering emergency anti-seizure medication or therapy prescribed to treat seizures in a student diagnosed with seizures, a seizure disorder, or epilepsy, the district shall obtain from the student's parent/guardian a seizure action plan as specified in Education Code 49468.3. The school or district nurse shall collaborate with the parent/guardian of each student diagnosed with seizures, a seizure disorder, or epilepsy in the development of a plan if the student does not have an individualized education plan or Section 504 plan.  (Education Code 49468.3)

If the school obtains written consent from the student's parent/guardian, in accordance with 34 CFR 99.30, the seizure action plan shall be distributed to any school staff or volunteers responsible for the supervision or care of the student.  (Education Code 49468.3)

Upon receipt of a request from a parent/guardian of a student diagnosed with seizure, a seizure disorder, or epilepsy, the district shall notify the parent/guardian that the student may qualify for services or accommodations pursuant to Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or an individualized education program and shall assist the parent/guardian with the exploration of that option.  (Education Code 49468.2)

Additionally, if there are no volunteers at the student's school, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the student's parent/guardian of the student's right to be assessed for services and accommodations guaranteed under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and may ask the parent/guardian to sign such notices.  (Education Code 49468.2)

The principal or designee shall notify the school nurse assigned to the school, or if a school nurse is not assigned to the school or district, the Superintendent or designee, if an employee administers an emergency anti-seizure medication.  (Education Code 49468.3)

The notification described above and the seizure action plan shall be kept on file in the office of the school nurse or a school administrator, in compliance with all applicable state and federal privacy laws.  (Education Code 49468.3)

The district shall provide volunteers defense and indemnification for any and all civil liability, with information stating such being provided to the volunteer in writing and retained in the volunteer's personnel file.  (Education Code 49468.5)

Trained volunteers who administer emergency anti-seizure medication or medication prescribed for seizure disorder symptoms to a student diagnosed with seizures, a seizure disorder, or epilepsy who appears to be experiencing a seizure shall not be subject to professional review, be liable in a civil action, or be subject to criminal prosecution for acts or omissions in administering the emergency anti-seizure medication.  (Education Code 49468.5)

Upon hiring a vocational nurse, the district is required to certify to the California Department of Education (CDE) that a search was properly conducted. A hired vocational nurse is required to be supervised by a credentialed school nurse employed as a school nurse at the district or at another local educational agency.<br><br>Pursuant to the general authority in Education Code 49423 and 5 CCR 600-611, as interpreted by the California Supreme Court in American Nurses Association v.
