## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: In Jackson v. Pasadena City School District, the California Supreme Court affirmed the right of Boards to establish attendance areas, provided the exercise of such discretion is reasonable and does not violate the equal protection or due process rights of students.
The Governing Board shall establish school attendance boundaries in order to maximize the efficient use of district facilities and effective administration of district schools. The Superintendent or designee shall periodically review school attendance boundaries and, as necessary, make recommendations to the Board for boundary adjustments. 

When reviewing school attendance boundaries, the Superintendent or designee shall consider the following factors:

CSBA NOTE: Courts have held that school districts have an affirmative duty to prevent racial segregation (Jackson v. Pasadena City School District and Crawford v. Board of Education). In addition, Education Code 35753 requires the State Board of Education to analyze whether proposals to reorganize school districts will result in racial or ethnic discrimination and Education Code 35160.5 grants districts the authority to maintain appropriate racial and ethnic balances across district schools when adopting the district's intradistrict open enrollment policy. However, in Crawford v. Huntington Beach Union High School District, a California appellate court held that a district's intradistrict enrollment policy, which contained a racial and ethnic balance component as authorized by Education Code 35160.5, violated the constitutional provisions added by Proposition 209 (Article I, Section 31). Because of the potential for legal challenge, districts should consult legal counsel as appropriate.The following criteria are optional and should be modified to reflect district practice.

	School enrollment data, including declining enrollment patterns
	 
	Facility capacity and design, including potential commercial and residential developments
	 
	School feeder patterns, including maintaining, to the extent practicable, continuity of student attendance
	 
	Federal, state, or court mandates
	 
	Community input
	 
	Student safety
	 
	Transportation capacity
	 
	Community and neighborhood identity
	 
	Geographic features of the district, including traffic patterns
	 
	Educational programs, such as magnet schools and charter schools
	 
	Consistency between municipal boundaries and high school boundaries
	 
	Other factors

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that have established a community facilities district under the Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act (Government Code 53311-53317.5). Government Code 53312.7 mandates that such districts adopt a policy giving priority attendance access to students residing in the community facilities district whose residents have paid taxes that financed school construction, as specified below. For additional language fulfilling this mandate, see BP 7212 - Mello-Roos Districts.
Students residing in a community facilities district shall have priority, to the extent provided by law, for attendance at schools financed in whole or in part by the community facilities district.  The degree of priority must reflect the proportion of each school's financing provided through the community facilities district. (Government Code 53312.7)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional and should be revised to reflect district practice.
In order to alleviate overcrowding, the Superintendent or designee may place some students in a school outside of their attendance area.  Parents/guardians of students who are attending schools outside of their attendance area shall be notified of the school their child will be attending as soon as possible.  If available, transportation shall be provided for such students.
