## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation should be revised to reflect program(s) offered by the district.
Federal Grants for Career Technical Education (Perkins)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that receive basic grants to support programs of career technical education (CTE) pursuant to the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, often referred to as Perkins V (20 USC 2301-2355), which guarantees that each state will receive a minimum grant equal to 90 percent of its prior year allocation.During the Federal Program Monitoring (FPM) process, California Department of Education (CDE) staff will review whether the district uses these federal funds to supplement, not supplant, state and local funds for CTE activities, as required by 20 USC 2391, and whether funds are used for appropriate purposes as described in 20 USC 2355 and in the four-year state plan adopted pursuant to 20 USC 2342.
The district shall submit to the California Department of Education an application for a basic grant of the federal Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. The application shall address the components specified in 20 USC 2354 and any additional requirements specified in the state plan developed pursuant to 20 USC 2342.  (20 USC 2354)

The district shall conduct a needs assessment in accordance with 20 USC 2354, which shall be updated at least once every two years.  The needs assessment shall be conducted in consultation with representatives of district career technical education (CTE) programs, postsecondary CTE programs, state or local workforce development boards and businesses, parents/guardians, students, and other specified stakeholders.  (20 USC 2354)

CSBA NOTE: The district may use Perkins V and other federal, state, and/or district funds to meet the program requirements listed below.
To meet the needs identified in the needs assessment, the Superintendent or designee shall develop, coordinate, implement, or improve CTE programs that are of sufficient size, scope, and quality to be effective and that fulfill the following purposes:  (20 USC 2355)

	Provide career exploration and career development activities through an organized, systematic framework designed to aid students, including students in the middle grades, in making informed plans and decisions about future education and career opportunities and programs of study. Such activities shall occur before students enroll and while they are participating in a CTE program, and may include:
	 
	
		Introductory courses or activities focused on career exploration and career awareness, including non-traditional fields
		 
		Readily available career and labor market information, including information on occupational supply and demand, educational requirements, other information on careers aligned to economic priorities, and employment sectors
		 
		Programs and activities related to the development of student graduation and career plans
		 
		Career guidance and academic counselors who provide information on postsecondary education and career options
		 
		Any other activity that advances knowledge of career opportunities and assists students in making informed decisions about future education and employment goals, including nontraditional fields
		 
		Activities that provide students with strong experience in, and comprehensive understanding of, all aspects of an industry
		 
	
	
	Provide the skills necessary to pursue careers in high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand industry sectors or occupations
	 
	Integrate academic skills into CTE programs and programs of study to support participating students in meeting state academic standards
	 
	Provide professional development for teachers, school leaders, administrators, specialized instructional support personnel, guidance counselors, and/or paraprofessionals, which may include the types of activities listed in 20 USC 2355
	 
	Plan and carry out elements that support the implementation of CTE programs and programs of study and that result in increased student achievement. Such elements may include curriculum aligned with program requirements, sustainable relationships among community stakeholders, opportunities for students to participate in accelerated learning programs, equipment and instructional materials aligned with business and industry needs, and other activities specified in 20 USC 2355.
	 
	Develop and implement evaluations of the activities funded by the grant

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 2354, the district application for Perkins V funding must describe how individuals will not be discriminated against based on their status as members of "special populations," as defined in 20 USC 2302. In addition, a district that receives federal aid is required by 34 CFR 100 (Appendix B), 104.8, and 106.9 to take "continuing steps" to notify students, parents/guardians, employees, employee organizations, and applicants for admission and employment that it does not discriminate in its educational programs or activities. See BP 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities.During the FPM process, CDE staff will check whether the district complies with requirements to (1) ensure equitable access by special population students through outreach, recruitment, enrollment, and placement activities; (2) identify and adopt strategies to overcome barriers to access or success in the program; (3) ensure that counseling materials and activities, including student program selection and career/employment selection, and promotional and recruitment efforts are nondiscriminatory; and (4) advise students, parents/guardians, employees, and the general public, prior to the beginning of the school year, that all CTE opportunities are offered without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, or disability in accordance with 34 CFR 100 (Appendix B).
The district's program shall provide activities to prepare special populations for high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand industry sectors or occupations that will lead to self-sufficiency. Special populations shall be provided with equal access to CTE programs and shall not be unlawfully discriminated against.  Special populations include, but are not limited to, students with disabilities, students from economically disadvantaged families, pregnant and parenting students, out-of-work individuals, English learners, homeless students, foster youth, children of military families, and students preparing for nontraditional fields. Nontraditional fields include occupations or fields of work, including careers in computer science, technology, and other emerging high-skill occupations, for which individuals from one gender constitute less than 25 percent of the individuals employed in each such occupation or field of work.  (20 USC 2302, 2354, 2373)

Upon written request from a nonprofit private school within the geographical area served by the district, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with private school representatives in a timely and meaningful manner and may provide for the participation of private school secondary students in the district's programs and activities funded pursuant to 20 USC 2301-2414. To the extent practicable, the Superintendent or designee shall also, upon request, permit participation of CTE teachers, administrators, and other personnel from private schools in the district's inservice and preservice professional development programs funded through such grants.  (20 USC 2397)

Linked Learning Programs

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that offer "linked learning" programs integrating academic and career technical study (sometimes called "multiple pathways") and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The district shall offer one or more comprehensive, multi-year linked learning programs in grades 9-12 that are organized around a broad theme, interest area, or industry sector including, but not limited to, the industry sectors identified in model standards adopted by the State Board of Education pursuant to Education Code 51226. The program shall provide all participating students with curriculum choices that prepare them for career entry and a full range of postsecondary options, including two-year and four-year colleges, apprenticeships, and formal employment training.

At a minimum, the district's linked learning program shall include:

	An integrated core curriculum that meets the eligibility requirements for admission to the University of California (UC) and the California State University (CSU) and is delivered through project-based learning and other engaging instructional strategies that bring real-world context and relevance to the curriculum where broad themes, interest areas, and CTE are emphasized
	 
	An integrated technical core of a sequence of at least four related courses that may reflect CTE standards-based courses and that provide students with career skills, are aligned to academic principles, and fulfill academic core requirements described in Item #1 above to the extent possible
	 
	A series of work-based learning opportunities that begin with mentoring and job shadowing and evolve into intensive internships, school-based enterprises, or virtual apprenticeships
	 
	Support services, including supplemental instruction in reading and mathematics, that help students master the advanced academic and technical content that is necessary for success in college and career

Partnership Academies

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that have established a partnership academy pursuant to Education Code 54690-54699.1 and 54750-54760. A partnership academy functions as a school-within-a-school with a career theme and related academic courses primarily directed at students who are at risk of dropping out.
The district shall operate one or more partnership academies as a school-within-a-school focused on a broad career theme. The program shall be available to students in grades 10-12, at least half of whom shall be students who are at risk of dropping out of school as indicated by three or more of the following criteria:  (Education Code 54690-54691)

	Past record of irregular attendance, with absence from school 20 percent or more of the school year
	 
	Past record of underachievement in which the student is at least one-third of a year behind the coursework for the respective grade level, or as demonstrated by credits achieved
	 
	Past record of low motivation or disinterest in the regular school program
	 
	Economic disadvantage
	 
	Scores below basic or far below basic on the mathematics or English language arts test of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress
	 
	A grade point average of 2.2 or below or the equivalent of a C minus

Ninth-grade teachers and counselors shall identify students eligible to participate in a partnership academy. Participating students shall be selected by academy staff from among those who have expressed an interest in the academy and whose parents/guardians have approved the student's participation.  (Education Code 54695)

The district's program shall provide:  (Education Code 54692)

	During each regular school term, instruction in at least three academic subjects that:
	 
	
		Prepares students for a regular high school diploma
		 
		Where possible and appropriate, prepares students to meet subject requirements for admission to UC and CSU
		 
		Contributes to an understanding of the occupational field of the academy
		
		CSBA NOTE: Education Code 54692, as amended by AB 1923 (Ch. 114, Statutes of 2022), includes science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses as required alternative courses that must be offered to students participating in partnership academies.
	
	
	CTE or science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses offered at each grade level at the academy that are part of an occupational course sequence that targets comprehensive skills and meets the criteria specified in Education Code 54692
	 
	Classes that are block scheduled in a cluster whenever possible to provide flexibility to academy teachers and which may vary in number during grade 12
	 
	A mentor from the business community for students during grade 11
	 
	An employer-based internship or work experience that occurs during the summer following grade 11 or during grade 12
	 
	Additional motivational activities with private sector involvement to encourage academic and occupational preparation

Attendance in academy classes shall be limited to students enrolled in the academy.  (Education Code 54692)

The Superintendent or designee shall establish an advisory committee consisting of individuals involved in academy operations, including district and school administrators, lead teachers, and representatives of the private sector.  (Education Code 54692)

Apprenticeship Programs

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be used by districts that provide a program of "orientation to apprenticeships" to students who have not yet applied to an apprenticeship program. Such programs are sometimes referred to as "pre-apprenticeship programs." However, the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR), in its publication, "Orientation to Apprenticeship: A Guide for Educators," notes that "pre-apprentice" is used by some trades as a classification of worker and therefore prefers the term "orientation to apprenticeship" to refer to a program offered by secondary schools. Items #1-5 below reflect key program components recommended in the DIR publication and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The district shall offer high school and/or adult education students a program of orientation to apprenticeships that acquaints students with a broad range of career options, provides information regarding available apprenticeship programs, and provides classroom instructional job training which guides students to a registered apprenticeable occupation.

The district's program shall:

	Introduce students to what they need to know in order to apply, test, and interview for acceptance into an apprenticeship program
	 
	Demonstrate the need for proficiency in reading and comprehension, mathematics, science, and technology
	 
	Emphasize the necessity to have the ability to communicate in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and numeration skills
	 
	Identify the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to enter and successfully complete an apprenticeship program
	 
	Provide an orientation to a specific craft or trade or to an industry

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that contract with sponsors of approved apprenticeship programs (e.g., individual employers, labor or management apprenticeship committees, or joint labor-management apprenticeship committees) pursuant to Education Code 8150-8155 and Labor Code 3070-3099.5 to provide classes of related and supplemental instruction. Apprenticeship programs are offered for a period of one to six years (typically four years) and provide specialized on-the-job training that prepares an individual for employment in a craft or trade profession.
The district may enter into an agreement with a local business, labor or management apprenticeship committee, and/or joint labor-management apprenticeship committee that has been approved by the Department of Industrial Relations' Division of Apprenticeship Standards to sponsor an apprenticeship program in order to develop and deliver related and supplemental instruction to students participating in a registered apprenticeship program.  (Education Code 8150-8155; Labor Code 3074, 3075, 3078)

Regional Occupational Center/Program

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that partner with or offer their own local regional occupational center or program (ROC/P) pursuant to Education Code 52300-52335.12, and may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 52301 authorizes the establishment of an ROC/P by (1) the County Superintendent of Schools, with the approval of the State Board of Education (SBE); (2) two or more districts maintaining high schools, with the approval of SBE and the County Superintendent; or (3) a single district with an average daily attendance (ADA) of 50,000 or more located in a class 1 county or a district with an ADA of 100,000 or more located in a class 2 county, as defined in Education Code 1205. ROC/P courses are open to secondary students, with priority enrollment given to students ages 16-18 or in grades 11-12. See BP 6178.2 - Regional Occupational Center/Program for additional program requirements.
The district shall operate and/or partner with a regional occupational center or program (ROC/P), established pursuant to Education Code 52335.12, which offers CTE courses, linked learning programs, partnership academies, and/or pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs as appropriate.

Occupational course sequences offered by ROC/P shall provide prerequisite courses needed to enter apprenticeship or postsecondary vocational certificate or degree programs, focus on occupations requiring comprehensive skills leading to high entry-level wages and/or the possibility of significant wage increases after a few years on the job, offer as many courses as possible that meet college admission requirements, and lead to attainment of an occupational skill certificate.  (Education Code 52302)

Student Organizations

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be used by districts providing any CTE program(s). 20 USC 2355 permits the use of Perkins V funding to support career technical student organizations and related activities. According to CDE, state-supported organizations include California DECA: A Marketing Association (formerly Distributive Education Clubs of America), Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), Future Farmers of America (FFA), Future Homemakers of America-Home Economics Related Occupations (FHA-HERO), Health Occupations Students of America (HOSA), and Skills USA (formerly Vocational Industrial Clubs of America-VICA).
The district may provide support, including supplies, materials, activities, and advisor expenses, to student organizations which engage in activities that are integral to the CTE program and provide for the development of student leadership skills.  However, no state or federal funds shall be used to pay students' membership dues, food or lodging expenses, out-of-state travel, or the cost of a social activity or assemblage.
