## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to increase student access to information, support teacher effectiveness, and facilitate the administration of student assessments, as well as the potential for AI to undermine student achievement, health, and well-being. Therefore, the Board is committed to supporting the use of AI by students and staff in accordance with the following principles:

	Student-Centered: AI should be used to personalize and enhance the learning experience for each student and to support digital citizenship and literacy
	 
	Staff-Centered: AI should be used as a tool to augment and support, rather than replace, staff in the performance of their duties and responsibilities
	 
	Ethical Use and Transparency: AI should be used ethically and transparently by all staff and students, with careful consideration of potential biases, and in compliance with all applicable intellectual property and copyright laws
	 
	Accountability and Responsibility: AI should be used in a manner that ensures accountability by those who use it and that those who use it are responsible for such use, including when and how it is used
	 
	Equity and Access: AI should be implemented in a manner that ensures equitable access and opportunity for all students, regardless of background or ability, and for all schools across the District
	 
	Secure and Private: The District should prioritize security and privacy when changing existing practices or adopting new practices regarding AI
	 
	Professional Development: The District should provide ongoing professional development for staff in all aspects of AI, with a particular focus on the ethical and responsible use of AI
	 
	Community Engagement: The District should engage with the community to share these principles, to educate the community on AI, and to discuss the permitted and prohibited uses of AI in the District
	 
	Continuous Improvement: The District should regularly evaluate the use of AI by students and staff, and adapt its policies, procedures, and professional development to align with best practices and evolving technologies

The Superintendent shall ensure that the use of AI in the District is consistent with this policy, Board Policy/Exhibit (1) 4040 - Employee Use of Technology, Board Policy 5131.9 - Academic Honesty, Board Policy 6154 - Homework/Makeup Work, Board Policy 6162.5 - Student Assessment, and Board Policy/Exhibit (1) 6163.4 - Student Use of Technology.

Artificial intelligence means an engineered or machine-based system that varies in its level of autonomy and that can, for explicit or implicit objectives, infer, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs that can influence physical or virtual environments.  (Education Code 33328.5)
