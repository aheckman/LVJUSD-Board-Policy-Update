## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes that professional development enhances employee effectiveness and contributes to personal growth.  Staff development for administrative and supervisory personnel shall be designed to guide institutional improvement, build leadership skills, and enhance overall management efficiency.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060-52077, as added by AB 97 (Ch. 47, Statutes of 2013), require districts to develop a local control and accountability plan (LCAP) which includes goals aligned with state and local priorities, specific actions aligned to meet those goals, and a budget aligned to fund those specific actions; see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.  The district's staff development program should be aligned with its priorities and goals as outlined in the LCAP and other applicable district and school plans.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a plan for administrator support and development activities that is based on a systematic assessment of the needs of district students and staff and is aligned to the district's vision, goals, local control and accountability plan, and other comprehensive plans.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44517, the state's Administrator Training Program self-repealed on January 1, 2013. Funding for that program has been redirected into the local control funding formula pursuant to AB 97 (Ch. 47, Statutes of 2013). Thus, the content of the district's staff development program for administrators may be adapted to meet district needs.  Items #1-10 below are optional.
The district's staff development program for district and school administrators may include, but is not limited to, the following topics:

	 Personnel management, including best practices on hiring, recruitment, assignment, and retention of staff
	 
	 Effective fiscal management and accountability practices
	 
	 Academic standards and standards-aligned curriculum and instructional materials
	 
	 Leadership training to improve the academic achievement of all students, including capacity building in pedagogies of learning, instructional strategies that meet the varied learning needs of students, and student motivation
	 
	 The use of student assessments, including analysis of disaggregated assessment results to identify needs and progress of student subgroups
	 
	 The use of technology to improve student performance and district operations
	 
	 Creation of safe and inclusive school environments
	 
	 Parental involvement and community collaboration
	 
	 Employee relations
	 
	 Effective school and district planning processes

The district's staff evaluation process may be used to recommend additional staff development for individual employees.

The Superintendent or designee shall evaluate the benefit to staff and students of professional development activities.
