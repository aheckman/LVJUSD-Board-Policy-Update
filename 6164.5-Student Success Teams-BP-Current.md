## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy should be revised to reflect district practice.  Utilization of the student success team (SST) process is not required by state or federal law.  As such, this Board policy reflects best practices rather than legal requirements.The SST is an early intervention process that brings together parents/guardians, certificated and classified staff, administrators, and/or the student, as appropriate, to identify student needs and develop an improvement plan to address those needs.
The Governing Board encourages the collaboration of parents/guardians, certificated and classified staff, administrators, and/or the student, as appropriate, in evaluating the strengths and needs of students having academic, attendance, social, emotional, or behavioral difficulties and in identifying strategies and programs that may assist such students in maximizing their potential.  The Superintendent or designee shall establish student success teams (SST) as needed to address individual student needs.

The Superintendent or designee shall establish and maintain a process for initiating the referral of students to SSTs, which may include referral by district staff, parents/guardians, and/or agency representatives.  The Superintendent or designee may also establish and maintain a process for responding to SST referrals, which may include a determination by the district as to whether an SST shall be convened for an individual student.

Each SST may collect and analyze relevant student data, as appropriate.  The SST may also review the student's educational history, work samples, strengths and areas for growth, and identify available resources and strategies.

Each SST shall develop a plan to support the student which incorporates intervention strategies.  Such strategies may include changes in program placement or instructional methods, recommendation of supplemental educational services, parent involvement strategies, social, emotional and/or behavioral interventions, discipline, referrals to other agencies or resources, and/or other appropriate interventions.

The SST shall monitor the student's progress, evaluate the extent to which the recommended strategies have been implemented, make adjustments to the plan, and develop additional interventions as needed.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 56303, a student should be referred for special education instruction and services only after the resources of the regular education program have been considered and, where appropriate, utilized.  However, the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs Memorandum 11-07 emphasizes that districts have an obligation to ensure that evaluations of students suspected of having a disability are not delayed or denied because of the implementation of response to intervention strategies, such as the SST process.
The SST process shall not delay or deny a referral for evaluation for eligibility for special education, as may be required under state or federal law.

CSBA NOTE: Districts that have established multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS) may integrate SSTs into such frameworks.  The California Department of Education describes MTSS as an integrated, comprehensive framework for districts that focuses on common core state standards, core instruction, differentiated and student-centered learning, individualized student needs, and the alignment of systems necessary for academic, behavioral, and social success.  MTSS is connected to the eight state priorities in the local control and accountability plan, and encompasses inclusive academic instruction as reflected in the California state standards and frameworks, response to instruction and intervention, behavior instruction such as positive behavioral interventions and supports and restorative practices, and social-emotional learning.The following paragraph is optional and should be deleted by districts that do not have an established MTSS.
The Superintendent or designee may integrate SSTs into the district's multi-tiered system of support, including identification of students who need additional support, the level(s) of support, appropriate interventions, monitoring of progress, and whether the goal of intervention has been met.

To strengthen the effectiveness of SSTs, the Superintendent or designee may provide staff development in the identification of students who may need additional support, implementation of measurable and targeted interventions, and monitoring of progress and goal attainment.
