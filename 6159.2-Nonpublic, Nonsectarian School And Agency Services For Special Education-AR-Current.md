The master contract or individual services agreement may be terminated for cause if either party gives 20 days' notice.

Placement and Services

For any student to be placed in an NPS/A, the Superintendent or designee shall develop an individual services agreement based on the student's IEP.

	Evaluate the educational progress of each student placed in an NPS/A, including a review of state assessment results

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by elementary school districts.
Prior to the annual review of a student's IEP, the Superintendent or designee shall notify any high school district to which the student may transfer of the student's enrollment in an NPS/A.  (5 CCR 3069)

Out-of-State Placements

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 7572.55 and Welfare and Institutions Code 362.2 and 727.1 address the out-of-state placement of children who are seriously emotionally disturbed and/or wards of the court. Such placements may be made only after in-state alternatives have been considered and found not to meet the child's needs.

<br>
The master contract or individual services agreement may be terminated for cause if either party gives 20 days&#39; notice.
