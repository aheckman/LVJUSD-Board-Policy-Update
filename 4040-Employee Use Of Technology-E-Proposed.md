## Policy Content

ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT
AND RELEASE OF DISTRICT FROM LIABILITY (EMPLOYEES)

 

The Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District authorizes District employees to use District technology, as defined in Board Policy 4040 - Employee Use of Technology. The use of District technology is a privilege permitted at the District's discretion and is subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth in applicable board policies, administrative regulations, and this Acceptable Use Agreement. The District reserves the right to suspend access at any time, without notice, for any reason.

The District expects all employees to use technology responsibly in order to avoid potential problems and liability. The District may place reasonable restrictions on the sites, material, and/or information that employees may access through the system. However, the District shall not prevent or restrict access to an employee's mobile or other communications device(s) if there is a need to seek emergency assistance, assess the safety of a situation, or communicate with a person to confirm the person's safety.

The District makes no guarantee that the functions or services provided by or through the District will be without defect. In addition, the District is not responsible for financial obligations arising from unauthorized use, or misuse, of the system.

Each employee who is authorized to use District technology shall sign this Agreement, which indicates that the employee has read and understands this Agreement and Board Policy 4040 - Employee Use of Technology.

Employee Obligations and Responsibilities

Employees are expected to use District technology safely, responsibly, and primarily for work-related purposes and in accordance with the accompanying board policy and applicable copyright laws. Any incidental personal use of District technology shall not interfere with District business and operations, the work and productivity of any District employee, or the safety and security of District technology. The District is not responsible for any loss or damage incurred by an employee as a result of the employee's personal use of District technology.

The employee in whose name District technology is issued is responsible for its proper use at all times. Employees shall not share their assigned online services account information, passwords, or other information used for identification and authorization purposes, and shall use the system only under the account to which they have been assigned.

Employees shall not gain unauthorized access to the files or equipment of others, access electronic resources by using another person's name or electronic identification, or send anonymous electronic communications. Furthermore, employees shall not attempt to access any data, documents, emails, or programs in the District's system for which they do not have authorization.

Employees are prohibited from using District technology for improper purposes, including, but not limited to, use of District technology to:


	Access, post, display, create, or otherwise use material that is discriminatory, defamatory, obscene, sexually explicit, harassing, intimidating, threatening, or disruptive
	 
	Disclose or in any way cause to be disclosed confidential or sensitive District, employee, or student information without prior authorization from a supervisor, including sharing confidential information or personally identifiable information with an open artificial intelligence system
	 
	Engage in personal commercial or other for-profit activities without permission of the Superintendent or designee
	 
	Engage in unlawful use of District technology for political lobbying
	 
	Infringe on copyright, license, trademark, patent, or other intellectual property rights
	 
	Intentionally disrupt or harm District technology or other District operations (such as destroying District equipment, placing a virus on District computers, adding or removing a computer program without permission, changing settings on shared computers)
	 
	Install unauthorized software
	 
	Engage in or promote unethical practices or violate any law or board policy, administrative regulation, or District practice


Privacy

Since the use of District technology is intended for use in conducting District business, no employee should have any expectation of privacy in any use of District technology.

The District reserves the right to monitor and record all use of District technology, including, but not limited to, access to the Internet or social media, Internet searches, browsing history, use of artificial intelligence, communications sent or received from District technology, or other uses within the jurisdiction of the District. Such monitoring/recording may occur at any time without prior notice for any legal purposes including, but not limited to, record retention and distribution and/or investigation of improper, illegal, or prohibited activity. Employees should be aware that, in most instances, their use of District technology (such as web searches or emails) cannot be erased or deleted.

All passwords created for or used on any District technology are the sole property of the District. The creation or use of a password by an employee on District technology does not create a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Personally Owned Devices

If an employee uses a personally owned device to access District technology or conduct District business, the employee shall abide by all applicable board policies, administrative regulations, and this Agreement. Any such use of a personally owned device may subject the contents of the device and any communications sent or received on the device to disclosure pursuant to a lawful subpoena or public records request.

Records

Any electronically stored information generated or received by an employee which constitutes a District or student record shall be classified, retained, and destroyed in accordance with Board Policy/Administrative Regulation 3580 - District Records, Board Policy/Administrative Regulation 5125 - Student Records, or other applicable policies and regulations addressing the retention of District or student records.

Reporting

If an employee becomes aware of any security problem (including, but not limited to, a cyberattack, phishing, or any compromise of the confidentiality of any login or account information), or misuse of District technology, the employee shall immediately report such information to the Superintendent or designee.

Consequences for Violation

Violations of the law, board policy, or this Agreement may result in revocation of an employee's access to District technology and/or discipline, up to and including termination. In addition, violations of the law, board policy, or this agreement may be reported to law enforcement agencies as appropriate.
