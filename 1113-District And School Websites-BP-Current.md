## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that maintain their own website(s) and may be revised to reflect district practice. District strategies for effective use of websites may be incorporated into the district's comprehensive communications plan; see BP 1100 - Communication with the Public.
To enhance communication with students, parents/guardians, staff, and community members, the Governing Board encourages the Superintendent or designee to develop and maintain district and school websites. The use of district and school websites shall support the district's vision and goals and shall be coordinated with other district communications strategies.

Design Standards

The Superintendent or designee shall establish design standards for district and school websites in order to maintain a consistent identity, professional appearance, and ease of use.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Pursuant to Civil Code 1798.99.28-1798.99.40, businesses that provide online services, products, or features that are likely to be accessed by children are required to prioritize the best interests of students in designing such products or features, to ensure that children are not exposed to harmful or potentially harmful content, contact, or conduct. Though this law is not necessarily applicable to districts, it is good guidance for districts seeking to create a safe online space for students.
District design standards shall require an evaluation of products, features, and content accessible to students on district and school websites to prevent access to harmful or potentially harmful material.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 USC 12131-12134) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 705, 794; 34 CFR 104.1-104.39), districts have an obligation to provide an equal opportunity to individuals with disabilities to participate in and receive the benefits of the educational program, and must provide accommodations or modifications when necessary to ensure equal treatment.A U.S. Department of Justice technical assistance publication, "Accessibility of State and Local Government Websites to People with Disabilities," states that an agency with a website that is otherwise inaccessible to individuals with disabilities may meet its legal obligations by providing an alternative accessible way for them to use the programs or services (e.g., a staffed telephone information line), but points out that these alternatives are unlikely to provide an equal degree of access in terms of hours of operation or range of options and programs available. See the accompanying administrative regulation for accessibility guidelines.
The district's design standards shall address the accessibility of district and school websites to individuals with disabilities, including compatibility with commonly used assistive technologies.

Website Content

The Superintendent or designee shall develop content guidelines for district and school websites and assign staff to review and approve content prior to posting.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph ensures consistency of district policies regarding advertising and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Board policy pertaining to advertising in district and school publications, as specified in Board Policy 1325 - Advertising and Promotion, shall also apply to advertising on district and school websites.

Privacy Rights

CSBA NOTE: Business and Professions Code 22580-22582 prohibit an operator of a website from knowingly using, disclosing, compiling, or allowing a third party to use, disclose, or compile the personal information of a minor for the purpose of marketing or advertising specified types of products or services. Business and Professions Code 22584-22585 prohibit the operator of a website that provides services to K-12 students from selling or disclosing specified student information or knowingly using that student information to engage in targeted advertising to students or parents/guardians or to amass a profile about a student. Business and Professions Code 22586 provides a similar prohibition for the operator of a website used, designed, and marketed primarily for preschool or prekindergarten purposes from knowingly engaging in specified activities, including targeted advertising, selling, or disclosing a student's information, and using specified information to amass a profile about a student except in furtherance of preschool or prekindergarten purposes. See BP 5125 - Student Records for further information regarding protection of student information.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the privacy rights of students, parents/guardians, staff, Board members, and other individuals are protected on district and school websites.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. The district should carefully consider whether to place personally identifiable information on district or school websites since release of such information may put individuals, including students, at risk and also may violate Education Code 49073, which prohibits disclosure of student directory information to any private profit-making entity; see BP/AR/E(1) 5125.1 - Release of Directory Information.
Telephone numbers and home and email addresses of students and/or their parents/guardians shall not be published on district or school websites.

CSBA NOTE: The following options address the use of students' photographs on district or school websites. Option 1 is for use by districts that, pursuant to Education Code 49061 and 34 CFR 99.3, include photographs in the definition of directory information, as specified in AR 5125.1 - Release of Directory Information, and publish student photographs along with student names unless a parent/guardian requested in writing that no photographs of the child be released without prior written consent. Option 2 is for use by districts that do not allow student photographs to be published along with student names unless specific consent for such publication is received from the parent/guardian.
OPTION 1:  The district regards photographs as a category of directory information that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Therefore, a student's photograph, together with the student's name, may be published on district or school websites unless the student's parent/guardian has notified the district in writing to not release the student's photograph without prior written consent, in accordance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 5125.1 - Release of Directory Information.
END OF OPTION 1

OPTION 2:  Photographs of individual students shall not be published on district or school websites accompanied by the student's name or other personally identifiable information without the prior written consent of the student's parent/guardian.
END OF OPTION 2

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this policy is for use by all districts.
If students' names are not included, photographs of individual students or groups of students, such as at a school event, may be published on school or district websites.

CSBA NOTE: Posting of employees' home addresses, personal telephone numbers, or personal email addresses on district or school websites is prohibited by law in certain circumstances in order to maintain employee privacy and safety. See BP 1340 - Access to District Records, AR 3580 - District Records, and BB 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications.
Employees' home addresses, personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses shall not be posted on district or school websites.

The home address or telephone number of any elected or appointed official including, but not limited to, a Board member or public safety official, shall not be posted on district or school websites without the prior written permission of that individual.  (Government Code 3307.5, 7928.205, 7920.535)

No public safety official shall be required to consent to the posting on the Internet of the public safety official's photograph or identity as a public safety officer for any purpose if that officer reasonably believes that the disclosure may result in a threat, harassment, intimidation, or harm to the officer or the officer's family.  (Government Code 3307.5)
