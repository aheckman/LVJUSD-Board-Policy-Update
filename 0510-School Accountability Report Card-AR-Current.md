CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation includes a non-exhaustive list of the components which the law explicitly requires be included in each school site's school accountability report card (SARC) and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Each year the principal or designee at each school shall prepare a school accountability report card (SARC), which shall include, but is not limited to:  (Education Code 33126)

	Student achievement by grade level, as measured by the results of the statewide assessment
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6311, a district that receives Title I Funds is required to include high school graduation rates, including a four-year adjusted cohort graduate rate, on its annual report card. The California Department of Education monitors district programs and operations for compliance with these requirements through its Federal Program Monitoring (FPM) process. The FPM process includes a review of a district's written policies and procedures to maintain required documentation for students who transfer or withdraw from a district school, including the exit reasons and documentation to support the exit reasons.
	Progress toward reducing dropout rates, including the one-year dropout rate listed in the California Basic Educational Data System (CBEDS) for the school over the most recent three-year period, and the graduation rate, as defined by the State Board of Education, over the most recent three-year period when available pursuant to Education Code 52052
	 
	Estimated expenditures per student and types of services funded, including the actual salaries of personnel assigned to the school
	
	The assessment of estimated expenditures per student shall be reported in total, in subtotal by restricted and by unrestricted source, and include a reporting of the average of actual salaries paid to certificated instructional personnel at that school.
	 
	Progress toward reducing class sizes and teaching loads, including the average class size and the distribution of class sizes at the school by grade level, using CBEDS for the most recent three-year period
	 
	The total number of the school's fully credentialed teachers, the number of teachers relying upon emergency credentials, the number of teachers working without credentials, any assignment of teachers outside their subject areas of competence, misassignments, including misassignments of teachers of English learners, and the number of vacant teacher positions for the most recent three-year period
	 
	The quality and currency of textbooks and other instructional materials, including whether textbooks and other materials meet state standards, the ratio of textbooks per student, and the year the textbooks were adopted
	 
	The availability of sufficient textbooks and other instructional materials, as determined pursuant to Education Code 60119, for each student, including English learners, in each of the areas of the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science, and history/social science; world language and health; science laboratory equipment for grades 9 to 12, inclusive, as appropriate; and visual and performing arts
	
	If the Governing Board determines, pursuant to Education Code 60119, that there are insufficient textbooks or instructional materials, or both, it shall include information for each school in which an insufficiency exists, identifying the percentage of students who lack sufficient standards-aligned textbooks or instructional materials in each subject area identified above.
	 
	The availability of qualified personnel to provide counseling and other student support services, including the ratio of academic counselors per student
	 
	Safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of school facilities, including any needed maintenance to ensure good repair
	 
	The annual number of school days dedicated to staff development for the most recent three-year period
	 
	Suspension and expulsion rates for the most recent three-year period
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 33126 requires schools to include the Academic Performance Index (API) in each SARC. However, the API was replaced in 2017 with the new accountability and continuous improvement system known as the California School Dashboard.Additionally, pursuant to Education Code 33126, the data in the SARC is required to be disaggregated for each numerically significant subgroup, as defined in Education Code 52052, which, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), includes "long-term English learners." Pursuant to Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), a "long-term English learner" is defined as a student who has not attained English language proficiency within seven years of initial classification as an English learner.
	The Academic Performance Index, which is reflected in the California School Dashboard, including the disaggregation of student subgroups identified in Education Code 52052, the decile rankings, and a comparison of schools
	 
	Contact information for organized opportunities for parent/guardian involvement
	
	CSBA NOTE: The following two criteria apply to schools serving students in grades 9-12.
	For secondary schools, the percentage of graduates who have passed course requirements for entrance to the University of California and the California State University, including the course requirements for high school graduation pursuant to Education Code 51225.3, and the percentage of students enrolled in those courses, as reported by CBEDS
	 
	The number of advanced placement courses offered, by subject
	 
	Career technical education (CTE) data measures, including:
	 
	
		A list of programs offered by the district that students at the school may participate in and are aligned to the model curriculum standards adopted pursuant to Education Code 51226 and program sequences offered by the district
		
		The list shall identify which courses are conducted by a regional occupational center or program and those that are conducted directly by the district.
		 
		A list of the district's primary representative of the CTE advisory committee and the industries represented
		 
		The number of students participating in CTE
		 
		The percentage of students that complete a CTE program and earn a high school diploma
		 
		The percentage of CTE courses that are sequenced or articulated between a school and postsecondary education schools
	
	

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 41409.3, the following requirements do not apply to single school districts and should be deleted by such districts.
Additionally, each SARC shall also include the following information:  (Education Code 41409.3)

	The beginning, median, and highest salary paid to teachers in the district, as reflected in the district's salary scale
	 
	The average salary for school-site principals in the district
	 
	The salary of the Superintendent
	 
	The percentage expended for the salaries of administrative personnel, as specified
