## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 38133 mandates the Governing Board to develop rules and regulations related to the management, direction, and control of school facilities. Pursuant to Education Code 38130-38138 (the Civic Center Act), school facilities are civic centers and, under certain circumstances, members of the school community must be allowed to use them for specified purposes. In granting access for the use of school facilities to district residents and community groups, the Board must be careful to avoid discriminating against certain individuals, groups, or viewpoints and thereby violating constitutional requirements, including free speech rights. In Good News Club v. Milford Central School, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the school district violated the club's free speech rights when it denied the club's use of school facilities for after-school meetings because of the religious nature of the meetings.
The Governing Board believes that school facilities and grounds are a vital community resource which should be used to foster community involvement and development. Therefore, the Board authorizes the use of school facilities by district residents and community groups for purposes specified in the Civic Center Act, to the extent that such use does not interfere with school activities or other school-related uses.

The Superintendent or designee shall give priority to school-related activities in the use of school facilities and grounds. Other uses authorized under the Civic Center Act shall be on a first-come, first-served basis.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 38133, the Board is mandated to develop rules and regulations which must include the items specified below for the management, direction, and control of school facilities.
For the effective management and control of school facilities and grounds, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain procedures and regulations that:  (Education Code 38133)

	Aid, encourage, and assist groups desiring to use school facilities for approved activities
	 
	Preserve order in school facilities and on school grounds and protect school facilities, including the designation of a person to supervise this task, if necessary
	 
	Ensure that the use of school facilities or grounds is not inconsistent with their use for school purposes and does not interfere with the regular conduct of schoolwork

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional and may be modified to reflect district practice.
Subject to prior approval by the Board, the Superintendent or designee may grant the use of school facilities or grounds on those days on which district schools are closed.  (Education Code 37220)

There shall be no advertising on school facilities and grounds except as specified in Board Policy 1325 - Advertising and Promotion.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be modified to reflect district practice. A district may enter into an agreement with another entity for the joint use of school facilities or grounds. For considerations to guide the development of such an agreement, see BP 1330.1 - Joint Use Agreements.
As necessary to ensure efficient use of school facilities, the Superintendent or designee may, with the Board's approval, enter into an agreement for the joint use of any school facilities or grounds. The Board shall approve any such agreement only if it determines that it is in the best interest of the district and the community.

Fees

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 38134 authorizes districts to charge an amount "not to exceed" direct costs for the use of school facilities or grounds by community groups and entities. 5 CCR 14037-14041 contain specific rules adopted by the State Board of Education for determining "direct costs" to be charged for use of school facilities and grounds. See the section "Calculating Direct Costs" below. If the district chooses to charge fees, 5 CCR 14041 requires the Board to adopt a fee schedule that specifies the hourly fee to be charged by the district either for specific school facilities and grounds or for types or categories of school facilities or grounds (e.g., all gymnasiums or playgrounds).
The Board shall adopt a comprehensive schedule of fees to be charged for community use of school facilities and grounds, including, but not limited to, the multipurpose room(s), playing or athletic field(s), track and field venue(s), tennis court(s), and outdoor basketball court(s). The schedule of fees shall be prepared in accordance with 5 CCR 14037-14041.  (5 CCR 14041)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 38134 mandates each district that chooses to charge the community a fee for the use of school facilities to adopt a policy specifying the activities and organizations that shall be subjected to the fees.The options below provide suggestions on how districts that choose to charge fees may categorize activities and organizations for that purpose. Option 1 is for use by districts that choose to charge an amount "not to exceed" direct costs to all community groups. Option 2 is for use by districts that choose to grant free use to nonprofit organizations and to groups organized to promote youth and school activities but charge other groups an amount "not to exceed" direct costs. Option 3 is for use by districts that grant free use to school-related organizations only.Regardless of the option chosen, there is an exception for the use of school facilities and grounds for religious services, as noted below.
OPTION 1:  (Amount not to exceed direct costs to all community groups)

The Board believes that the use of school facilities or grounds should not result in an expense to the district. The Superintendent or designee shall charge all groups granted the use of school facilities or grounds under the Civic Center Act an amount not to exceed direct costs determined in accordance with 5 CCR 14037-14041.  (Education Code 38134)
OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (No charge to nonprofit organizations and youth and school-oriented groups)

CSBA NOTE: This option reflects the common practice among districts to allow free use of school facilities by nonprofit organizations and clubs and associations that promote youth and school activities pursuant to Education Code 38134. Districts that wish to allow free use by some groups but charge other groups should proceed cautiously and ensure that such free use or discount is granted on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis. It is strongly recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel before deciding which groups will or will not be charged and, based upon legal counsel's advice, decide whether it would be appropriate to specifically name in the district's policy the community groups that will or will not be charged.
The Board authorizes the use of school facilities or grounds, without charge, by nonprofit organizations and by clubs or associations organized to promote youth and school activities, including, but not limited to, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Camp Fire USA, YMCA, parent-teacher associations, school-community advisory councils, and recreational youth sports leagues that charge participants no more than an average of $60 per month. Other groups that request the use of school facilities under the Civic Center Act shall be charged an amount not to exceed direct costs determined in accordance with 5 CCR 14037-14041.  (Education Code 38134)
OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

OPTION 3:  (No charge to school-related organizations)

The Board authorizes the use of school facilities or grounds without charge to school-related organizations whose activities are directly related to or for the benefit of district schools. All other groups requesting the use of school facilities under the Civic Center Act shall be charged an amount not to exceed direct costs determined in accordance with 5 CCR 14037-14041.
OPTION 3 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section is for use by all districts regardless of the option chosen above.Pursuant to Education Code 38134, a district must charge "at least" direct costs to any group using school facilities for religious services even if the district selects Option 2 or Option 3 above and does not charge other groups. However, this may conflict with the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Good News Club v. Milford Central School, which held that a district's refusal to let a Christian club hold after-school meetings because of its religious nature, while permitting other secular character-building clubs to meet, constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment. Due to the potential conflict between this case and state law, districts should take caution in selecting Option 2 or Option 3 above or adopting a policy that charges religious groups direct costs when those costs are not charged to other groups. Districts are advised to consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel with questions about charging religious groups for use of district facilities.
Additionally, when any use of school facilities or grounds is for religious services, the district shall charge an amount at least equal to the district's direct costs.  (Education Code 38134)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 38134 requires the district to charge fair rental value when facilities are used for fundraising activities which are not beneficial to youth, public school activities, or charitable purposes, under the conditions specified below. "Fair rental value" is defined as direct costs plus the amortized costs of the school facilities or grounds used for the duration of the activity.
Groups shall be charged fair rental value when using school facilities or grounds for entertainment or meetings where admission is charged or contributions solicited and net receipts are not to be expended for charitable purposes or for the welfare of the district's students.  (Education Code 38134)

Calculating Direct Costs

Direct costs to be charged for community use of each, or each type of, school facility or grounds shall be calculated in accordance with 5 CCR 14038 and may reflect the community's proportionate share of the following costs:  (Education Code 38134; 5 CCR 14038-14041)

	Capital direct costs calculated in accordance with 5 CCR 14039, including the estimated costs of maintenance, repair, restoration, and refurbishment of non-classroom space school facilities or grounds
	 
	Operational direct costs calculated in accordance with 5 CCR 14040, including estimated costs of supplies, utilities, janitorial services, other services performed by district employees and/or contracted workers, and salaries and benefits paid to district employees directly associated with the administration of the Civic Center Act to operate and maintain school facilities and grounds

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph applies to districts that choose to discount direct cost fees based on the type or category of the applicant, such as to groups with tax-exempt status as authorized pursuant to 5 CCR 14041.
Direct cost fees shall not be discounted to any group or organization except when the discount is specifically authorized in the adopted fee schedule.  (5 CCR 14041)

Expending Funds Collected as Capital Direct Costs

Any funds collected as capital direct costs shall be deposited into a special fund to be used only for capital maintenance, repair, restoration, and refurbishment of school facilities and grounds.  (5 CCR 14042)

Use of School Facility as Polling Place

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Elections Code 12283, an elections official requesting the use of a school building as a polling place or vote center must include in the request a list of the schools needed. Such requests must be made within sufficient time before the start of the school year so that the Board can determine and notify parents/guardians whether (1) the school will remain in session on those days, (2) the school day will be designated for staff training and development, or (3) the school will be closed to students and nonclassified employees. See BP 6111 - School Calendar.
The Board may authorize the use of school buildings as polling places, or vote centers for election day. The Board may also authorize the use of school buildings, without cost, for the storage of voting machines and other vote-tabulating devices. However, if a city or county elections official specifically requests the use of a school building as a polling place, or vote center on election day and/or during the 10 days preceding election day, as well as during key dates necessary for drop-off, set-up, and pick-up of election materials, as determined by the elections official, the Board shall allow its use for such purpose. If school will be in session, the Superintendent or designee shall identify to elections officials the specific areas of the school buildings not occupied by school activities that will be allowed for use as a polling place or vote center.  (Elections Code 12283)

When a school is used as a polling place or vote center, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the elections official a site with an adequate amount of space that will allow the precinct board to perform its duties in a manner that will not impede, interfere, or interrupt the normal process of voting and shall make a telephone line for Internet access available for use by local elections officials if so requested. The Superintendent or designee shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that the site is accessible to persons with disabilities.  (Elections Code 12283)

The Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures to ensure student safety and minimize disruptions whenever school is in session while the facilities are being used as a polling place or vote center.

<div id='QMg694' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section is for use by all districts regardless of the option chosen above.<br><br>Pursuant to Education Code 38134, a district must charge "at least" direct costs to any group using school facilities for religious services even if the district selects Option 2 or Option 3 above and does not charge other groups. However, this may conflict with the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Good News Club v. Milford Central School, which held that a district's refusal to let a Christian club hold after-school meetings because of its religious nature, while permitting other secular character-building clubs to meet, constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment. Due to the potential conflict between this case and state law, districts should take caution in selecting Option 2 or Option 3 above or adopting a policy that charges religious groups direct costs when those costs are not charged to other groups. Districts are advised to consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel with questions about charging religious groups for use of district facilities.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MjIzMA7" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MjIzMA7%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22QMg694%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1694469975%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20remainder%20of%20this%20section%20is%20for%20use%20by%20all%20districts%20regardless%20of%20the%20option%20chosen%20above.%5Cn%5CnPursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%2038134%2C%20a%20district%20must%20charge%20%5C%22at%20least%5C%22%20direct%20costs%20to%20any%20group%20using%20school%20facilities%20for%20religious%20services%20even%20if%20the%20district%20selects%20Option%202%20or%20Option%203%20above%20and%20does%20not%20charge%20other%20groups.%20However%2C%20this%20may%20conflict%20with%20the%20U.S.%20Supreme%20Court%27s%20ruling%20in%20Good%20News%20Club%20v.%20Milford%20Central%20School%2C%20which%20held%20that%20a%20district%27s%20refusal%20to%20let%20a%20Christian%20club%20hold%20after-school%20meetings%20because%20of%20its%20religious%20nature%2C%20while%20permitting%20other%20secular%20character-building%20clubs%20to%20meet%2C%20constituted%20impermissible%20viewpoint%20discrimination%20under%20the%20First%20Amendment.%20Due%20to%20the%20potential%20conflict%20between%20this%20case%20and%20state%20law%2C%20districts%20should%20take%20caution%20in%20selecting%20Option%202%20or%20Option%203%20above%20or%20adopting%20a%20policy%20that%20charges%20religious%20groups%20direct%20costs%20when%20those%20costs%20are%20not%20charged%20to%20other%20groups.%20Districts%20are%20advised%20to%20consult%20with%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel%20with%20questions%20about%20charging%20religious%20groups%20for%20use%20of%20district%20facilities.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MjIzMA7" title="CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section is for us..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
