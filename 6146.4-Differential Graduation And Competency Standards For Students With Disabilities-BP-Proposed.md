## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that students with disabilities are entitled to a course of study that provides them with a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and that modifications to the District's regular course may be needed on an individualized basis to provide FAPE. In accordance with law, each student's individualized education program (IEP) team shall determine the appropriate goals, as well as any appropriate individual accommodations necessary for measuring the academic achievement and functional performance of the student on state and Districtwide assessments.

Exemption from District-Established Graduation Requirements 

District students shall complete all course requirements for high school graduation as specified in Board Policy 6146.1 - High School Graduation Requirements. However, and except as otherwise set forth in Education Code section 51225.32 (b), a student with a disability that entered the ninth grade in the 2022-23 school year and later may be exempted from all coursework and other requirements adopted by the Board that are in addition to the statewide course requirements for high school graduation if the student's IEP provides for both of the following requirements: (Education Code 51225.31).

	That the student is eligible to take the alternate assessment as described in Education Code 60640; and
	 
	That the student complete state standards aligned coursework to meet the statewide coursework specified in Education Code 51225.3

Any such exempted student shall receive a state defined alternate diploma and be eligible to participate in any graduation ceremony and school activity related to graduation in which a student of similar age without a disability would be eligible to participate. (Education Code 51225.31)

Participation in graduation activities shall not be construed as termination of the provision of free appropriate public education, consistent with section 300.102(a)(3)(ii) of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations. (Education code 51225.31)

Certificate of Educational Achievement 

Instead of a high school diploma, a student with disabilities may be awarded a certificate or document of educational achievement or completion if the student has met one of the following requirements: (Education Code 56390)

	Satisfactorily completed a prescribed alternative course of study approved by the Board of the District in which the student attended school or the District with jurisdiction over the student as identified in the student’s IEP
	 
	Satisfactorily met the student’s IEP goals and objectives during high school as determined by the IEP team
	 
	Satisfactorily attended high school, participated in the instruction as prescribed in the student’s IEP, and met the objectives of the statement of transition services

A student with disabilities who meets any of the criteria specified above shall be eligible to participate in any graduation ceremony and any school activity related to graduation in which a graduating student of similar age without disabilities would be eligible to participate. (Education Code 56391)
