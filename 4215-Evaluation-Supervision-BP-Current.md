## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes that appropriate supervision and regular, comprehensive evaluations can help employees to continually improve in the performance of their responsibilities.  Evaluations shall be made in accordance with procedures specified in negotiated contracts and based on job-specific standards of performance.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3543.2, procedures to be used for the evaluation of employees are conditions of employment subject to negotiation. Performance standards used as the basis for the evaluations are not mandatory subjects of negotiation.  The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Board expects supervisors to gauge employees' on-the-job effectiveness and skills in a fair, objective, and consistent manner.  Evaluations shall address the competence and care with which the employee executes his/her assigned responsibilities.  As appropriate, evaluations also may address the extent to which the employee works cooperatively with others and observes school or district rules and regulations.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that evaluation ratings have uniform meaning throughout the district.

Evaluations shall be used to recognize the exemplary skills and accomplishments of staff and to identify areas needing improvement. When the evaluation indicates areas needing improvement, the Board expects employees to accept responsibility and take initiative to improve their performance. The Superintendent or designee shall assist employees in obtaining needed job skills.

The evaluation shall be dated and signed by both the employee and the supervisor.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. For districts incorporating the merit system, Education Code 45262 requires that the rules and procedures of the personnel commission, which include procedures pertaining to performance evaluations pursuant to Education Code 45261, be made available as specified.  AB 1772 (Ch. 547, Statutes of 2005) amended Education Code 45262 to authorize districts to publish and distribute these rules by electronic means.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that classified employees have access to rules and procedures related to performance evaluations.
