## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 41010 and 42600 require districts to expend funds in accordance with the classification of expenditures included in their adopted budget and in the "California School Accounting Manual." However, in certain limited circumstances, the Governing Board may approve interfund borrowing or the transfer of money between funds. The following policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board recognizes its responsibility to monitor the district's fiscal practices to ensure accountability regarding the expenditure of public funds and compliance with legal requirements.

The total amount budgeted by the district for each major classification of expenditures, as listed in the California Department of Education's budget forms, shall be the maximum amount which the district may expend for that classification for the school year.  (Education Code 42600)

However, when it is in the best interest of the district, the Board may: 

	At any time, adopt a written resolution providing for transfers from the designated fund balance or the unappropriated fund balance to any expenditure classification or between classifications.  The resolution shall be filed with the County Superintendent of Schools and the County Auditor.  (Education Code 42600)
	 
	Direct the temporary transfer of monies held in any district fund or account to another fund or account as necessary for the payment of obligations. Such borrowing shall occur only when the fund or account receiving the money will earn sufficient income during the current fiscal year to repay the amount transferred.  No more than 75 percent of the maximum amount held in any fund or account during the current fiscal year may be transferred.  Amounts transferred shall be repaid in the same fiscal year, or in the following fiscal year if the transfer takes place within the final 120 calendar days of a fiscal year.  (Education Code 42603)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 42601, the district, with the approval of the Board, may identify and request that the County Superintendent of Schools make transfers at the close of a school year in order to permit the payment of district obligations incurred during that school year, as provided in item #3 below. For elementary school districts with average daily attendance (ADA) of 900 or less, high school districts with ADA of 300 or less, or unified districts with ADA of 1,500 or less, the County Superintendent may identify and make the transfers, with the consent of the Board.
	At the close of a school year, request that the County Superintendent make transfers between the designated fund balance or the unappropriated fund balance and any expenditure classification(s), or balance any expenditure classifications of the district budget as necessary for the payment of obligations incurred during that school year.  (Education Code 42601)
	 
	 If any special reserve funds that are maintained for capital outlay or other purposes pursuant to Education Code 42842 are not actually encumbered for ongoing expenses, transfer those monies into the general fund for the general operating purposes of the district.  If any monies remain in the special reserve fund at the conclusion of a project, the Board may submit a written request to the County Superintendent, Auditor, and Treasurer to discontinue the special reserve fund and transfer those monies to the district's general fund.  (Education Code 42841-42843)
	 
	 Transfer monies between other funds or accounts when authorized by law.
