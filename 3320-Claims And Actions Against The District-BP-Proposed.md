Within the time limits provided in "Time Limitations" above or prior to final action by the Board, whichever is later, a claim may be amended if, as amended, it relates to the same transaction or occurrence which gave rise to the original claim.  (Government Code 910.6)

Late Claims

When a claim that is required to be presented not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action, as specified in "Time Limitations" above, is not presented within that time, an application to present a late claim may be presented to the Board, in the manner specified in Government Code 915 and 915.2, within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of action. The application shall include the proposed claim and shall state the reason for the delay in presenting the claim.  (Government Code 911.4)

If the claim is presented late and is not accompanied by an application to present a late claim, the Board or its designee shall, within 45 days, give written notice, in the manner specified in Government Code 911.3, that the claim was not presented timely and that it is being returned without further action.  (Government Code 911.3)

The Board shall grant or deny the application to present a late claim within 45 days after it is presented. This 45-day period may be extended by written agreement of the claimant and the Board provided that such agreement is made before the expiration of the 45-day period.  (Government Code 911.6)

The Board shall grant the application to present a late claim where one or more of the following conditions are applicable:  (Government Code 911.6)

	The failure to present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect and the District was not prejudiced in its defense regarding the claim by the claimant's failure to present the claim within the time limit
	 
	The person who sustained the alleged injury, damage, or loss was a minor during all of the time specified for presentation of the claim
	 
	The person who sustained the alleged injury, damage, or loss was physically or mentally incapacitated during all of the time specified for presentation of the claim and the disability was the reason the person failed to present the claim
	 
	The person who sustained the alleged injury, damage, or loss died before the expiration of the time specified for the presentation of the claim

If the application to present a late claim is denied, the claimant shall be given notice in substantially the same form as set forth in Government Code 911.8 and in the manner specified in Government Code 915.4.

If the Board does not take action on the application to present a late claim within 45 days, the application shall be deemed to have been denied on the 45th day unless the time period has been extended, in which case it shall be denied on the last day of the period specified in the extension agreement.  (Government Code 911.6)

Action on Claims

Within 45 days after the presentation or amendment of a claim, the Board shall take action on the claim. This time limit may be extended by written agreement between the District and the claimant before the expiration of the 45-day period. If the 45-day period has expired, the time limit may be extended if legal action has not commenced or been barred by legal limitations.  (Government Code 912.4)

The Board may act on the claim in one of the following ways:  (Government Code 912.4, 912.6)

	If the Board finds that the claim is not a proper charge against the District, the claim shall be rejected
	 
	If the Board finds that the claim is a proper charge against the District and is for an amount justly due, the claim shall be allowed
	 
	If the Board finds that the claim is a proper charge against the District but is for an amount greater than is justly due, the Board shall either reject the claim or allow it in the amount justly due and reject it as to the balance
	 
	If legal liability of the District or the amount justly due is disputed, the Board may reject or compromise the claim
	 
	If the Board takes no action on the claim, the claim shall be deemed rejected

In accordance with Government Code 935.4, the Board delegates to the Superintendent the authority to allow, compromise, or settle claims of $50,000 or less pursuant to any conditions of coverage in the District's JPA agreement or insurance coverage.

If the Board, or Superintendent when appropriate, allows the claim, in whole or in part, or compromises the claim and the claimant accepts the amount allowed or offered to settle the claim, the Board may require the claimant to accept it in settlement of the entire claim.  (Government Code 912.6)

The Board or its designee shall transmit to the claimant written notice of action taken or of inaction which is deemed rejection. The notice shall be in the form set forth in Government Code 913 and shall be provided in the manner specified in Government Code 915.4.  (Government Code 913)

Registry of Public Agencies

Within 10 days of any change in the full, legal name of the District, the mailing address of the Board, or the names, titles, and addresses of the Board president, the Board clerk or secretary, or other Board members, the Superintendent or designee shall file the updated information with the Secretary of State and the County Clerk.  (Government Code 53051)
