## Policy Content

The Board of Education shall annually conduct a self-evaluation in order to demonstrate accountability to the community and ensure that District governance effectively supports student achievement and the attainment of the District's vision and goals.

The evaluation may address any area of Board responsibility, including, but not limited to, Board performance in relation to vision setting, curriculum, personnel, finance, policy development, collective bargaining, community relations, and advocacy. The evaluation may also address objectives related to Board meeting operations, relationships among Board members, relationship with the Superintendent, understanding of Board and Superintendent roles and responsibilities, communication skills, or other governance or boardsmanship skills.

The Board shall evaluate itself as a whole. Individual Board members are also expected to use the evaluation process as an opportunity to assess and set goals for their own personal performance.

Each year, the Board, with assistance from the Superintendent, shall determine an evaluation method or instrument that measures key components of board responsibility and previously identified performance objectives. Visual and/or audio recordings of a Board meeting may only be used as an evaluation tool when consent is given by all Board members.

Any discussion involving the Board's self-evaluation shall be conducted in open session.

At the request of the Board, a facilitator may be used to assist with the evaluation process. The Board may invite the Superintendent or other individual(s) with pertinent information to provide input into the evaluation process.

Following the evaluation, the Board shall set goals, define and/or refine protocols, and establish priorities and objectives for the following year's evaluation. The Board shall also develop strategies for strengthening Board performance based on identified areas of need, including, but not limited to, Board trainings such as those offered by the California School Boards Association.
