Definitions





Chronic absentee means a student who is absent for any reason on 10 percent or more of the school days in the school year, when the total number of days the student is absent is divided by the total number of days the student is enrolled and school was actually taught in the regular schools of the District, exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays. (Education Code 60901)

Truant means a student who is absent from school without a valid excuse three full days in one school year, or tardy or absent for more than any 30-minute period during the school day without a valid excuse on three occasions in one school year, or any combination thereof. (Education Code 48260)

Habitual truant means a student who has been reported as truant three or more times within the same school year, provided the District has made a conscientious effort to hold at least one conference with the student and his/her parent/guardian. (Education Code 48262, 48264.5)

Chronic truant means a student who has been absent from school without a valid excuse for 10 percent or more of the school days in one school year, from the date of enrollment to the current date, provided the District has met the requirements of Education Code 48260-48263 and 48291. (Education Code 48263.6)

For purposes of classifying a student as truant, valid excuse includes, but is not limited to, the reasons for which a student shall be excused from school pursuant to Education Code 48205, 48225.5 and Administrative Regulation 5113 - Absences and Excuses. A valid excuse also may include other reasons that are within the discretion of school administrators and, based on the facts of the student's circumstances, are deemed to constitute a valid excuse. (Education Code 48260)

Addressing Chronic Absence

When a student is identified as a chronic absentee, the Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall communicate with the student and student's parents/guardians to determine the reason(s) for the excessive absences, ensure the student and parents/guardians are aware of the adverse consequences of poor attendance, and jointly develop a plan for improving the student's school attendance.

When necessary, the student may be referred to a School Attendance Review Team (SART) or School Attendance Review Board (SARB) program, a truancy mediation program established by the County Office of Education, or a comparable program deemed acceptable by the Superintendent or designee, in accordance with Education Code 48263 and Item #3 in "Addressing Truancy" below.

A student who is struggling academically may be offered tutoring, if available, or other supplemental instruction, extended learning opportunities, and/or alternative educational options as appropriate.

Students who are absent shall be given an opportunity to make up missed assignments or assessments and shall receive full credit for satisfactory completion of the work. Students with excessive absences shall be supported to the extent possible to limit the impact of absences on the student's grades.

Whenever chronic absenteeism is linked to a health, social-emotional, family, or other or non-school issue, the Superintendent or designer may recommend a school or community resources and/or collaborate with community agencies and organizations to address the needs of the student and the student's family.

Addressing Truancy

The Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall investigate a complaint from any person that a parent/guardian has violated the state compulsory education laws contained in Education Code 48200-48341. (Education Code 48290)

When a student has been identified as truant as defined above, the following steps shall be implemented based on the number of truancies he/she has committed:


	Initial truancy
	 
	
		The student shall be reported to the Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee. (Education Code 48260)
		 
		The student's parent/guardian shall be notified by the most cost-effective method possible, which may include email or a telephone call, that: (Education Code 48260.5)
		 
		
			The student is truant.
			 
			Alternative educational programs are available in the District.
			 
			The parent/guardian has the right to meet with appropriate school personnel to discuss solutions to the student's truancy.
			 
			The parent/guardian is obligated to compel the student to attend school.
			 
			Mental health and supportive services may be available to the student and the family.
			 
			School personnel are available to meet with the student and family to develop strategies to support the student's attendance at school
			 
			Research shows that missing 10 percent of school for any reason can translate into students having difficulty learning to read by third grade, achieving in middle school, and graduating from high school 
			 
		
		
		The student and, as appropriate, student's parent/guardian may be requested to attend a meeting with a Child Welfare & Attendance Specialist (CWA), school counselor, or other school designees, to discuss the root causes of the attendance issue and develop a joint plan to improve the student's attendance. (Education Code 48264.5)
		​​​​​​​
	
	
	Second truancy
	​​​​​​​
	
		Any student who has once been reported as truant shall again be reported to the Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee as truant if the student is absent from school without a valid excuse one or more days, or is tardy on one or more days during the school year. (Education Code 48261)
		 
		An appropriate District staff member shall make a conscientious effort to hold at least one conference with the student and the student's parent/guardian by communicating with the parent/guardian at least once using the most cost-effective method possible, which may include email or a telephone call. This step may occursprior to holding a SART (Student Attendance Review Team) meeting. (Education Code 48262)
		 
		The student/parent may be given a verbal, written, or electronic notice for referral to a SART meeting by a Child Welfare and Attendance Specialist or District designee. A record of that warning may be kept at the school for not less than one year or until the student graduates or transfers from the school. If the student transfers, the record will be forwarded to the new school. (Education Code 48264.5)3.
		 
	
	
	Third truancy (habitual truancy)
	​​​​​​​
	
		A student who is habitually truant, a chronic absentee, or habitually insubordinate or disorderly during attendance at school may be referred to, and required to attend, a School Attendance Review Board (SARB) program, a truancy mediation program established by the District or a comparable program deemed acceptable by the Superintendent or designee. (Education Code 48263, 48264.5)
		 
		Upon making a referral to the SARB, the Superintenent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall provide the student and parent/guardian, in writing, the name and address of the SARB or probation department and the reason for the referral. This notice shall indicate that the student and parent/guardian shall be required, along with the District staff person making the referral, to meet with the SARB to consider a proper disposition of the referral. (Education Code 48263)
		 
		If the student does not successfully complete the truancy mediation program or another similar program, the student shall be subject to a SARB reconvene or referral to the County Office of Education.

The Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall maintain accurate attendance records for students identified as habitual or chronic truants. In addition, the attendance supervisor or designee  and/or the staff persons who have direct contacts with the student and parent/guardian shall document all their contacts regarding the student's attendance, including a summary of all conversations and a record of all intervention efforts.
