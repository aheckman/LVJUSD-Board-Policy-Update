## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board desires to provide a comprehensive, research-based curriculum in a supportive, positive, and engaging manner that motivates every student to succeed. The district's educational program shall provide students with rigorous opportunities to attain the academic, social and emotional skills, knowledge, and abilities they need to be successful in school, postsecondary education and/or employment, and develop to their full potential.

Strategies for improving the educational program shall take into consideration the needs of individual students and subpopulations of students, including, but not limited to, social, emotional, and behavioral needs. Students who are failing or at risk of failing to meet academic standards shall be provided with alternative programs and/or supplemental assistance designed to raise achievement.

Parents/guardians are critical partners in their children's education and shall be provided with opportunities to be meaningfully involved both in support of their children's education program at school and with learning at home.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph includes concepts from the California Department of Education's 2023 publication, "California State Plan for Career Technical Education: A Vision for Equity and Excellence in CTE."
The district's goal of student success may be achieved through regional coordination, collaboration, and alignment between the school, parents/guardians, and the community, including district support for innovative programs and practices that promote student engagement, growth, understanding, achievement, and career exploration.

To support the district's educational program, the Board shall:

	Establish standards of student achievement for core subjects at each grade level that are aligned with the district's vision for student learning, the specific needs and strengths of the students, the expectations of parents/guardians and the community, and available resources
	 
	Establish graduation requirements
	 
	Ensure that a process is in place, involving teachers, administrators, students, and parents/guardians, for the development and review of the district's curriculum
	 
	Adopt the district curriculum and courses of study to be offered
	 
	Adopt textbooks and other instructional materials
	 
	Support the professional staff's implementation of the curriculum by providing consistent policy direction, allocating resources based on educational program priorities, ensuring that collective bargaining agreements do not constrain the district's ability to achieve curricular goals, recognizing staff accomplishments, and including reasonable annual goals related to student learning in the Superintendent evaluation process
	 
	Provide a continuing program of professional development to keep instructional staff, administrators, and Board members updated about current issues and research pertaining to curriculum, instructional strategies, and student assessment
	 
	Review and evaluate the educational program on the basis of state and federal accountability measures, disaggregated student achievement data, and other indicators and ensure that evaluation results are used to improve programs, curriculum, and/or instructional practices as necessary to enhance student achievement
	 
	Communicate clear information about district instructional goals, programs, and progress in student achievement to the community and media

The Superintendent or designee shall:


	Review research related to curriculum issues
	 
	Select and/or develop curricula for recommendation to the Board in accordance with the district's curriculum development and review process
	 
	Ensure the articulation of the curriculum between grade levels and with postsecondary education and the workplace
	 
	Determine the general methods of instruction to be used
	 
	Assign instructors and schedule classes for all curricular offerings
	 
	Recommend instructional materials to the Board and direct the purchase of approved materials and equipment
	 
	Evaluate and report to the Board on student achievement as demonstrated through testing and other types of appraisal, and recommend necessary changes in curriculum, programs, and instruction as indicated by student performance data

Comparability in Instruction

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional. 5 CCR 4424 requires districts to demonstrate comparability of services as a condition of receiving grants for compensatory education programs. In addition, 20 USC 6321 mandates districts receiving Title I funds to have policy on comparability in instruction; see BP/AR 6171 - Title I Programs for language fulfilling this mandate.
The district shall provide comparable educational opportunities for all students. Instruction in the core curriculum shall be in no way diminished when students receive supplementary services funded by special governmental programs. Services funded by any categorical program shall supplement, not supplant, the district-provided core curriculum and any services which may be provided by other categorical programs.
