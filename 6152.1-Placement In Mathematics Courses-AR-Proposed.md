Placement Protocols

In determining student placement in mathematics courses for students entering grade 9, the Superintendent or designee shall assess whether each student has the prerequisite skills for success in the course and consider student and parent/guardian requests. Such determinations shall be based on multiple measures, including, but not limited to, the following:

	Interim and summative grade 8 mathematics assessments from the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress
	 
	For students with disabilities, an alternate test or other measures when designated in a student's individualized education program (IEP)
	 
	Other assessments such as Measures of Academic Progress, the readiness tests of the University of California's Mathematics Diagnosis Testing Project, and/or District benchmark assessments
	 
	The student's grades in previous mathematics course
	 
	The final mathematics grade on the end-of-year report card

Individual student performance data shall be analyzed each spring, prior to scheduling and placing students into secondary mathematics courses. Students and parents/guardians shall be notified in writing by the end of the school year as to the mathematics course in which the student has been placed.

No student shall be required to repeat a mathematics course which the student has successfully completed in accordance with District's placement protocols.

When a student does not qualify to be enrolled in a particular mathematics course based on a consideration of the objective measures specified in the placement protocol, the student may nevertheless be admitted to the course based on the recommendation of a teacher or counselor who has personal knowledge of the student's academic ability.

Students who exhibit deficits in knowledge and skills needed to advance to a higher level mathematics course may receive supplemental instruction to improve achievement of mathematic content standards.

Reevaluation

Within the first month of the school year, mathematics course placements shall be individually reevaluated to ensure placement in the most rigorous mathematics course for which the student has the potential for success.

Criteria for reevaluating each student's placement shall include, but are not limited to, course preassessment results, attendance, and student performance in the first month of the school year as determined by teacher observation and grades on assignments and tests. Student and parent/guardian request for course placement may also be considered.

Notification of Placement Protocol

The District's policy and protocols related to student placement in mathematics courses shall be posted on the District's website.  (Education Code 51224.7)

The Superintendent or designee shall also make the District's placement policy, protocols, and course sequence readily accessible to students, parents/guardians, and staff at school sites and/or in student handbooks.

Appeals

Within 10 school days of an initial placement decision or a placement decision upon reevaluation, a student and the student's parent/guardian who disagree with the placement may appeal the decision to the Superintendent or designee. The Superintendent or designee shall rule on the appeal within 10 school days of receiving the appeal. The decision of the Superintendent or designee shall be final.
