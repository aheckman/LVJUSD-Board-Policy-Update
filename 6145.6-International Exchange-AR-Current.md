CSBA NOTE:  The following optional administrative regulation is for use by districts that maintain secondary schools and accept enrollment of international students through approved programs sponsored by International Student Exchange Placement Organizations.
Admission

Prior to enrolling an international exchange student, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the International Student Exchange Placement Organization with written acceptance for the enrollment, including arrangements concerning the payment of tuition or the waiver of the tuition if applicable.  (11 CCR 361; 22 CFR 62.25)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to set a date by which the request for enrollment must be received.
In order to approve the admission of an international exchange student, the Superintendent or designee must receive a written request for enrollment before the end of the preceding school year.

Enrollment shall be for one semester or one school year.  (22 CFR 62.25)

All international exchange students shall meet state and district immunization requirements.

Athletics

CSBA NOTE: State bylaws of the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) list eligibility requirements for participation by international exchange students in interscholastic athletics. These requirements include, but are not limited to, requiring that the student has been placed with a host family by an exchange program accepted for listing by the Council for Standards for International Educational Travel and approved by the CIF, California Attorney General's Office, and U.S. Department of State. Individual CIF section bylaws may have additional requirements.
International exchange students shall be eligible for participation in interscholastic sports in accordance with state bylaws of the California Interscholastic Federation as well as applicable section bylaws.

Diplomas

CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to Education Code 51225.5, the Governing Board may grant an honorary diploma to international exchange students who have completed the course of study required for graduation and are returning to their home countries following completion of one school year. Honorary diplomas must be distinguishable from the district's regular diploma. See BP 6146.1 - High School Graduation Requirements.The following optional paragraph provides standards for the granting of the honorary diploma and should be revised to reflect district practice.
International exchange students who are not eligible for a regular diploma may receive an honorary diploma, provided they have completed at least one semester of full-time enrollment and achieved at least a 2.0 grade point average.

International exchange students who do not meet requirements for a regular or an honorary diploma may, at the end of their visit, be given a certificate or letter certifying the time period for which they were enrolled as well as a transcript documenting their completed coursework.
