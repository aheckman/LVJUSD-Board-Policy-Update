## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes that the success of district students and programs hinges on effective personnel.  The Board desires to establish safe and supportive working conditions that will attract and retain staff members who are highly qualified and dedicated to the education and welfare of students.  The district's personnel policies and related regulations shall be designed to ensure a supportive, positive climate and shall be consistent with collective bargaining agreements and in conformance with state and federal law and regulations.

As the legal representative of the district in negotiations with employee representatives, the Board shall set goals and guidelines for collective bargaining, select the bargaining team, maintain communications during the bargaining process, and adopt the negotiated contract.  Terms and conditions of employment which have been negotiated and stated in employee contracts shall have the force of policy.  The Board shall hear employee complaints and appeals when such hearings are in accordance with Board policy or negotiated agreements.  The Board shall also adopt wage and salary schedules and shall commit budget funds for staff development so that staff members may continue developing their skills.

The Superintendent has primary responsibility for overseeing the district's personnel system.  To support this effort, the Board shall approve a framework for sound hiring practices.  The Superintendent shall nominate all personnel for employment, and the Board shall approve only those persons so recommended.  Individuals who approach Board members regarding prospective employment shall be referred to the Superintendent or designee.

The Superintendent or designee shall assign and supervise the work of all employees and shall evaluate their work in accordance with effective accountability systems approved by the Board.  The Superintendent or designee also shall recommend disciplinary action which the Board may take against employees when warranted pursuant to Board policy, administrative regulations and/or state or federal law.

The Board recognizes that every employee has a stake in the district's successful operation.  The Board encourages all district employees to express their ideas, concerns and proposals related to the improvement of working conditions and the total educational program.  The Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures whereby he/she will receive and consider employee suggestions and submit them, when appropriate, for consideration by the Board.
