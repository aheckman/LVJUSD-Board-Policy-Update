## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that effective management is vital to the success of District students and programs.  Management personnel are expected to demonstrate initiative and good judgment in the development, implementation, and oversight of District programs.  Supervisors shall promote the productivity, professional growth, and teamwork of District staff.

The Board shall adopt policies related to administrative and supervisory personnel insofar as they are needed to comply with law and describe terms of employment within the District.

The Board may, by resolution, establish or abolish any or all positions of the senior management of the classified service.  Any employee occupying a senior management position abolished by Board action shall become a member of the classified or certificated service in a position to which he/she would otherwise be entitled if he/she had not been in a senior management position.  (Education Code 45104.5)
