## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to ensure the most effective use of available funding to improve outcomes for all students. A comprehensive, data-driven planning process shall be used to identify annual goals and specific actions which are aligned with the District budget and facilitate continuous improvement of District practices.

The Board shall adopt a Districtwide local control and accountability plan (LCAP) and an annual update to the LCAP, based on the most up-to-date template adopted by the State Board of Education (SBE), that addresses the state priorities in Education Code 52060 and any local priorities adopted by the Board. The LCAP and the annual update shall be adopted or updated, as required, on or before July 1 of each year.  (Education Code 52060, 52064; 5 CCR 15494-15497)

The LCAP and the annual update shall focus on improving outcomes for all students, particularly those who are "unduplicated students" or are part of any numerically significant student subgroup that is at risk of or is underperforming.  (Education Code 52060, 52064)

An "unduplicated student" is a student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals, who is an English learner, or who is a foster youth, as defined in Education Code 42238.01.  (Education Code 42238.02)

Numerically significant student subgroups include ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, long-term English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and students experiencing homelessness, when there are at least 30 students in the subgroup or at least 15 foster youth, students experiencing homelessness, or long-term English learners.  (Education Code 52052)

The LCAP shall also include focused goals, as specified in Education Code 52064, for each school generating local control funding formula (LCFF) equity multiplier funds.

Beginning July 1, 2027, if the District is identified by the California Department of Education (CDE) as needing an improvement plan pursuant to 34 CFR 300.600-300.647, the Board shall adopt, and update on an annual basis, an Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Addendum, based on the template adopted by SBE. However, if the District adopts an improvement plan after being identified, but before July 1, 2027, the IDEA Addendum shall be developed upon expiration of the adopted improvement plan, but no later than July 1, 2030, whichever occurs first. The IDEA Addendum shall be developed, reviewed, and approved in conjunction with and in the same manner as the LCAP and the annual update, and shall be submitted to CDE within 15 days of adoption by the Board.  (Education Code 52064.3)

The Superintendent or designee shall review the school plan for student achievement (SPSA) submitted by each District school pursuant to Education Code 64001 to ensure that the specific actions included in the LCAP are consistent with strategies included in the SPSA.  (Education Code 52062)

The LCAP shall also be aligned with other District and school plans, to the extent possible, in order to minimize duplication of effort and provide clear direction for program implementation.

As part of the adoption of the LCAP and the annual update, the Board shall separately adopt a LCFF budget overview for parents/guardians, based on the template developed by SBE, which includes specified information relating to the District's budget. The budget overview shall be adopted, reviewed, and approved in the same manner as the LCAP and the annual update.  (Education Code 52064.1)

Advisory Committees

The Board shall establish a parent advisory committee, which shall be composed of a majority of parents/guardians and shall include parents/guardians of unduplicated students and parents/guardians of students with disabilities.  (Education Code 52063; 5 CCR 15495)

Whenever District enrollment includes at least 15 percent English learners, with at least 50 students who are English learners, the Board shall establish an English Learner Parent Advisory Committee, which shall be composed of a majority of parents/guardians of English learners.  (Education Code 52063; 5 CCR 15495)

The District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) may serve as the District's LCAP English Learner Parent Advisory Committee, as specified in Administrative Regulation 6174 - Education for English Learners.

Unless a student advisory committee is established to provide advice to the Board and Superintendent, two students shall be included as full members of the parent advisory committee. The students shall serve for a renewable term of one full school year.  (Education Code 52063)

Student members of the parent advisory committee or the student advisory committee shall represent the diversity of the District's students, including geographical, socioeconomic, cultural, physical, and educational diversity, and particular effort shall be made to reach out to at-risk or disadvantaged students to serve as members of such committees.  (Education Code 52063)

The Superintendent or designee shall present the LCAP and the annual update to each of these committee(s) before they are submitted to the Board for adoption, and shall respond in writing to comments received from the committee(s).

LCAP Development and Consultation

The Superintendent or designee shall gather data and information needed for effective and meaningful development of the LCAP and present it to the Board and community. Such data and information shall include, but not be limited to, data regarding the number of students in student subgroups, disaggregated data on student achievement levels, and information about current programs and expenditures.

The Board shall consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, employee bargaining units, parents/guardians, and students in developing the LCAP and the annual update. Consultation with students shall enable unduplicated students and other numerically significant student subgroups to review and comment on LCAP development and may include surveys of students, student forums and committees, and/or meetings with student government bodies or other groups representing students.  (Education Code 52060; 5 CCR 15495)

As part of the parent/guardian and community engagement process, the District shall solicit input on effective and appropriate instructional methods, including, but not limited to, establishing language acquisition programs to enable all students, including English learners and native English speakers, to have access to the core academic content standards and to become proficient in English.  (Education Code 305-306)

The Superintendent or designee shall consult with the administrator(s) of the special education local plan area of which the District is a member to ensure that specific actions for students with disabilities are included in the LCAP and are consistent with strategies included in the annual assurances support plan for the education of students with disabilities.  (Education Code 52062)

The Superintendent or designee shall notify members of the public of the opportunity to submit written comments regarding the specific actions and expenditures proposed to be included in the LCAP and the annual update. The notification shall be provided using the most efficient method of notification possible, which may not necessarily include producing printed notices or sending notices by mail. All written notifications related to the LCAP and the annual update shall be provided in the primary language of parents/guardians when required by Education Code 48985.  (Education Code 52062)

The Board shall hold at least one public hearing to solicit the recommendations and comments of members of the public regarding the specific actions and expenditures proposed to be included in the LCAP and the annual update. The public hearing shall be held at the same meeting as the budget hearing required pursuant to Education Code 42127 and Board Policy 3100 - Budget.  (Education Code 52062)

Adoption and Submission

The Board shall adopt the LCAP and the annual update prior to adopting the District budget, but at the same public meeting. This meeting shall be held after the public hearing described above, but not on the same day as the hearing.  (Education Code 52062)

Not later than five days after adoption of the LCAP, the annual update, the District budget, and the budget overview for parents/guardians, the Board shall file the LCAP, the annual update, the budget, and the budget overview with the County Superintendent of Schools.  (Education Code 42127, 52064.1, 52070)

If the County Superintendent sends, by August 15, a written request for clarification of the contents of the LCAP and the annual update, the Board shall respond in writing within 15 days of the request. If the County Superintendent then submits recommendations for amendments within 15 days of receiving the Board's response, the Board shall consider those recommendations in a public meeting within 15 days of receiving the recommendations.  (Education Code 52070)

If the County Superintendent does not approve the District's LCAP and the annual update, the Board shall accept technical assistance from the County Superintendent focused on revising the LCAP and the annual update so that they can be approved.  (Education Code 52071)

If the Board is unable to review local indicator data due to any emergency specified in Education Code 46392, the local indicator data shall be reviewed at the next Board meeting, and a resolution describing the emergency event and the date on which the local indicator data was reviewed shall be adopted and submitted to CDE.  (Education Code 52064.5)
