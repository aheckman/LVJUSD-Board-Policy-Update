	Parents/guardians of students attending the school and/or other members of the community, selected by the parents/guardians of students attending the school
	 
	If the school is a secondary school, students attending the school selected by other secondary students

Half of the school site council membership shall consist of school staff in the categories listed in items #1-3 above, the majority of whom shall be classroom teachers. For an elementary school site council, the remaining half shall be parents/guardians and/or community members. For a secondary school site council, the remaining half shall be parents/guardians, community members, and/or students.  (Education Code 65000)

A District employee may serve as a parent/guardian representative on the school site council of the school his/her child attends, provided the employee does not work at that school.  (Education Code 65000)

The bylaws of each school site council shall include the method of selecting members and officers, terms of office, responsibilities of council members, time commitment, and a policy of nondiscrimination and equity.

School site councils shall operate in accordance with procedural meeting requirements established in Education Code 35147.

School Plan for Student Achievement

The school site council shall develop and annually review and update an SPSA that addresses all federal and/or state categorical programs in which the school participates pursuant to Education Code 64000.  (Education Code 64001)

The SPSA shall be developed with the review, certification, and advice of the school English learner advisory committee, if required.  (Education Code 64001)

Other school and District committees, including, but not limited to, a parent advisory committee established to review and comment on the District's local control and accountability plan (LCAP), advisory committee established for special education programs, and Western Association of Schools and Colleges leadership teams, may also be consulted on the content of the plan.

Before developing the content of the SPSA, the school site council shall conduct a comprehensive needs assessment pursuant to 20 USC 6314, including an analysis of verifiable state data consistent with the state priorities specified in Education Code 52060 and the indicators in the state accountability system. The school may consider any other data developed by the District to measure student outcomes.  (Education Code 64001)

The SPSA shall include all of the following:  (Education Code 64001)


	 Goals to improve student outcomes, including goals that address the needs of student groups as identified through the needs assessment
	 
	Evidence-based strategies, actions, or services
	 
	Proposed expenditures based on the projected resource allocation from the District to address the findings of the needs assessment, including identifying resource inequities, which may include a review of the District's budgeting, the LCAP, and school-level budgeting, if applicable

In addition to meeting the requirements common to all applicable school plans, the SPSA shall address any content required by law for each individual categorical program in which the school participates.

The school site council shall approve the proposed SPSA at a meeting for which public notice has been posted. Whenever there are material revisions to the SPSA which affect the academic programs for students participating in applicable programs, the SPSA shall be submitted to the Board of Education for review and approval at a regularly scheduled Board meeting.  (Education Code 35147, 64001)

The school site council shall regularly monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the SPSA and modify any activities that prove ineffective. At least once per year, the principal or designee shall evaluate results of improvement efforts and report to the Board, school site council, and other interested parties regarding progress toward school goals.

The school site council may amend the SPSA at any time through the same process required for the annual update of the plan.
