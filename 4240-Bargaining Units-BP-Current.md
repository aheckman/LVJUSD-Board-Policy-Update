## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3544, an employee organization may become the employees' exclusive representative for negotiations by filing a request with the district providing proof that a majority of specified employees wish to be represented by that organization. Notice of such request must be immediately posted conspicuously on all employee bulletin boards in each district facility in which employees to be represented by that organization are employed. Government Code 3544.1 requires the district to grant the request for recognition unless (1) the district doubts the appropriateness of the organization, (2) another employee organization files a challenge to the appropriateness of the organization or submits a competing claim of representation within 15 work days of the posting of notice of the written request, or (3) the district currently has a lawful written agreement with another employee organization representing the same employees.While the terms "employee organization," "exclusive representative," "recognized employee organization," and "bargaining unit" are similar, the differences are important for purposes of understanding the rights and obligations of each one. As defined by Government 3540.1, "employee organization" means an organization that includes district employees that represents those employees in their relations with the district as one of its primary purposes; "exclusive representative" means an employee organization recognized or certified as the exclusive negotiating representative for all district employees other than management and confidential employees; and "recognized employee organization" means an employee organization that has been recognized by a district as the exclusive representative. "Bargaining unit" is not defined in statute but is used in this policy to referred to the entity with which the district is required to bargain regarding compensation and working conditions for a represented group of district employees.Government Code 3543 provides that public school employees have the right to represent themselves individually in their employment relations with the district except that, once an exclusive representative has been recognized, an employee in that bargaining unit is prohibited from meeting and negotiating with the district.
The Governing Board recognizes the right of district employees to form a bargaining unit and to select an employee organization as the exclusive representative for the employees in the employees' employment relationship with the district. The Board is committed to negotiating in good faith with the exclusive representative and respecting the rights of employees and employee organizations.

The district shall not dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any employee organization or contribute financial or other support to it.  (Government Code 3543.5)

CSBA NOTE: The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) uses a case-by-case approach to determine whether a district's policy restricting the wearing of union buttons, insignia, or other pictorial or written messages by employees is justified by special circumstances. In East Whittier School District, PERB found that the district's policy limiting the wearing of union buttons that favor or oppose any matter that is the subject of negotiations in the classroom or in other instructional areas in the presence of students violated the Educational Employment Relations Act, as there was no finding of special circumstances which would limit the established right of employees to wear union buttons in the workplace, nor was there a finding that wearing the union buttons was a political activity. Due to the legal uncertainty in this area, districts are encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel prior to limiting the wearing of union buttons, insignia, or other pictorial or written messages.
Employees shall not be prohibited from wearing union buttons, insignia, or other pictorial or written messages that favor or oppose the formation of a bargaining unit or any matter that is the subject of negotiations.

Formation of Bargaining Units

CSBA NOTE: The following section contains legal requirements for the certification or recognition of bargaining units for different categories of employees.
Certificated and classified employees shall not be included in the same bargaining unit. (Government Code 3545)

A bargaining unit of certificated or classified supervisory employees may only be recognized if the bargaining unit includes all certificated or classified supervisory employees, respectively, and is not represented by the same employee organization that represents district employees who are supervised by the supervisory employees.  (Government Code 3545)

For this purpose, supervisory employee means any employee, regardless of job description, having authority, in the interest of the district, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or the responsibility to assign work to, direct, or adjust grievance of other employees, or effectively recommend that action, when the exercise of that authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.  (Government Code 3540.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3543.4, management (including senior management) and confidential employees, as defined in Government Code 3540.1, are excluded from the right to be represented in negotiations by an exclusive representative. Certain management positions designated by the Board under state law such as Education Code 45100.5 may be subject to review by PERB. For questions regarding which positions qualify as "management" or "confidential," districts are encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
Employees serving in management, senior management, or confidential positions shall not be represented by an exclusive representative. In the employment relationship with the district, employees who serve in a management, senior management, or confidential position may represent themselves or be represented by an employee organization whose membership is composed entirely of employees designated as holding those positions. However, an employee organization representing management, senior management, or confidential employees shall not be permitted to meet and negotiate with the district on behalf of the employees.  (Education Code 45100.5, Government Code 3543.4)

Management employee means an employee in a position having significant responsibilities for formulating district policies or administering district programs.  (Government Code 3540.1)

Confidential employee means any employee who is required to develop or present management positions with respect to employer-employee relations or whose duties normally require access to confidential information that is used to contribute significantly to the development of management positions.  (Government Code 3540.1)

Membership

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 3550 prohibits districts from deterring or discouraging district employees or job applicants from becoming or remaining members of an employee organization, authorizing representation by an employee organization, or authorizing dues or fee deductions to an employee organization. Pursuant to Government Code 3551.5, any district found by PERB to be in violation of this prohibition may be subject to civil penalties of $1,000 for each affected employee, up to a maximum of $100,000 in total, and may be ordered to pay attorney's fees and costs to the employee organization.
The district shall not deter or discourage employees or job applicants from becoming or remaining members of an employee organization, authorizing representation by an employee organization, or authorizing dues or fee deductions to an employee organization. In addition, the district shall not impose or threaten to impose reprisals on employees, discriminate or threaten to discriminate against employees, or otherwise interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees because of their membership or nonmembership in an employee organization.  (Government Code 3543.5, 3550, 3551.5)

District Communications to Employees

CSBA NOTE: This section is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice. Government Code 3553 establishes requirements for districts that choose to disseminate a mass communication regarding employees' rights to join, support, or refrain from joining or supporting an employee organization. A "mass communication" means any written document, including a script for an oral or recorded presentation or message, intended for multiple employees.Districts should exercise caution and consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel before communicating with employees about their rights to join or not join an employee organization to avoid violating the law against unfair labor practices. When an employee approaches the district with questions specifically about the benefits of membership in an employee organization, the employee should be referred to the employee organization.
The Superintendent or designee may communicate with district employees regarding their rights to join and/or support or to refrain from joining or supporting an officially recognized employee organization. Such communications shall be factual and accurate and may not promise a benefit, threaten a reprisal, or in any way deter or discourage employees from joining an employee organization or paying dues.

The district may disseminate written documents, recorded messages, or other mass communications to actual or prospective employees represented by an exclusive representative concerning their rights to join and/or support, or refrain from joining and/or supporting, an employee organization only after the Superintendent or designee meets and confers with the exclusive representative concerning the content of the mass communication. If the district and exclusive representative do not come to agreement on the content of the mass communication and the district still chooses to disseminate it, the Superintendent or designee shall request that the exclusive representative provide a communication of reasonable length to the district that shall be disseminated to the employees at the same time as the district's own mass communication.  (Government Code 3553)

Access to New Employee Orientations

The district shall permit each exclusive representative access to new employee orientation or onboarding process where newly hired employees represented by the exclusive representative are advised, whether in person, online, or through other means or mediums, of their employment status, rights, benefits, duties, responsibilities, or any other employment-related matters. The district shall provide the exclusive representative at least 10 days' notice in advance of an orientation, except that a shorter notice may be provided where there is an urgent need critical to the district's operations that was not reasonably foreseeable.  (Government Code 3556)

Following a request to negotiate by either party, the structure, time, and manner of access to new employee orientations shall be determined by mutual agreement of the district and the exclusive representative. If the district and exclusive representative fail to reach an agreement, the structure, time, and manner of access to the new employee orientation shall be subject to compulsory interest arbitration. The district and the exclusive representative may mutually agree to submit any dispute to compulsory interest arbitration at any time. In addition, if any dispute arises during negotiations and is not resolved within 45 days after the first meeting or within 60 days after the initial request to negotiate, whichever is earlier, either party may make a demand for compulsory interest arbitration. When any such dispute arises during the summer when the district's administrative office is closed, the timeline shall commence on the first day the administrative office reopens. The arbitrator's decision shall be issued within 10 days and shall be final and binding on the parties.  (Government Code 3556, 3557)

The date, time, and place of a new employee orientation shall not be disclosed to anyone other than employees, the exclusive representative, or a vendor that is contracted to provide a service for purposes of the orientation.  (Government Code 3556)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph applies until June 30, 2025.
Until June 30, 2025, unless the district and the exclusive representative have agreed otherwise, when the district has not conducted an in-person orientation within 30 days of hiring a new employee, the Superintendent or designee shall permit the exclusive representative to schedule an in-person meeting during employment hours at the new employee's worksite, during which the new employee shall have the opportunity to attend and shall be relieved of other duties for the purpose of attending the meeting. The district shall provide appropriate space at the worksite within seven calendar days of receiving a request from the exclusive representative.  (Government Code 3556, 3557)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3556, the district must provide at least 30 minutes of paid time for new employees to attend the meeting. However, nothing prohibits the district and the exclusive representative from providing more than 30 minutes of paid time.
During this meeting, the exclusive representative shall be permitted to communicate directly with the new employees for up to 30 minutes of paid time.  (Government Code 3556)

Access to Employee Contact Information

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3558 and 7928.300, which implemented the decision by the California Supreme Court in County of Los Angeles v. Los Angeles County Employee Relations Commission, districts are required to provide each exclusive representative with the home address, home telephone number(s), and personal cell phone number of every employee represented by the exclusive representative unless the district receives a written request by the employee to not disclose the information. Pursuant to Government Code 7928.300, the personal email address of an employee is not disclosable unless used by the employee to conduct public business.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide an exclusive representative with the name, job title, department, work location, telephone numbers (work, home, and personal cell phone), of all employees represented by the exclusive representative on file with the district. An employee's personal email address shall only be disclosed if it used by the employee to conduct district business.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3558, specified contact information is required to be provided for all employees every 120 days and within 30 days of the date of hire or by the first pay period of the month following the date of hire for new employees. The following paragraph should be revised if districts have an agreement with an exclusive representative requiring more frequent disclosure.
Such information shall be provided within 30 days of hire or by the first pay period of the month following hire for all new employees represented by the exclusive representative, unless the exclusive representative has agreed to a different interval for the provision of the information. Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the exclusive representative with the same information for all employees represented by the exclusive representative every 120 days, unless more frequent disclosure is required by agreement with the exclusive representative.  (Government Code 3558, 7928.300)

However, the Superintendent or designee shall not disclose:  (Government Code 3558, 6205-6210, 6215-6216, 7928.300)

	The home address and any phone numbers on file for employees performing law enforcement-related functions
	
	CSBA NOTE: he Safe at Home address confidentiality program has been in existence pursuant to Government Code 6205-6210 and 6215-6216 to protect victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, and elder or dependent adult abuse, and members of their households, as well as district employees who face threats of violence, or violence or harassment from the public because of the employee's work for the district. This type of protection has been extended, pursuant to Government Code 6205-6210, as amended by AB 243 (Ch. 642, Statutes of 2023), to victims of child abduction and members of their households.
	The home address, home telephone or personal cell phone number(s), or personal email address(es) of any employee who is a participant in the Safe at Home address confidentiality program pursuant to Government Code 6205-6210 and 6215-16
	 
	The employee's home address, home telephone and personal cell phone numbers, and personal email address of an employee not performing law enforcement related functions if the employee has submitted a written request to the district to keep such information private. In such instances, the Superintendent or designee shall also remove the employee's home address, home telephone number, and personal cell phone number from any mailing list maintained by the district unless the list is only used by the district to contact the employee.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3558, an employee organization is authorized, after notifying the district of a violation of the district's employee information disclosure obligations, to file a special unfair labor practice charge with PERB. If the alleged violation involves the provision of an inaccurate or incomplete list of employees, Government Code 3558 allows the district 20 calendar days to cure the alleged violation and to give the exclusive representative written notice of the actions taken. The opportunity to cure is limited to not more than three times in any 12-month period. If a violation is found, PERB is required to assess against the district a civil penalty of at most $10,000 and payment of the exclusive representative's attorney's fees and costs in addition to any other remedy provided by law.
Within 20 calendar days after an exclusive representative notifies the Superintendent or designee that a list of employees provided by the district is inaccurate or incomplete, the Superintendent or designee shall take steps to correct the list and provide a new list of employees to the exclusive representative.  (Government Code 3558)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 3558 limits to three times within any 12-month period a district's opportunity to cure when an inaccurate or incomplete list has been provided to an exclusive representative. The following paragraph offers a way to avoid or minimize possible violations and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall review the list of contact information for district employees at the beginning of each school year, or more often as appropriate.

Communications with Employees by Employee Organizations

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3543.1, districts are required, subject to "reasonable regulation" set forth by the district and at "reasonable times," to provide an employee organization with access to the work areas of employees represented by the employee organization and district facilities for the purpose of meetings with employees represented by the employee organization. Similarly, Government Code 3543.1 requires the district, subject to "reasonable regulation" by the district, to provide an employee organization with the use of institutional bulletin boards, mailboxes, and other means of communication to communicate with employees represented by the employee organization. In Desert Community College District, PERB held that the district must show that a regulation is "reasonable" if it is (1) necessary to the efficient operation of the district's business and/or safety of its employees and others and (2) narrowly drawn to avoid overbroard, unnecessary interference with the exercise of statutory rights. Such regulation is also subject to bargaining with the exclusive representative, if applicable. Districts are encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel prior to adopting or implementing such regulations.
Subject to reasonable regulation by the district, employee organizations shall have access, at reasonable times, to the work areas of employees represented by the employee organization and to district facilities for the purpose of meeting with employees represented by the employee organization. Access may be limited in instances where it would be disruptive to district operations.  (Government Code 3543.1)

Additionally, subject to reasonable regulation by the district, employee organizations shall have the ability to use institutional bulletin boards, mailboxes, and other means of communication to communicate with employees represented by the employee organization.  (Government Code 3543.1)

Membership Dues or Other Payments to an Employee Organization

CSBA NOTE: Employees who choose to become members of an employee organization pay membership dues, which are required to be deducted from the employee's salary or wage payment as provided below. Pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, employees who choose not to become members of an employee organization cannot be required to pay any fees to the employee organization. However, pursuant to Education Code 45060 and 45168, an employee who chooses not to join an employee organization may be charged fees for applicable services, programs, or committees provided to the employee by the employee organization if that nonmember employee first affirmatively and voluntarily consents to pay those fees to the employee organization.Education Code 45060 and 45168 set forth the process for handling authorizations, changes, and cancellations for dues or other payments, and provide safeguards for districts that rely on information provided by an employee organization concerning such payroll deductions (i.e., the employee organization's indemnification of the district against any employee's claim based on such reliance).
When drawing an order for the salary or wage payment of a bargaining unit employee of an employee organization, the district shall deduct any amount that has been requested by the employee in a revocable written authorization for the purpose of paying dues or other payments for any service, program, or committee provided or sponsored by the employee organization.  (Education Code 45060, 45168)

When an employee organization has certified to the district that it has and will maintain individual employee authorizations for payroll deductions, the district shall rely on information from the employee organization regarding the amounts of such payroll deductions and the employees to whom they apply and shall not handle or process employee written authorizations for the employees represented by such employee organization. The district also shall not require a copy of the written authorization to be submitted by the employee organization, except when there is a dispute about the existence or terms of the written authorization.  (Education Code 45060, 45168)

A written authorization shall remain in effect until expressly revoked in writing by the employee and pursuant to the terms of the written authorization. Employee requests to cancel or change authorizations for payroll deductions for employee organizations shall be directed to the employee organization that represents the employee rather than the district. The employee organization shall be responsible for processing these requests. The district shall rely on the information provided by the employee organization regarding whether deductions for an employee organization were properly canceled or changed. The employee organization shall be required to indemnify the district for any claims made by an employee for deductions made by the district in reliance on information from the employee organization.  (Education Code 45060, 45168)

When an employee organization has declined to certify that it will handle and process written authorizations from employee(s) represented by the employee organization and makes a request for payroll deductions, the district shall request a copy of the written authorization for an employee before making the payroll deductions for that employee.  (Education Code 45060, 45168)

<div id='kMQ759' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) uses a case-by-case approach to determine whether a district's policy restricting the wearing of union buttons, insignia, or other pictorial or written messages by employees is justified by special circumstances. In East Whittier School District, PERB found that the district's policy limiting the wearing of union buttons that favor or oppose any matter that is the subject of negotiations in the classroom or in other instructional areas in the presence of students violated the Educational Employment Relations Act, as there was no finding of special circumstances which would limit the established right of employees to wear union buttons in the workplace, nor was there a finding that wearing the union buttons was a political activity. Due to the legal uncertainty in this area, districts are encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel prior to limiting the wearing of union buttons, insignia, or other pictorial or written messages.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="NjcwMw1" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22NjcwMw1%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22kMQ759%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1710351476%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20Public%20Employment%20Relations%20Board%20%28PERB%29%20uses%20a%20case-by-case%20approach%20to%20determine%20whether%20a%20district%27s%20policy%20restricting%20the%20wearing%20of%20union%20buttons%2C%20insignia%2C%20or%20other%20pictorial%20or%20written%20messages%20by%20employees%20is%20justified%20by%20special%20circumstances.%20In%20East%20Whittier%20School%20District%2C%20PERB%20found%20that%20the%20district%27s%20policy%20limiting%20the%20wearing%20of%20union%20buttons%20that%20favor%20or%20oppose%20any%20matter%20that%20is%20the%20subject%20of%20negotiations%20in%20the%20classroom%20or%20in%20other%20instructional%20areas%20in%20the%20presence%20of%20students%20violated%20the%20Educational%20Employment%20Relations%20Act%2C%20as%20there%20was%20no%20finding%20of%20special%20circumstances%20which%20would%20limit%20the%20established%20right%20of%20employees%20to%20wear%20union%20buttons%20in%20the%20workplace%2C%20nor%20was%20there%20a%20finding%20that%20wearing%20the%20union%20buttons%20was%20a%20political%20activity.%20Due%20to%20the%20legal%20uncertainty%20in%20this%20area%2C%20districts%20are%20encouraged%20to%20consult%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel%20prior%20to%20limiting%20the%20wearing%20of%20union%20buttons%2C%20insignia%2C%20or%20other%20pictorial%20or%20written%20messages.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-NjcwMw1" title="CSBA NOTE: The Public Employment Relations Board (..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

<strong>Communications with Employees by Employee Organizations</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='QNQ771' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3543.1, districts are required, subject to "reasonable regulation" set forth by the district and at "reasonable times," to provide an employee organization with access to the work areas of employees represented by the employee organization and district facilities for the purpose of meetings with employees represented by the employee organization. Similarly, Government Code 3543.1 requires the district, subject to "reasonable regulation" by the district, to provide an employee organization with the use of institutional bulletin boards, mailboxes, and other means of communication to communicate with employees represented by the employee organization. In Desert Community College District, PERB held that the district must show that a regulation is "reasonable" if it is (1) necessary to the efficient operation of the district's business and/or safety of its employees and others and (2) narrowly drawn to avoid overbroard, unnecessary interference with the exercise of statutory rights. Such regulation is also subject to bargaining with the exclusive representative, if applicable.
