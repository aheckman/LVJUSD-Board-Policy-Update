## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that parents/guardians of District students have certain rights as well as responsibilities related to the education of their children.

The Board believes that the education of the District's students is a shared responsibility. The Superintendent or designee shall work with parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English learners, to determine appropriate roles and responsibilities of parents/guardians, school staff and students for continuing the intellectual, physical, emotional and social development and well-being of students at each school site, including the means by which the schools and parents/guardians can help students achieve academic and other standards of the school.

Within this framework, the school's primary responsibility shall be to provide a high-quality curriculum and instructional program in a supportive and effective learning environment that enables all students to meet the academic expectations of the school.

Parents/guardians shall have the opportunity to work with schools in a mutually supportive and respectful partnership and to help their children succeed in school.   (Education Code 51100)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that District staff understand the rights of parents/guardians afforded by law and Board policy and follow acceptable practices that respect those rights.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that parents/guardians receive notification regarding their rights in accordance with law.

The Superintendent or designee shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all parents/guardians who speak a language other than English are properly notified in English, and in their home language of the rights and opportunities available to them pursuant to Education Code 48985.  (Education Code 51101.1)
