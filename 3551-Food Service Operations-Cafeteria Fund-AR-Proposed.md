	Including the policy in print versions of student handbooks, if provided to parents/guardians annually
	 
	Providing the policy whenever parents/guardians are notified regarding the application process for free and reduced-price meals, such as in the distribution of eligibility forms at the start of the school year
	 
	Posting the policy on the District's website

Reimbursement Claims

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records of the number of meals served each day by school site and by category of free and reduced-price meals.

Cafeteria Fund and Account

All proceeds from food sales and other services offered by the cafeteria shall be deposited in the cafeteria fund as provided by law.  (Education Code 38090, 38093)

The District may use cafeteria funds to supplement the provision of a nutritionally adequate breakfast and/or lunch to District students when permitted by law.

Any charges to, or transfers from, a food service program shall be dated and accompanied by a written explanation of the purpose of and basis for the expenditure.  (Education Code 38101)

Any contract for management of the food service operation shall be approved by CDE and comply with the conditions in Education Code 49554 and 7 CFR 210.16 as applicable.

Any contract for consulting services shall not result in the supervision of food service classified staff by the management consultant, nor shall it result in the elimination of any food service classified staff or position or have any adverse effect on the wages, benefits, or other terms and conditions of employment of classified food service staff or positions. All persons providing consulting services shall be subject to applicable employment conditions related to health and safety as listed in Education Code 45103.5.  (Education Code 45103.5)
