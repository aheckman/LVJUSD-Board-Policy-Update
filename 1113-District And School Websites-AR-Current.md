## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation is for use by districts that maintain their own website(s) and should be revised to reflect district practice.
Design Standards

The Superintendent or designee shall develop design standards for district and school websites that include, but are not limited to, guidelines to ensure the clear organization of the material, readability of the font type and size, and simplicity of the navigation structure linking the content on the website. Such standards shall take into consideration the ease of use on a wide range of devices.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 USC 12131-12134) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 705, 794; 34 CFR 104.1-104.39), districts have an obligation to provide an equal opportunity to individuals with disabilities to participate in and receive the benefits of the educational program. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights June 2010 and May 2011 Dear Colleague Letters interpret that such obligations include the requirement that district websites be accessible to individuals with disabilities.While there are no explicit standards detailed in law or regulations addressing accessible features, the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 and Web Accessibility Initiative Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite are widely used tools that may serve as guidelines for district and school websites. Additionally, examples of technical standards for accessibility are available on the California Department of Education's website.
In accordance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, district and school websites shall contain features that ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities, which may include, but are not limited to, captions for videos and multimedia presentations, text alternatives to images, provision of sufficient time to use the content, avoidance of flashing images, adequate contrast in visual presentations, and/or other features that meet applicable standards for website accessibility. The Superintendent or designee shall regularly review district and school websites and modify them as needed to ensure legal compliance with accessibility standards.

Website Content

CSBA NOTE: The following section may be revised to reflect district practice.Government Code 54954.2 requires the district to post a "prominent, direct link" to the current Board meeting agenda on the primary homepage of the district's website. However, districts that use an integrated agenda management platform (i.e., a website dedicated to providing the entirety of the agenda information for the Governing Board) are exempt from this requirement if a direct link to the platform is posted on the homepage and the current agenda is the first agenda available at the top of the platform. Government Code 54954.2 specifies that agendas posted either through a direct link or through use of an integrated agenda management platform must be (1) retrievable, downloadable, indexable, and electronically searchable by commonly used Internet search applications, (2) platform independent and machine readable, and (3) available to the public free of charge and without any restriction that would impede the reuse or redistribution of the agenda.
As applicable, district and school websites shall provide current information regarding the district's mission and goals, district/school programs and operations, district/school news, agendas and minutes of Governing Board meetings, School Accountability Report Cards, school calendars, links to educational resources.

With approval of the principal, individual teachers may create web pages linked to the district or school website to provide information pertaining to class assignments, expectations, and activities.

CSBA NOTE: In determining whether to limit or allow the ability of certain groups or individuals to provide content for district or school websites, districts should consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel on matters pertaining to protected speech and equal access; see BP/AR 5145.2 - Freedom of Speech/Expression and BP/AR 6145.5 - Student Organizations and Equal Access.
Student work may be published on district or school websites provided that both the student and the student's parent/guardian provide written permission or the work is part of an existing publication such as a school newspaper.

CSBA NOTE: Federal copyright law (17 USC 106) grants a copyright owner the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, make derivative works of, publicly perform, or publicly display the copyrighted work or to authorize others to do so. However, pursuant to 17 USC 107, "fair use" (i.e., the reproduction of limited portions of copyrighted materials without the copyright owner's permission) is allowed for such purposes as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research; see BP/AR 6162.6 - Use of Copyrighted Materials. Even if use of certain copyrighted materials in the district meets the criteria for a fair use exception, text, art, or photos that are not clearly stated to be in the "public domain" and available for free use should not be replicated on a district or school website without prior permission of the copyright owner.
Any copyrighted material to be posted on a district or school website shall be submitted to the Superintendent or designee together with the permission of the copyright owner to reprint the material. Any copyrighted material submitted without the copyright owner's permission shall only be posted on a district or school website if the Superintendent or designee determines that the material is in the public domain or that the intended use meets the criteria for fair use or another exception pursuant to 17 USC 107-122. When any copyrighted material is posted, the website shall include a notice crediting the copyright owner and, as necessary, shall note that permission to reprint the material was granted.

Whenever a district or school website includes links to external websites, it shall include a disclaimer that the district is not responsible for the content of external websites.

Roles and Responsibilities

Any employee assigned as a district or school webmaster shall be responsible for the uploading of material to the website(s) upon approval of the Superintendent or designee. The employee shall review district and school websites to ensure consistency with district standards, regularly check links for accuracy and appropriateness, keep the web server free of outdated or unused files, and provide technical assistance as needed.

The Superintendent or designee may assign additional staff members to conduct editorial reviews of all materials submitted for publication on district or school websites and to make corrections as needed in spelling, grammar, or accuracy of content.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide staff development opportunities related to district content guidelines, design standards, and accessibility laws and standards to district communications and technology staff, district and school webmasters, and/or other appropriate staff.

Security

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 11549.3 authorizes districts, at district expense, to request the Military Department, in consultation with the California Cybersecurity Integration Center, to perform an independent security assessment of the district or individual district schools. Districts are encouraged to consult with the California Office of Emergency Services (OES) and utilize resources such as the State Threat Assessment System and Regional Fusion Centers to help assess potential threats. For more information, see OES' Cybersecurity Integration Center website.
Pursuant to Education Code 35266, districts that experience a cyberattack which impacts more than 500 students or personnel are required to report such cyberattack to the California Cybersecurity Integration Center.

The Superintendent or designee shall establish security procedures for the district's computer network to prevent unauthorized access and changes to district and school websites. To the extent possible, the host computer(s) shall be in a lockable room with restricted access.
