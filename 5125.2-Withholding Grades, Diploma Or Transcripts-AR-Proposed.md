## Policy Content

When a minor student willfully cuts, defaces, or otherwise injures real or personal property of the District or willfully does not return District property that has been loaned to the student, the student's parents/guardians may be required to pay the costs of all damages within the limits established pursuant to Education Code 48904. Until the student's parents/guardians have paid for the damages or the student has completed voluntary work or other nonmonetary alternative offered by the District in lieu of monetary damages, the Superintendent or designee may withhold the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts.  (Education Code 48904, 49014)

This administrative regulation shall not apply to a student who is a current or former homeless or foster youth.  (Education Code 49014)

Before withholding a student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts, the Superintendent or designee shall inform the student's parents/guardians in writing of the student's alleged misconduct.  (Education Code 48904)

The student shall be afforded due process consistent with procedures established for the expulsion of students.  (Education Code 48904)

When a student who is transferring into the District has had grades, a diploma, and/or transcripts withheld by the previous district, the Superintendent or designee shall continue to withhold the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts until notified by the previous District that the decision to withhold has been rescinded.  (Education Code 48904.3)

Upon receiving notice that a student whose grades, diploma, and/or transcripts have been withheld by this District has transferred to another district in California, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the student's records to the new district and notify the new district that the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts are being withheld from the student and parents/guardians pursuant to Education Code 48904.

The Superintendent or designee shall also notify the student's parents/guardians in writing that the decision to withhold the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts will be enforced by the new district.  (Education Code 48904.3)
