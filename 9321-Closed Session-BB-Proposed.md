Matters Related to Students

If a public hearing would lead to the disclosure of confidential student information such as grades or discipline information, the Board shall meet in closed session to consider a suspension, disciplinary action, any other action against a student except expulsion, or a challenge to a student record.

Anticipated Litigation/Initiation of Litigation

Based on the advice of its legal counsel, the Board may hold a closed session to confer with or receive advice from its legal counsel regarding anticipated litigation or whether to initiate litigation when discussion of either matter in open session would prejudice the District's position with respect to such litigation. For this purpose, "litigation" means any adjudicatory proceeding, including eminent domain, before a court, administrative body exercising its adjudicatory authority, hearing officer, or arbitrator.  (Government Code 54956.9)

Litigation is considered to be "anticipated" when, in the Board's opinion based on the advice of its legal counsel regarding the existing facts and circumstances, there is a significant exposure to litigation against the District or against a District officer or employee based on prior or prospective activities or alleged activities during and potentially during the course and scope of that office or employment.  (Government Code 54956.9)

Existing facts and circumstances are limited to the following:  (Government Code 54956.9)

	Facts and circumstances that might result in litigation against the District but which the District believes are not yet known to potential plaintiff(s)
	 
	Facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, an accident, disaster, incident, or transactional occurrence which might result in litigation against the District, which are already known to potential plaintiff(s)
	 
	The receipt of a claim pursuant to the Government Claims Act or a written threat of litigation from a potential plaintiff
	 
	A threat of litigation made by a person in an open meeting on a specific matter within the responsibility of the Board
	 
	A threat of litigation made by a person outside of an open meeting on a specific matter within the responsibility of the Board, provided that the District official or employee receiving knowledge of the threat made a record of the statement before the meeting

Each agenda item related to anticipated litigation shall only contain one such matter. For an anticipated litigation item that is anticipated based on Items #2, #3, or #5 above, the agenda item shall also include the facts or circumstances that might result in litigation, the claim or written threat of litigation, or the record of the threat. However, the agenda item shall not identify the alleged victim of unlawful or tortious sexual conduct or anyone making the threat on the alleged victim's behalf, or identify a public employee who is the alleged perpetrator of any unlawful or tortious conduct upon which a threat of litigation is based, unless the identity of the person has been publicly disclosed.  (Government Code 54956.9)

Existing Litigation

Based on the advice of its legal counsel, the Board may hold a closed session to confer with or receive advice from its legal counsel regarding existing litigation when discussion of the matter in open session would prejudice the District's position with respect to such litigation. Litigation is considered to be "existing" when the District has been named a party to the litigation or a District officer or employee has been named a party to the litigation based on prior or prospective activities or alleged activities during the course and scope of that office or employment, including litigation in which involves whether an activity is outside the course and scope of the office or employment. For this purpose, "litigation" means any adjudicatory proceeding, including eminent domain, before a court, administrative body exercising its adjudicatory authority, hearing officer, or arbitrator.  (Government Code 54956.9)

Tort, Public, or Workers' Compensation Liability

The Board may meet in closed session to discuss a claim for the payment of tort liability losses, public liability losses, or workers' compensation liability incurred by a joint powers agency (JPA) formed for the purpose of insurance pooling or self-insurance authority of which the District is a member.  (Government Code 54956.95)

Joint Powers Agency Issues

When the board of the JPA has so authorized and upon advice of District legal counsel, the Board may meet in closed session in order to receive, discuss, and take action concerning information that has direct financial or liability implications for the District and that was obtained in a closed session of a JPA of which the District is a member.

Review of Audit Report from California State Auditor's Office

Upon receipt of a confidential final draft audit report from the California State Auditor's Office and before the report has been made public, the Board may meet in closed session to discuss its response to that report.

Review of Assessment Instruments

The Board may meet in closed session to review the contents of any student assessment instrument approved or adopted for the statewide testing system.
