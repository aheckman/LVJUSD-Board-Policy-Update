## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board recognizes the importance of maintaining ongoing positive relations with employees and engaging in fair, respectful negotiations with employee organizations. The Board desires to reach agreement on employment contracts in a manner that prevents disruption to school operations and minimizes impact on student achievement.

The Board recognizes that advance planning is necessary to ensure that, in the event of a work stoppage, strike, or other concerted employee activity, students continue to receive educational services to which they are entitled. The Superintendent or designee shall develop a written plan which shall include strategies for the provision of internal and external communications, preservation of student and staff safety, maintenance of district operations, and appropriate student instruction and supervision during a work slowdown or stoppage.

CSBA NOTE: The Governing Board may extend the school year, if necessary, to make up for days lost during a work stoppage.  However, any extension of the school year that may impact represented employees' work year may be subject to bargaining with the employee organizations. 
Days of instruction lost due to a work stoppage may be made up following the end of the normal school year.

If an employee organization gives notice that it intends to strike, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the Public Employment Relations Board, Employment Development Department, employees in the striking unit, other district employees, parents/guardians, students, law enforcement, the media, and others as appropriate.

CSBA NOTE: Because the legality of strikes and strike conduct is dependent on the specific circumstances, reflected in the accompanying administrative regulation, the district should consult legal counsel before threatening or instituting discipline against an employee who has engaged in such activities. Also see BP/AR 4119.25/4219.25/4319.25 - Political Activities for information about permissible and prohibited political activities of employees and employee organizations.
Employees should be held accountable for their behavior during any labor dispute. The district may take disciplinary action against any employee who engages in an unlawful concerted action or in unlawful behavior in an otherwise protected activity, taking into account the seriousness of the behavior and the district's efforts to rebuild relations following the withholding of services by employees. 

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 3140-3142, (the Public Employee Health Protection Act), as added by AB 237 (Ch. 740, Statutes of 2021), prohibits California public employers, including school districts and county offices of education, from discontinuing or threatening to discontinue employer contributions for health care or other medical coverage for employees who, during an authorized strike, fall below the minimum work hours required to qualify for employee health care coverage.  An employer that violates this law may be required to restore any premiums, contributions, or out-of-pocket expenses paid by an employee as a result of the employer's violation.   
However, the district shall not discontinue or threaten to discontinue employer contributions for health care or other medical coverage for any employee or their enrolled dependents for the duration of the employee’s participation in an authorized strike, as defined in Government Code 3141 and specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.
