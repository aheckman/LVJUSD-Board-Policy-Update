## Policy Content

The Superintendent or designee shall provide safety devices and implement safeguards, methods, and processes that are reasonably necessary for the safety and health of employees in the workplace.  (Labor Code 6401)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Labor Code 6325, the Department of Industrial Relations Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) may prohibit entry into a place of employment when, in its opinion, the place of employment exposes employees to an imminent hazard. In such cases, Cal/OSHA will provide a notice that must be posted in a conspicuous place at the place of employment.
If the Department of Industrial Relations Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) prohibits entry into any district workplace or performance of a district operation or process based on a determination that the workplace exposes employees to the risk of an imminent hazard, including a machine, device, apparatus, or equipment that is in a dangerous condition or is dangerously placed, the Superintendent or designee shall post a notice of the hazard provided by Cal/OSHA in a conspicuous place at the work site. This notice shall not be removed except by an authorized representative of Cal/OSHA and only when the workplace, operation, or process is made safe, and the required safeguards, safety appliances, or devices are provided.  (Labor Code 6325)

A recognized or certified collective bargaining agent is, by definition, treated automatically as a designated representative.Districts are not required to include records of steps taken to implement and maintain the injury and illness prevention program. However, access to such information, or any other information in addition to that required by 8 CCR 3203, may be subject to collective bargaining.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide employees, or their representative designated pursuant to 8 CCR 3203, with either of the following:  (8 CCR 3203)

	Access to the district's injury and illness prevention program in a reasonable time, place, and manner, but in no event later than five business days after the request for access is received from an employee or a designated representative of the employee.
	
	When an employee or designated representative requests a copy of the district's injury and illness prevention program, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the requester a printed copy unless the employee or designated representative agrees to receive an electronic copy.
	
	The Superintendent or designee shall provide one printed copy free of charge. If the employee or designated representative requests additional copies within one year of the previous request and the district's injury and illness prevention program has not been updated with new information since the prior copy was provided, the district may charge reasonable reproduction costs pursuant to 8 CCR 3204 for the additional copies.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 8 CCR 3203, an employee has unobstructed access if, as part of the employee's regular work duties, the employee predictably and routinely uses the electronic means to communicate with management or coworkers.
	Unobstructed access to the district's injury and illness prevention program through the district's server or website that allows an employee to review, print, and email the current version of the district's injury and illness prevention program.

The Superintendent or designee shall communicate the right and procedure to access the district's injury and illness prevention program to all employees.  (8 CCR 3203)

Labor/Management Safety and Health Committee

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that choose to use a labor/management safety and health committee to comply with the requirements of 8 CCR 3203 regarding communication with employees as specified in Item #3 above in the section "Injury and Illness Prevention Program." Pursuant to 8 CCR 3203, if the committee adheres to the following practices, the district shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the communications requirements of the law.
The district's labor/management safety and health committee shall:  (8 CCR 3203)

	Meet regularly, but not less than quarterly.
	 
	Prepare and make available to affected employees written records of the safety and health issues discussed at committee meetings and maintained for review by Cal/OSHA upon request. These records shall be maintained for at least one year.
	 
	Review results of the periodic, scheduled worksite inspections.
	 
	Review investigations of occupational accidents and causes of incidents resulting in occupational injury or illness or exposure to hazardous substances. As appropriate, the committee may submit suggestions to the Superintendent or designee regarding the prevention of future incidents.
	 
	Review investigations of alleged hazardous conditions brought to the attention of any committee member. When determined necessary by the committee, it may conduct its own inspection and investigation to assist in remedial solutions.
	 
	Submit recommendations to assist in the evaluation of employee safety suggestions.
	 
	Upon request of Cal/OSHA, verify abatement action taken by the district to abate citations issued by Cal/OSHA.

Hearing Protection

Whenever employee noise exposure equals or exceeds the standards specified by law, the Superintendent or designee shall implement a hearing conservation program in accordance with state and federal regulations, including, when required, monitoring of sound levels, audiogram evaluation and audiometric testing of affected employees, the provision of hearing protectors, and employee training.  (8 CCR 5095-5100; 29 CFR 1910.95)

Eye Safety Devices

Employees shall wear eye safety devices whenever they are engaged in or observing an activity involving hazards or hazardous substances likely to cause eye injury.  (Education Code 32030-32034)

First Aid and Medical Services

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure the ready availability of medical personnel for advice and consultation on matters of industrial health or injury.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that suitable facilities for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes and body are provided within the work area for immediate emergency use when the eyes or body or any person may be exposed to injurious corrosive materials.  (8 CCR 3400)

CSBA NOTE: 8 CCR 3400 requires districts to make provisions in advance, using one or a combination of the provisions specified in Items #1-3 below, to ensure that employees receive prompt medical treatment for serious injury or illness. Districts should select the provision(s) that reflect district practice.
To avoid unnecessary delay in medical treatment in the event of an employee's serious injury or illness, the Superintendent or designee shall use one or more of the following:  (8 CCR 3400)

	A communication system for contacting a physician or emergency medical service, such as access to 911 or equivalent telephone system. The communication system or the employees using the system shall have the ability to direct emergency services to the location of the injured or ill employee.
	 
	Readily accessible and available on-site treatment facilities suitable for treatment of reasonably anticipated injury and illness
	 
	Proper equipment for prompt medical transport when transportation of injured or ill employees is necessary and appropriate
