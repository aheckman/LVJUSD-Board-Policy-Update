## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE:  The following optional policy and administrative regulation reflect the provisions of the federal Equal Access Act (20 USC 4071-4074) which prohibits discrimination against student groups because of the content of their speech, as specified below. The Act applies to districts with secondary schools, grades 9-12, that receive federal funds. The Equal Access Act does not address elementary schools; thus, elementary districts should revise or delete the following policy accordingly.
The Governing Board believes that student groups or clubs reinforce the instructional program, give students experience in civics and government, and provide social and recreational activities. Student groups also serve to honor outstanding student achievement and enhance school spirit and students' sense of belonging.  Prior to meeting on school grounds, all student groups shall be authorized by the principal or designee in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation.

CSBA NOTE: The extent to which a district may restrict the meetings of student groups depends on whether a district has created a "limited open forum" authorizing noncurriculum-related groups (e.g., the ski club) to meet on school premises during noninstructional time. See the accompanying administrative regulation for a definition of curriculum-related groups.Pursuant to 20 USC 4071, if a secondary school has created a "limited open forum" and allows any noncurriculum-related group to meet on school premises during noninstructional time, then the school must grant equal access to all other noncurriculum-related student groups and may not discriminate against such groups on the basis of the religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the group's speech. A district may create a "closed forum" by prohibiting all noncurriculum-related student groups from meeting on school grounds during noninstructional time. However, if a district permits any noncurriculum-related student groups to meet on school premises during noninstructional time, then, regardless of any policy to the contrary, it has created a "limited open forum."Option 1 below should be used by districts that have established a closed forum and Option 2 by districts that have created a limited open forum.
OPTION 1:  (Closed Forum )

In order to maintain a closed forum on school campuses, only student-initiated groups that relate directly to the curriculum shall be allowed to meet on school premises during noninstructional time.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph allows curriculum-related student groups within a closed forum to use the school media to announce meetings.
All curriculum-related student clubs or groups shall have equal access to the school media to announce meetings, including, but not limited to, the public address system, the school newspaper, the school bulletin board, and school web site.

Noncurriculum-related student groups are subject to the requirements specified in Board policy and administrative regulation for community groups regarding the use of district facilities for meetings and the right to distribute materials to students.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Limited Open Forum)

CSBA NOTE:  The remainder of this policy applies to districts that have created a limited open forum.
The Board encourages students to pursue interests and clubs which may not directly relate to the district's curriculum and, to that end, has created a limited open forum.

All student-initiated groups shall be given equal access to meet on school premises during noninstructional time without regard to their religious, political, philosophical, or other speech content.  The Board shall ensure that:  (20 USC 4071, 4072)

	 The meeting shall be voluntary and student-initiated.
	 
	 There shall be no sponsorship of the meeting by the school or staff.  The term sponsorship means that school staff are promoting, leading, or participating in a meeting.  The assignment of a teacher, administrator, or other school employee to a meeting for custodial purposes shall not constitute sponsorship of the meeting.
	 
	 Employees of the school shall be present at religious meetings only in a nonparticipatory capacity.
	 
	 The meeting shall not materially and substantially interfere with the orderly conduct of educational activities within the school.


CSBA NOTE:  In Student Coalition for Peace v. Lower Merion School, the court clarified that, if the school's limited open forum allows nonstudent participation in curriculum-related student groups, then noncurriculum-related student groups must be granted the same right, as long as the nonstudents do not "direct, conduct, or regularly attend" such activities, as prohibited by 20 USC 4071.


	 Nonschool persons shall not direct, conduct, control, or regularly attend activities of student groups.

CSBA NOTE: In Prince v. Jacoby, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a district with a limited open forum that allowed certain noncurriculum-related student groups to use school media to publicize meetings was required to provide equal access to all noncurriculum-related student groups, including religious groups. Thus, a student bible club must be granted the same access to school media to announce meeting times and locations. In addition, Education Code 48907 grants students freedom of speech and of the press including, but not limited to, the use of bulletin boards; the distribution of printed materials or petitions; the wearing of buttons, badges, and other insignia; and the right of expression in official publications, subject to reasonable provisions for the time, place, and manner in which free expression may take place. See BP/AR 5145.2 - Freedom of Speech/Expression for language reflecting the requirements of Education Code 48907.
All student clubs or groups shall have equal access to the school media to announce meetings, including the public address system, the school newspaper, bulletin boards, and school web site. However, the principal or designee may issue a disclaimer that such activities are not school-sponsored.

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 4071 prohibits districts from expending public funds beyond the incidental cost of providing space for student-initiated meetings. In Prince v. Jacoby, the court held that a district must grant a noncurriculum-related bible club the same access to student body funds, the yearbook, audio/visual equipment, and supplies as the district provides to other noncurriculum-related groups.
All noncurriculum-related student groups shall be given equal access to meeting space, school equipment, and supplies. 

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 7905 prohibits any district that has designated a limited open forum and that receives funds from the U.S. Department of Education from denying equal access to any group affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America or other patriotic youth group listed in 36 USC 20101-240112. The state Civic Center Act (Education Code 38130-38138) has long authorized the use of school facilities by the Boy Scouts. See BP/AR 1330 - Use of School Facilities.
No school shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet, or otherwise discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, or with any other youth group listed as a patriotic society in Title 36 of the United States Code, for reasons based on the membership or leadership criteria or oath of allegiance to God and country.  (20 USC 7905)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE
