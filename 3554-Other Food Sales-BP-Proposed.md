## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that sales of foods and beverages at school during the school day should be aligned with the District's goals to promote student wellness.  Any food sales conducted outside the District's food service program shall meet nutritional standards specified in law, Board policy, and administrative regulation and shall not reduce student participation in the District's food service program.

The Board authorizes the Superintendent or designee to approve the sale of foods and beverages outside the District's food service program, including sales by student or school-connected organizations, sales through vending machines, and/or sales at secondary school student stores for fundraising purposes.

When vending machines are sponsored by the District or a student or adult organization, the Superintendent or designee shall determine how and where vending machines may be placed at school sites, District offices, or other school facilities.
