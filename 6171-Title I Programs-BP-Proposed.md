## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide a high-quality education that enables all students to meet challenging state academic standards. In schools with a large number or percentage of economically disadvantaged families, the District shall use Title I funds to provide services that strengthen the academic program and provide support to students at risk of failing to achieve academic standards.

Title I funds shall be used to supplement, not supplant, funds available from state and local sources for the education of students participating in Title I programs.  (20 USC 6314, 6321)

Descriptions of how the District will address the required components of the Title I local educational agency plan, as specified in 20 USC 6312, shall be included within the District's control and accountability plan (LCAP), the LCAP Federal Addendum, or another document. School-level strategies shall be aligned with the District's plan and be tailored to the specific needs of the students at the school.

In addition, the District and each school receiving Title I funds shall develop a written parent/guardian and family engagement policy in accordance with 20 USC 6318.

Comparability of Services

In schools receiving Title I funds, state and local funds shall be used to provide services that, taken as a whole, are at least comparable to services in schools that are not receiving Title I funds or, if all District schools are receiving Title I funds, that are substantially comparable in each school. Comparability may be determined on a school-by-school basis or by grade span.  (20 USC 6321)

To demonstrate comparability of services among District schools, the District shall:


	Adopt and implement a Districtwide salary schedule
	 
	Ensure equivalence in teachers, administrators, and other staff, as measured by either or both of the following:
	 
	
		The ratio of students to instructional staff at each Title I school within a grade span, which shall not exceed 110 percent of the average ratio for all non-Title I District schools within that grade span
		 
		Salary expenditures for instructional staff at each Title I school, which shall be no less than 90 percent of the average salary expenditure across non-Title I District schools.
		 
	
	
	Ensure equivalence in the provision of curriculum materials and instructional supplies, by determining whether the per-student expenditure of state and local funds for curriculum materials and instructional supplies in Title I schools is between 90 and 110 percent of the District wide average
	 
	Determine whether the amount of state and local funds allocated per student for each grade span is between 90 and 110 percent of the per student average for each grade span in non-Title I schools

In determining comparability, the District shall not include staff salary differentials for years of employment. The District also may exclude unpredictable changes in student enrollment or personnel assignments that occur after the beginning of the school year, state and local funds expended for language instruction educational programs, state and local funds expended for the excess costs of providing services to students with disabilities, and supplemental state or local funds expended in any school attendance area or school for programs that specifically meet the intent and purposes of Title I.  (20 USC 6321)

The Superintendent or designee shall annually assess comparability in accordance with the above criteria and maintain records documenting the District's compliance.  If any instances of noncomparability are identified, the Superintendent or designee shall promptly implement adjustments as needed to ensure comparability.

Participation of Private School Students

The District shall provide or contract to provide special educational services, instructional services (including evaluations to determine the progress being made in meeting students' academic needs), counseling, mentoring, one-on-one tutoring, or other Title I benefits to eligible private school students residing in a participating school attendance area. Such services and benefits shall be provided on an equitable basis in comparison to services and other benefits for public school students.  (20 USC 6320, 7881)

Program Evaluation

The Board shall regularly monitor the progress of economically disadvantaged and low-achieving students in Title I schools. During the annual evaluation of the District's progress toward achieving each goal identified in the LCAP or other planning document addressing 20 USC 6312, the Board shall review disaggregated data on academic achievement, school attendance, and other outcomes for such students and shall ensure that strategies are revised as necessary to support continuous improvement.
