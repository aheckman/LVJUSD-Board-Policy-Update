## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation specifies minimum and maximum school days for each grade level as provided by law. The district may revise this regulation to reflect district practice.Pursuant to Education Code 46114, the minimum school day in grades K-8 may be computed by determining the average number of minutes over 10 consecutive school days (i.e., the number of minutes of attendance in any 10 consecutive school days, divided by 10). Education Code 46142 authorizes the minimum school day in junior high and high schools to be computed by averaging the number of minutes over two consecutive school days. The district will be in compliance if the average is at least the minimum day required by law, even if the number of minutes in any one school day is less than the minimum required school day specified below. However, Education Code 46114 and 46142 provide that no single school day may be less than 60 minutes for kindergarten, 170 minutes for grades 1-3, or 180 minutes for grades 4-12.Education Code 46201 and 46207 require districts that have reached their local control funding formula (LCFF) funding target, as well as districts that received longer day or longer year funding prior to the implementation of the LCFF, to offer at least the following instructional minutes per school year: 36,000 minutes for kindergarten, 50,400 for grades 1-3, 54,000 for grades 4-8, and 64,800 for grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code 46201 and 46207, if this requirement is not met for any grade level, a portion of the district's LCFF allocation will be withheld.
Kindergarten/Transitional Kindergarten

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that maintain kindergarten and transitional kindergarten (TK) classes. Education Code 37202 permits districts to maintain kindergarten or TK classes for different lengths of time during the school day, either at the same or different school sites. Districts offering kindergarten or TK classes for different lengths of time are still required to meet the minimum and maximum length of school day described below.
Kindergarten and transitional kindergarten (TK) classes in district schools may be maintained for different lengths of time, either at the same or different school sites.  (Education Code 37202)

CSBA NOTE:  Education Code 46117 establishes a minimum school day of three hours (180 minutes) for kindergarten students. However, pursuant to Education Code 46119, if a district has fewer than 40 kindergarten students, the Governing Board may apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction to maintain two kindergarten classes of 150 minutes each, including recesses, taught on the same day by the same teacher.
The average school day for kindergarten and TK students shall be at least three hours, including recesses but excluding noon intermissions. If fewer than 40 students are enrolled in kindergarten classes, the district may request approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to maintain two kindergarten classes of 150 minutes each.  (Education Code 46114, 46115, 46117, 46119)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 46111 limits the maximum length of the school day for kindergarten to four hours, not counting recesses, except where the school is operating an early primary program pursuant to Education Code 8970-8974 or an expanded learning opportunity program established pursuant to Education Code 46120.
In any school day, kindergarten and/or TK students shall not be kept in school for longer than four hours, excluding recesses, except where the school is operating an early primary program pursuant to Education Code 8970-8974 or an expanded learning opportunity program pursuant to Education Code 46120.  (Education Code 46111, 46115, 46120)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that have established an early primary program pursuant to Education Code 8970-8974 in order to provide an integrated, experiential, and developmentally appropriate educational program with specified components for students in prekindergarten through grade 3. Education Code 8973 provides that the kindergarten school day in such programs may exceed four hours under the conditions described below, although districts do not receive additional apportionment funds for the excess time.
In any district school operating an early primary program pursuant to Education Code 8970-8974, the kindergarten school day may exceed four hours, excluding recess, if both of the following conditions are met:  (Education Code 8973)

	The Governing Board has declared that the extended-day kindergarten program does not exceed the length of the primary school day
	 
	The extended-day kindergarten program includes ample opportunity for both active and quiet activities within an integrated, experiential, and developmentally appropriate educational program

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Although Education Code 46111 provides that recess shall be excluded from determining the maximum school day, it is the interpretation of the California Department of Education (CDE) that recess time may be counted as instructional minutes, at the district's discretion, if teacher supervision occurs.
Under an extended day kindergarten program, recess may be counted as instructional minutes for purposes of determining the maximum school day if it occurs under teacher supervision.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that maintain multitrack year-round schools pursuant to Education Code 37670.
In any multitrack year-round school operating pursuant to Education Code 37670, the kindergarten school day may be up to 265 minutes, excluding recesses.  (Education Code 46111)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48003, districts are required to provide an annual report to CDE regarding the type of kindergarten program offered by the district, including part day, full day, or both, by completing the School Information Form 2017 located on CDE's website. The form also includes the type(s) of TK program offered.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the California Department of Education as to whether the district's kindergarten and TK programs are offered full day, part day, or both.  (Education Code 48003)

Grades 1-8

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that maintain any of grades 1-8 and should be modified to reflect the grade levels offered by the district.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the school day for elementary and middle school students shall be:

	At least 230 minutes for students in grades 1-3, unless the Board has prescribed a shorter school day because of lack of school facilities requiring double sessions, in which case the minimum school day shall be 200 minutes  (Education Code 46112)
	 
	At least 240 minutes for students in grades 4-8  (Education Code 46113, 46142)

In determining the number of minutes for purposes of compliance with the minimum school day for students in grades 1-8, both noon intermissions and recesses shall be excluded.  (Education Code 46115)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for any district maintaining a middle school, except a rural school district. Pursuant to Education Code 46148, the school day for a middle school is required to begin no earlier than 8:00 am.
The school day for a middle school shall begin no earlier than 8:00 a.m.  (Education Code 46148)

Grades 9-12

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that maintain any of grades 9-12 and may be modified to reflect the grade levels offered by the district.
The school day for a high school shall begin no earlier than 8:30 a.m.  (Education Code 46148)

CSBA NOTE: In its, "Frequently Asked Questions," about attendance accounting and instructional time for independent study, CDE has clarified that the same minimum school day requirements apply to independent study as for students attending in-person instruction; for more information regarding instructional minutes as they relate to independent study, see BP/AR 6158 - Independent Study.
The school day for students in grades 9-12, including students in the independent study program, shall be at least 240 minutes.  (Education Code 46141, 46142)

CSBA NOTE: The following list should be revised to reflect programs offered by the district.
However, the school day may be less than 240 minutes when authorized by law. Programs that have a minimum school day of 180 minutes include, but are not necessarily limited to:

	Continuation high school or classes  (Education Code 46141, 46170)
	 
	Opportunity school or classes  (Education Code 46141, 46180)
	 
	Regional occupational center  (Education Code 46141, 52325)
	 
	Work experience education program approved pursuant to Education Code 51760-51769.5  (Education Code 46141, 46144)
	
	A student in grade 12 who is enrolled in work experience education and is in the last semester or quarter before graduation may, upon written request by the student's parent/guardian or the student, if 18 years of age or over, be permitted to attend school for less than 180 minutes per school day if all requirements for graduation would be completed, except physical education courses, in less than 180 minutes each day.  (Education Code 46147)
	 
	Concurrent enrollment in a community college pursuant to Education Code 48800-48802 or, for students in grades 11-12, part-time enrollment in classes of the California State University or University of California, provided academic credit will be awarded upon satisfactory completion of enrolled courses  (Education Code 46146)
	 
	An early college high school or middle college high school, provided the students are enrolled in community college or college classes in accordance with Item #5 above (Education Code 46141, 46146.5)
	 
	Special day or Saturday vocational training program conducted under a federally approved plan for career technical education  (Education Code 46141, 46144)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that operate an evening high school pursuant to Education Code 51720-51724.
For an evening high school operated pursuant to Education Code 51720-51724, the number of days, specific days of the week, and number of hours during which the program shall be in session may be determined by the Board.  (Education Code 46141, 51721)

Students in grade 12 shall be enrolled in at least five courses each semester or the equivalent number of courses each quarter. This requirement shall not apply to students enrolled in regional occupational centers or programs, courses at accredited postsecondary institutions, independent study, special education programs in which the student's individualized education program establishes a different number of courses, continuation education classes, work experience education programs, or any other course of study authorized by the Board that is equivalent to the approved high school course of study.  (Education Code 46145)

Alternative Block Schedule for Secondary Schools

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that choose to create a block schedule pursuant to Education Code 46160-46162; for information regarding actions required prior to implementing a block or alternative schedule, see the accompanying Board policy. In establishing a block schedule, the district should be aware of state law (Education Code 51222) that requires secondary students to attend physical education courses for at least 400 minutes each 10 school days; for more information regarding instructional minutes as it relates to physical education, see AR 6142.7 - Physical Education and Activity. Although the daily alternating block schedule, often referred to as the A/B block schedule, does fulfill the requirement for physical education minutes, other block schedules do not and thus require a waiver from the State Board of Education (SBE); see SBE Waiver Policy #99-03 for waiver criteria.
In order to establish a block or other alternative schedule or to accommodate career technical education and regional occupational center/program courses, the district may authorize students to attend fewer than the total number of days in which school is in session provided that students attend classes for at least 1,200 minutes during any five school day period or 2,400 minutes during any 10 school day period.  (Education Code 46160)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that maintain an early college high school or middle college high school. Pursuant to Education Code 46160 such districts may schedule classes in these schools so that students who satisfy the provisions of Education Code 46146.5 in regard to part-time enrollment at community college, the California State University, or the University of California attend classes for at least 900 minutes during any five-school day period or 1,800 minutes during any 10-school day period.
An early college high school or middle college high school may be scheduled so that students attend classes for at least 900 minutes during any five-school day period or 1,800 minutes during any 10-school day period.  (Education Code 46160)
