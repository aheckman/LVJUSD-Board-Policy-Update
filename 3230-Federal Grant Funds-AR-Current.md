## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation reflects the major requirements of the Office of Management and Budget's Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (commonly called "Uniform Guidance"), as specified in 2 CFR 200.0-200.521 and Appendices I-XII, as amended by 85 Fed. Reg. 49506.  The Uniform Guidance governs the use of all grants awarded by the federal government, including formula grants (e.g., Title I funding, Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) and discretionary grants. Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.302, 200.318, and 200.319, the district is mandated to adopt written procedures related to procurement, conflict of interest, cash management, payments, and allowable costs.Pursuant to Public Contract Code 20111, districts participating in a federally funded child nutrition program, such as the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program, must comply with the federal procurement standards of 2 CFR 200.318-200.326.The requirements of the Uniform Guidance are extensive and are not fully covered in the following administrative regulation.  It is recommended that the district expand the following regulation and/or maintain a comprehensive procedures manual which contains internal controls and grant management standards used by the district to ensure the lawful expenditure of federal funds, including, but not limited to, procedures and protocols for cash management, procurement, inventory management, allowability of expenditures, "time and effort" reporting by personnel, and record retention.
To ensure the lawful expenditure of any federal formula or discretionary grant funds awarded to the district, the Superintendent or designee shall comply with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget's Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (the "Uniform Guidance"), as contained in 2 CFR 200.0-200.521 and Appendices I-XII.

Allowable Costs

CSBA NOTE: 2 CFR 200.302 mandates that districts develop written procedures for determining the allowability of costs in accordance with 2 CFR 200.400-200.475 and the terms and conditions of the federal grant award. Districts may revise this section or their detailed procedures manual to reflect those requirements.
Prior to obligating or spending any federal grant funds, the Superintendent or designee shall determine whether a proposed purchase is an allowable expenditure in accordance with 2 CFR 200.400-200.475 and the terms and conditions of the award.  The Superintendent or designee shall also determine whether the expense is a direct or indirect cost as defined in 2 CFR 200.413 and 200.414 and, if the purchase will benefit other programs not included in the grant award, the appropriate share to be allocated to the federal grant.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 42126, which requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to prescribe a uniform format for district budgets, districts are required to use the Standardized Account Code Structure (SACS). SACS ensures that districts meet state and federal reporting guidelines and comply with generally accepted accounting principles prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.  The California Department of Education's California School Accounting Manual provides guidance regarding coding of revenues and expenditures and reflects the Uniform Guidance.
The Superintendent or designee shall review and approve all transactions involving federal grant funds and shall ensure the proper coding of expenditures consistent with the California School Accounting Manual.

Period of Performance

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.344, any federal funds that are not obligated or paid within the appropriate timeframes must be returned to the awarding agency. Thus, districts should closely monitor spending throughout the grant cycle.As amended by 85 Fed. Reg. 49506, 2 CFR 200.344 increases the number of days for districts to liquidate all financial obligations from 90 days to 120 days.
All obligations of federal funds shall occur on or between the beginning and ending dates of the grant project and shall be paid no later than 120 calendar days after the end of the funding period, unless specifically authorized by the grant award to be carried over beyond the initial term of the grant.  (2 CFR 200.77, 200.308, 200.309, 200.344)

Procurement

CSBA NOTE: Districts are required to comply with the procurement standards specified in 2 CFR 200.317-200.327 as well as state laws pertaining to bidding and procurement.2 CFR 200.322, as added by 85 Fed. Reg. 49506, requires districts, to the extent practicable under a federal award, to give preference to the purchase, acquisition, or use of goods, products, or materials from the United States.
When procuring goods and services with a federal grant, the Superintendent or designee shall comply with the standards contained in 2 CFR 200.317-200.327 and Appendix II of Part 200, and with any applicable state bidding or procurement law or district policy that is more restrictive.

As appropriate to encourage greater economy and efficiency, the Superintendent or designee shall avoid acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items, give consideration to consolidating or breaking out procurements, analyze lease versus purchase alternatives, consider entering into an interagency agreement for procurement of common or shared goods and services, and/or use federal excess or surplus property.  (2 CFR 200.318)

CSBA NOTE: 2 CFR 200.318 mandates that districts have written procedures that address all applicable laws regarding the use of federal grant funds in procurement transactions. The U.S. Department of Education's (USDOE) Questions and Answers Regarding 2 CFR Part 200 clarifies that such procedures must address issues related to the bid process (e.g., source evaluation, protests, and claims).The following list reflects major requirements contained in the Uniform Guidance.  Districts may revise the following list or the district's comprehensive procedures manual to include additional detail, such as a description of the documents that will be used (e.g., purchase order, requisition), staff responsibilities, and the process for soliciting and receiving bids.
The procurement of goods or services with federal funds shall be conducted in a manner that provides full and open competition in accordance with state laws and district regulations and the following requirements:

CSBA NOTE: 2 CFR 200.67 and 200.320 permit districts to establish simplified procurement procedures for "micro-purchases," as described in item #1 below.  Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.320, districts are responsible for determining and documenting an appropriate micro-purchase threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and district procurement procedures.  Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.320, as amended by 85 Fed. Reg. 49506, and 48 CFR 2.101, the threshold for such purchases cannot exceed $10,000 except as otherwise specified, and will be periodically adjusted for inflation.  However, pursuant to 2 CFR 200.320, as amended, a district may be eligible to establish a micro-purchase threshold up to $50,000 on an annual basis if the district is able to self-certify that it may do so, with documentation of one of the following criteria:  (1) the district's qualification as a low-risk auditee in accordance with 2 CFR 200.520; (2) an annual internal institutional risk assessment to identify, mitigate, and manage financial risks; or (3) a higher threshold consistent with state law.  Districts may establish a threshold higher than $50,000 with approval of the appropriate federal agency.  Item #1 may be revised to reflect the threshold established by the district.Use of the simplified procedures requires that the district determine the price to be "reasonable." According to the USDOE's Questions and Answers Regarding 2 CFR Part 200, a documented review of web sites would meet this requirement.As amended, 2 CFR 200.320 increases the "small purchases" limit under the Uniform Guidance (item #2 below) to $250,000 in accordance with 48 CFR 2.101. However, the more restrictive California bid limits in Public Contract Code 20111 and district procurement policies must be applied to define the "small purchase" requirements.Any purchases above the California bid limits must follow California law. See BP/AR 3311 - Bids for more information regarding bids and bid limits.

	Any purchase of supplies or services that does not exceed the "micro-purchase" threshold established by the district in accordance with 48 CFR 2.101 may be awarded without soliciting competitive quotes, provided that the district considers the price to be reasonable and maintains written evidence of this reasonableness in the record of all micro-purchases.  (2 CFR 200.67, 200.320)
	 
	For any purchase that exceeds the micro-purchase threshold but is less than the bid limit required by Public Contract Code 20111, the Superintendent or designee shall utilize "small-purchase" procedures that include obtaining price or rate quotes from an adequate number of qualified sources.  (2 CFR 200.320)
	 
	Contracts for goods or services over the bid limits required by Public Contract Code 20111 shall be awarded pursuant to California law and AR 3311 - Bids, unless exempt from bidding under the law.
	 
	If a purchase is exempt from bidding and the district's solicitation is by a request for proposals, the award may be made by either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract awarded to the entity whose proposal is most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered.  (2 CFR 200.320)
	 
	Procurement by noncompetitive proposals (sole sourcing) may be used only when the item is available exclusively from a single source, the need or emergency will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation, the awarding agency expressly authorizes sole sourcing in response to the district's request, and/or competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources.  (2 CFR 200.320)
	 
	Time and materials type contracts may be used only after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.  Time and materials type contract means a contract for which the cost is the sum of the actual cost of materials and direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that reflect wages, general administrative expenses, and profit.  (2 CFR 200.318)


CSBA NOTE: 2 CFR 200.214 restricts districts from procuring goods or services from entities that have been debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from participation in federal assistance programs or activities. Districts may require certification of eligibility from the vendor or use the federal System for Award Management website to determine whether a particular entity has been excluded.
For any purchase of $25,000 or more, the Superintendent or designee shall verify that any vendor which is used to procure goods or services is not excluded or disqualified by the federal government.  (2 CFR 180.220, 200.214)

CSBA NOTE: 2 CFR 200.319 mandates that districts have written procedures for procurement transactions that include the following components.
All solicitations shall incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description shall avoid detailed product specifications to the extent possible, but may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product, or service to be procured and, when necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. When it is impractical or not economical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a brand name or equivalent description may be used to define the performance or other salient requirements of procurement, clearly stating the specific features of the named brand which must be met by offers. In addition, every solicitation shall identify all requirements which the offer must fulfill and any other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.  (2 CFR 200.319)

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain sufficient records to document the procurement, including, but not limited to, the rationale for the method of procurement, selection of the contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.  (2 CFR 200.318)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all contracts for purchases using federal grant funds contain the applicable contract provisions described in Appendix II to Part 200 - Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards.  (2 CFR 200.327)

Capital Expenditures

CSBA NOTE: 2 CFR 200.313 and 200.439 require a district receiving federal grant funds to obtain prior written approval from the awarding agency before incurring the cost of a capital expenditure, as defined in 2 CFR 200.12 and 200.13. See AR 3512 - Equipment for further information about requirements related to equipment purchased with federal funds, including labeling, maintenance, and inventory of the equipment and continued use of the equipment after the program ceases to be supported by federal funds.
The Superintendent or designee shall obtain prior written approval from the awarding agency before using federal funds to make capital expenditures, including the acquisition of land, facilities, equipment, and intellectual property and expenditures to make additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations, or alterations to capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life.  (2 CFR 200.313, 200.439)

Conflict of Interest

CSBA NOTE: 2 CFR 200.318 mandates that districts maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and the actions of employees engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts.  The district's standards of conduct must also provide for disciplinary actions to be applied when officers, employees, or representatives of the district violate conflict of interest standards. The district should revise this section or its detailed procedures manual to reflect district practice.
Governing Board members, district employees, and other district representatives shall not participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by federal funds if they have a real or apparent conflict of interest, such as when they or a member of their immediate family, their partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of them has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a firm considered for a contract.  Such persons are prohibited from soliciting or accepting gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or subcontractors unless the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value.  (2 CFR 200.318)

Employees engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts shall also comply with BB 9270 - Conflict of Interest.

Persons involved in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by federal funds shall be subject to discipline for any violation of conflict of interest standards.  (2 CFR 200.318)

Cash Management

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.302, districts are mandated to develop written procedures to implement the requirements of 2 CFR 200.305.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure the district's compliance with 2 CFR 200.305 pertaining to payments and cash management, including compliance with applicable methods and procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the district and the district's disbursement of funds.  (2 CFR 200.305)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.305, a district may be paid in advance by the awarding agency if it maintains written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the district as well as financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in the Uniform Guidance.
When authorized by law, the district may receive advance payments of federal grant funds, limited to the minimum amounts needed and timed in accordance with the actual immediate cash requirements of the district for carrying out the purpose of the program or project.

Except under specified conditions, the district shall maintain the advance payments in an interest-bearing account. The district shall remit interest earned on the advanced payment to the awarding agency on an annual basis, but may retain interest amounts specified in 2 CFR 200.305 for administrative expenses.  (2 CFR 200.305)

When required by the awarding agency, the district shall instead submit a request for reimbursement of actual expenses incurred. The district may also request reimbursement as an alternative to receiving advance payments.  (2 CFR 200.305)

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain source documentation supporting the expenditure of federal funds, such as invoices, time sheets, payroll stubs, or other appropriate documentation.

Personnel

CSBA NOTE: In order to charge staff compensation as an allowable expense of federal grant funds pursuant to 2 CFR 200.430, employees must document the amount of time they spend on grant activities supported by federal funds. These documents, known as "time and effort" records, are used to charge the costs of personnel compensation to federal grants. It is recommended that the district's administrative regulation reflect district practice for documenting time and effort, such as the type of documentation maintained, signature requirements, how often certifications will be completed, and review of the records by a supervisor.
All district employees who are paid in full or in part with federal funds shall document the amount of time they spend on grant activities.  Such records shall be incorporated into the official records of the district and shall be subject to a system of internal controls which provides reasonable assurance that the charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated in accordance with 2 CFR 200.430.  (2 CFR 200.430)

Salaries and wages of employees whose salary is paid with state or local funds but are used to meet a cost-sharing or matching requirement of the federal grant shall be documented in the same manner as salaries and wages claimed for reimbursement under a federal grant.  (2 CFR 200.430)

Records

Except as otherwise provided in 2 CFR 200.334, or where state law or district policy requires a longer retention period, financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other district records related to a federal award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for a federal award that is renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report.  (2 CFR 200.334)

Audits

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.501, districts that expend $750,000 or more in federal grant funds during a fiscal year must have a single audit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR 200.514, unless it chooses to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR 200.507. Districts that expend more than $50 million in federal funds are subject to the requirements specified in 2 CFR 200.513. District audits are also subject to the requirements in Education Code 41020, the state Education Audit Appeal Panel's Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, and the California Department of Education Audit Guide. See BP/AR 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability for further information about audit requirements.Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.501, districts that expend less than $750,000 in federal grant funds per fiscal year are exempt from federal audit requirements but must make records available for review or audit by the awarding agency, the pass-through entity, and U.S. Government Accountability Office. Such districts may delete the following section.
Whenever the district expends $750,000 or more in federal grant funds during a fiscal year, it shall arrange for either a single audit or a program-specific audit in accordance with 2 CFR 200.507 or 200.514.  (2 CFR 200.501)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the audit meets the requirements specified in 2 CFR 200.500-200.521.

Specified records pertaining to the audit of federal funds expended by the district shall be transmitted to the clearinghouse designated by the federal Office of Management and Budget and shall be made available for public inspection. Such records shall be transmitted within 30 days after receipt of the auditor's report or within nine months after the end of the audit period, whichever is sooner, unless a longer period is agreed to in advance by the federal agency or a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide.  (2 CFR 200.512)

In the event that the audit identifies any deficiency, the Superintendent or designee shall promptly act to either correct the identified deficiency, produce recommended improvements, or demonstrate that the audit finding is invalid or does not warrant action.  (2 CFR 200.26, 200.508, 200.511)
