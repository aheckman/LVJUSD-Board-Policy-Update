## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article 1, Section 2 of the California Constitution guarantee freedom of speech and of the press. Court cases and California law have addressed the application of these principles in a school setting and have established parameters for student expression. The following policy addresses rights and limitations related to student expression in a variety of forms, including off-campus as well as on-campus student expression.
The Governing Board believes that free inquiry and exchange of ideas are essential parts of a democratic education. The Board respects students' rights to express ideas and opinions, take stands on issues, and support causes, even when such speech is controversial or unpopular.

On-Campus Expression

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48907 mandates districts to establish a written "publications code" related to students' rights to freedom of speech and of the press. These written rules and regulations must include reasonable provisions for the time, place, and manner in which free expression may take place within the district's jurisdiction. See the accompanying administrative regulation for further language implementing this mandate. It is recommended that districts consult legal counsel when adopting and implementing policy related to freedom of speech/expression.
Students shall have the right to exercise freedom of speech and of the press including, but not limited to, the use of bulletin boards; the distribution of printed materials or petitions; the wearing of buttons, badges, and other insignia; and the right of expression in official publications.  (Education Code 48907)

Student expression on district or school Internet web sites and online media shall generally be afforded the same protections as in print media.

CSBA NOTE: Numerous court decisions have found that the First Amendment rights of public school students are not necessarily the same as the rights of adults in other settings and must be applied in light of the special circumstances of the school environment. In Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that when a school has not, by policy or practice, opened up a school-sponsored activity for unrestricted use by students, the school may limit student expression as long as its decision is reasonably related to "legitimate pedagogical concerns." In California, Education Code 48907 grants students broader rights of freedom of press and provides that student content can be restrained only when it is obscene, libelous or slanderous, or incites students to commit unlawful acts, violate school rules, or substantially disrupt school operations.When determining what type of content might be restrained, the courts have found age to be a critical factor (Hazelwood and Bethel v. Fraser). Although the courts have not specifically addressed the speech rights of elementary students, it appears that schools have greater authority to limit speech that could harm elementary students' emotional, moral, social, and intellectual development. (Muller v. Jefferson Lighthouse School)
Students' freedom of expression shall be limited only as allowed by Education Code 48907, 48950, and other applicable state and federal laws.

Students are prohibited from making any expressions or distributing or posting any materials that are obscene, libelous, or slanderous. Students also are prohibited from making any expressions that so incites students as to create a clear and present danger of the commission of unlawful acts on school premises, the violation of school rules, or substantial disruption of the school's orderly operation.  (Education Code 48907)

CSBA NOTE: The U.S. Supreme Court has held that "fighting words," which by their very utterance can cause an immediate breach of the peace, are not constitutionally protected.
The use of "fighting words" or epithets is prohibited in those instances where the speech is abusive and insulting, rather than a communication of ideas, and the speech is used in an abusive manner in a situation that presents an actual danger that it will cause a breach of the peace.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48907 and 48950 specify that an employee may not be dismissed, suspended, disciplined, reassigned, transferred, or otherwise retaliated solely for action to protect a student free speech and press rights. See AR 4118 - Dismissal/Suspension/Disciplinary Action.
School officials shall not engage in prior restraint of material prepared for official school publications except insofar as the content of the material violates the law.  (Education Code 48907)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that maintain one or more high schools. Education Code 48950 provides that no district maintaining high schools shall make or enforce any rule subjecting a high school student to disciplinary sanctions solely on the basis of speech or other communication that would be constitutionally protected if engaged in outside of campus. Students enrolled in a school that makes or enforces such a rule may take civil action for injunctive and declaratory relief.
The Superintendent or designee shall not discipline any high school student solely on the basis of speech or other communication that would be constitutionally protected when engaged in outside of school, but may impose discipline for harassment, threats, or intimidation unless constitutionally protected.  (Education Code 48950)

Off-Campus Expression

CSBA NOTE: Courts have generally found that schools may impose discipline for off-campus conduct that poses a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or school property or disrupts the educational program, provided that the district is able to document the impact or disruption that the conduct had, or could be expected to have, on campus. In addition, courts have analyzed the reasonableness of the district's policy and whether the disciplinary action taken by the district was in proportion to the student's misbehavior. See also BP 5131 - Conduct.In Lavine v. Blaine School District, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals applied Tinker v. Des Moines School District to conclude that a school district in Washington was justified in expelling a student whose off-campus poetry, when considered in the totality of other relevant factors, indicated he might pose a danger to himself or others. Similar standards have been applied with regard to students' off-campus Internet web sites. The federal courts in Beussink v. Woodland R-IV School District and Emmett v. Kirkland School District No. 415 confirmed that student off-campus Internet speech merits First Amendment protection and that disliking the content of a student's speech critical of the schools and staff is not an acceptable justification for limiting student speech.Since this area of law is unclear and constantly evolving, it is strongly recommended that districts consult with legal counsel when developing policy and prior to applying discipline for off-campus speech.
A student shall be subject to discipline for off-campus expression, including expression on off-campus Internet web sites, when such expression poses a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or school property, or substantially disrupts the educational program.  The Superintendent or designee shall document the impact the expression had or could be expected to have on the school program.
