## Policy Content

In order to protect all employees from contact with potentially infectious blood or other body fluids, the Board of Education requires that universal precautions be observed throughout the District.  Universal precautions are appropriate for preventing the spread of all infectious diseases and shall be used regardless of whether bloodborne pathogens are known to be present.

The Superintendent or designee shall distribute to employees information provided by the California Department of Education (CDE) regarding acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS-related conditions, and hepatitis B.  This information shall include, but not be limited to, any appropriate methods employees may use to prevent exposure to AIDS and hepatitis B, including information concerning the availability of a vaccine to prevent contraction of hepatitis B, and that the cost of this vaccination may be covered by the health plan of the employees.  Information shall be distributed annually, or more frequently if there is new information supplied by CDE.  (Health and Safety Code 120875, 120880)

Employees shall immediately report any exposure incident or first aid incident in accordance with the District's exposure control plan for bloodborne pathogens or other safety procedures.
