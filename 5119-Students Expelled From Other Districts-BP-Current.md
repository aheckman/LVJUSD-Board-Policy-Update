## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is optional.
The Governing Board may grant admission to students expelled from other districts in accordance with law and when consistent with the Board's goal to provide a safe and secure environment for students and staff.

If a student expelled from another district is granted enrollment, in accordance with the procedures specified below, he/she shall either establish legal residence in this district or enroll pursuant to an interdistrict attendance agreement.  (Education Code 48915.1, 48915.2)

Enrollment During the Term of the Expulsion

The district shall not enroll a student expelled by another district for any of the offenses listed in Education Code 48915(a) or (c) (mandatory expulsion offenses) during the term of the student's expulsion, unless the enrollment is at a community day school. (Education Code 48915.2) 

Upon receiving a request for enrollment from a student expelled from another district for acts other than those specified in Education Code 48915(a) or (c), the Board shall hold a hearing to determine whether the student poses a continuing danger to students or staff.  The hearing shall be conducted and notice shall be provided in accordance with procedures governing expulsion of students described in Education Code 48918. (Education Code 48915.1) 

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48915.1, when requesting enrollment, the parent/guardian of a student expelled for an act other than those specified in Education Code 48915(a) or (c) must inform the receiving district of the student's status with the previous district. If the parent/guardian neglects to inform the district of this status, the Board shall discuss and record this lack of compliance at the hearing. Education Code 48915.1 authorizes a district to contact another district regarding the expulsion or recommendation for expulsion of a student applying for admission.
If the student or parent/guardian neglects to inform the district that the student was expelled from his/her previous district for an act other than those listed in Education Code 48915(a) or (c), the Board shall record and discuss this lack of compliance during the hearing.  (Education Code 48915.1)

If the Board finds that a student expelled for acts other than those specified in Education Code 48915(a) or (c) does not pose a continuing danger to students or staff, the student may be admitted or conditionally admitted during the term of expulsion. If the Board determines that the student does pose a continuing danger to students or staff, the student shall not be admitted.  (Education Code 48915.1)

Enrollment After the Term of the Expulsion

A student expelled for an act specified in Education Code 48915(a) or (c) may enroll in the district after the term of his/her expulsion if the Board finds, at a hearing, that the student does not pose a continuing danger to students or staff.  The hearing shall be conducted and notice shall be provided in accordance with procedures governing expulsion of students described in Education Code 48918.  (Education Code 48915.2)

A student expelled for any act other than those specified in Education Code 48915(a) or (c) may request enrollment after the term of his/her expulsion in accordance with the district's procedures for establishing residency or interdistrict transfer.
