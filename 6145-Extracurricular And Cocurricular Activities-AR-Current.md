Definitions

For purposes of applying eligibility criteria for student participation, extracurricular and cocurricular activities shall be defined as follows:  (Education Code 35160.5)

	Extracurricular activities are not part of the regular school curriculum, are not graded, do not offer credit, do not take place during classroom time, and have all of the following characteristics:
	 
	
		The program is supervised or financed by the school district.
		 
		Students participating in the program represent the school district.
		 
		Students exercise some degree of freedom in the selection, planning, or control of the program.
		 
		The program includes both preparation for performance and performance before an audience or spectators.
		 
	
	
	Cocurricular activities are programs that may be associated with the curriculum in a regular classroom.

An activity is not an extracurricular or cocurricular activity if either of the following conditions applies:  (Education Code 35160.5)


	It is a teacher-graded or required program or activity for a course which satisfies the entrance requirements for admission to the California State University or the University of California.
	 
	It is a program that has as its primary goal the improvement of academic or educational achievement of students.

Eligibility Requirements

The grade point average (GPA) used to determine eligibility for extracurricular and cocurricular activities shall be based on grades of the last previous grading period during which the student attended class at least a majority of the time.  If a student was not in attendance for all, or a majority of, the grading period due to absences excused by the school for reasons such as serious illness or injury, approved travel, or work, the GPA used to determine eligibility shall be the grading period immediately prior to the excluded grading period(s). (Education Code 35160.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Districts that do not allow a probationary period as authorized by Education Code 35160.5 (see the accompanying Board policy) should revise the following paragraph accordingly. 
When a student becomes ineligible to participate in extracurricular or cocurricular activities in the upcoming grading period, or when he/she is subject to probation, the principal or designee shall provide written notice to the student and his/her parent/guardian.

Supervision

All extracurricular activities conducted under the name or auspices of a district school or any class or organization of the school, regardless of where the activities are held, shall be under the direct supervision of certificated employees.  (5 CCR 5531)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49024 requires any noncertificated person who works with students in a district-sponsored student activity program, whether in a paid or volunteer position, to obtain an Activity Supervisor Clearance Certificate from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, unless the district requires the person to clear a Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal background check prior to beginning the duties. "Student activity programs" include, but are not limited to, scholastic programs, interscholastic programs, and extracurricular activities sponsored by the district or a school booster club, such as cheer team, drill team, dance team, and marching band. Also see BP/AR 1240 - Volunteer Assistance and BP 4127/4227/4327 - Temporary Athletic Team Coaches. 
Any noncertificated person working with students in a district-sponsored extracurricular student activity program shall possess an Activity Supervisor Clearance Certificate from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing or shall have cleared a Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal background check prior to beginning his/her duties, in accordance with BP 4127/4227/4327 - Temporary Athletic Team Coaches.  (Education Code 49024)
