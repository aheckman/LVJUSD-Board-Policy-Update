## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49011, a district is prohibited from requiring students to pay a fee, deposit, or other charge in order to participate in an educational activity as defined in Education Code 49010. A district is also required to provide the supplies, materials, and equipment needed by students to participate in educational activities. Education Code 49011 clarifies that an otherwise impermissible fee would not be made permissible by the provision of a waiver for some students. However, pursuant to 5 CCR 350, a district is permitted, in certain circumstances, to impose fees that are specifically authorized by law. See the accompanying administrative regulation for a list of permissible fees.
The Governing Board recognizes its responsibility to ensure that books, materials, equipment, supplies, and other resources necessary for student participation in the district's educational program are made available to students at no cost.

CSBA NOTE: According to the California Department of Education's (CDE), "Fiscal Management Advisory 22-01, Summer School, Third Parties, and Tuition Fees," a district is prohibited from charging a fee for an educational activity that is offered by the district that constitutes an integral fundamental part of education, such as summer school, if offered by the district.
No student shall be required to pay a fee, deposit, or other charge for participation in an educational activity which constitutes an integral fundamental part of the district's educational program, including curricular and extracurricular activities.  (Education Code 49010, 49011; 5 CCR 350)

As necessary, the Board may approve fees, deposits, and other charges which are specifically authorized by law. When approving such fees, deposits, or charges, establishing fee schedules, or determining whether waivers or exceptions should be granted, the Board shall consider relevant data, including the socioeconomic conditions of students' families and their ability to pay.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. The prohibition against student fees pursuant to Education Code 49011 does not restrict districts from soliciting for voluntary donations, participating in fundraising activities, or providing prizes or other recognition for participants in such fundraising activities. However, according to CDE's, "Fiscal Management Advisory 20-01, Pupil Fees, Deposits, and Other Charges," the prohibition against student fees bars a district from requiring volunteer hours as a condition of admission, enrollment, continued enrollment, sibling preference, attendance, participation in educational activities, or receipt of credit or privileges related to educational activities.
The prohibition against student fees shall not prevent the district from soliciting for donations, conducting fundraising activities, or providing prizes or other recognition for participants in such activities and events. The Superintendent or designee shall emphasize that participation of students, parents/guardians, district employees, volunteers, or educational or civic organizations in such activities and events is voluntary. The district shall not offer or award to a student any course credit or privileges related to educational activities in exchange for voluntary donations or participation in fundraising activities by or on behalf of the student. The district also shall not remove or threaten to remove from a student any course credit or privileges related to educational activities, or otherwise discriminate against the student, due to a lack of voluntary donations or participation in fundraising activities by or on behalf of the student.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee may provide information or professional development opportunities to administrators, teachers, and other personnel regarding permissible fees.

Complaints

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49013, a district is mandated to adopt policy and procedures which allow complaints to be filed using the uniform complaint procedures when the district is alleged to have violated the prohibition against requiring unauthorized student fees. See BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures for language implementing this mandate.
A complaint alleging district noncompliance with the prohibition against requiring student fees, deposits, or other charges shall be filed in accordance with the district's procedures in BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.  (Education Code 49013)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49013 requires districts found in violation of the prohibition against student fees to design a remedy which may include reasonable efforts to identify and fully reimburse all affected individuals as specified in 5 CCR 4600. See AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures for additional language reflecting these requirements.
If, upon investigation, the district finds merit in the complaint, the Superintendent or designee shall recommend and the Board shall adopt an appropriate remedy to be provided to all affected students and parents/guardians in accordance with 5 CCR 4600.

Information related to the prohibition against requiring students to pay fees for participation in an educational activity shall be included in the district's annual notification of uniform complaint procedures to be provided to all students, parents/guardians, employees, and other interested parties pursuant to 5 CCR 4622.  (Education Code 49013)

Collection of Debt

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49014 establishes requirements for districts to follow when seeking to recover a debt owed by students and/or parents/guardians, including debts resulting from unpaid fees lawfully imposed by a district. See the accompanying administrative regulation for additional language reflecting these requirements.The debt collection requirements do not apply to debt owed as a result of vandalism or loss of district property loaned to the student. For further information in regard to such debt, see AR 3515.4 - Recovery for Property Loss or Damage.
The Superintendent or designee shall, in accordance with law, recover any debt owed to the district as a result of unpaid permissible student fees approved by the Board. However, the district shall not bill a current or former student for accumulated debt, nor take negative action against a student or former student because of such debt, including, but not limited to, any of the following:  (Education Code 49014)

	Denying full credit for any class assignment
	 
	Denying full and equal participation in any classroom activity
	 
	Denying access to the library or other on-campus educational facilities
	 
	Denying or withholding grades or transcripts
	 
	Denying or withholding a diploma
	 
	Limiting or barring participation in an extracurricular activity, club, or sport
	 
	Limiting or excluding the student from participation in an educational activity, field trip, or school ceremony
