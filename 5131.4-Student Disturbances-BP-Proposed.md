## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide orderly campuses that create a positive school environment and are conducive to learning. When students initiate or are involved in a campus disturbance that has the potential to threaten the safety of students or staff, the Superintendent or designee may request law enforcement assistance.

The Superintendent or designee and the principal of each school shall establish a school disturbance response plan that is intended to curb disruptions which may lead to riots, violence, or vandalism at school or at school-sponsored events. In developing each school's plan, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with local law enforcement authorities to create guidelines for law enforcement support and intervention.

Staff are encouraged to be alert to conditions at school that may lead to a disturbance, such as racial or cultural conflict, student protests, or gang intimidation and confrontations. Staff who believe that a disturbance is imminent, or who see a disturbance occurring, shall immediately contact the principal and invoke the school disturbance response plan.

Students who participate in a campus disturbance shall be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulations.
