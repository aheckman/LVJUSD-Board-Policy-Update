## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. For information about required state assessments administered as part of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), see BP/AR 6162.51 - State Academic Achievement Tests.
The Governing Board recognizes that student assessments are an important instructional and accountability tool. To obtain the most accurate evaluation of student performance, the district shall use a variety of measures, including district, state, and/or national assessments.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph reflects that prohibited and permitted student use of technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), in relation to assessments, should be as specified in BP 5131.9 - Academic Honesty and BP 6163.4 - Student Use of Technology, and may be modified to reflect district practice. The U.S. Department of Education Office of Educational Technology's, "Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Teaching and Learning: Insights and Recommendations," provides information related to the opportunities for using AI to improve education, the challenges in doing so, and recommendations to guide further policy development.
Any student use of technology to complete assessments shall be as specified in Board Policy 5131.9 - Academic Honesty and Board Policy 6163.4 - Student Use of Technology.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph addresses potential uses of student assessment data. Pursuant to Education Code 52060, applicable statewide student assessments must be used as one of the measures of progress toward the district's annual goals for student achievement included in its local control and accountability plan; see AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan. In addition, pursuant to Education Code 44662, evaluations of certificated staff must include an assessment of students' progress toward meeting district standards of expected student achievement at each grade level in each area of study and, if applicable, toward state standards as measured by state criterion-referenced assessments (i.e., assessments that test students' mastery of the content). However, Education Code 44662 prohibits the use of publishers' norms established by standardized tests (i.e., assessments that compare students' performance to a representative sample of students) for the purpose of evaluating and assessing certificated staff performance. The use of student assessment results in staff evaluations may also be addressed in collective bargaining agreements or employment contracts. See BP/AR 4115 - Evaluation/Supervision and BP 4315 - Evaluation/Supervision.
Assessment data shall be used to help determine individual students' progress, mastery of academic standards, appropriate placement in district programs, and/or eligibility for graduation. In addition, summary data on student assessment results shall be used by the district to identify and review student achievement goals in the district's local control and accountability plan, evaluate district educational programs in order to identify needed improvements, and, as appropriate, evaluate staff performance.

In selecting or developing any district assessment, the Superintendent or designee shall examine evidence of its reliability, its validity for the intended purpose and for various student populations, and the extent to which it aligns with the material that is being taught.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that assessments are administered in accordance with law and test publisher's directions, and that test administration procedures are fair and equitable for all students.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52052 requires that schools and districts demonstrate comparable improvement in academic achievement by all "numerically significant" student subgroups, including, as amended by AB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, long term English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and students experiencing homelessness. A "numerically significant" subgroup is one that consists of at least 30 students, or 15 foster youth, students experiencing homelessness, or long-term English learners, each of whom has a valid test score. To evaluate the extent to which the district fulfills this responsibility, it will be important to examine disaggregated student assessment results as provided below.Pursuant to Education Code 49558, the Governing Board may adopt policy allowing the use of individual applications or records from the free and reduced-price meal program to identify students for the purpose of disaggregating student achievement data. See BP/AR 3553 - Free and Reduced Price Meals for optional language providing such authorization.
As appropriate, assessment results shall be disaggregated by student subgroup, classroom, grade level, and/or school site to allow for critical analysis of student needs.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide professional development as needed to assist administrators and teachers in interpreting and using assessment data to improve student performance and the instructional program.

When districtwide and school-level results of student assessments are published by the state, the Superintendent or designee may provide supplementary information to assist parents/guardians and the community in understanding test results.

Interim and Formative Assessments

CSBA NOTE: At their discretion, districts may choose to use the Smarter Balanced interim and formative assessments, which are part of the CAASPP. Pursuant to Education Code 60642.6, these tests may be used, in combination with other sources of information, to gain timely feedback about student progress in an effort to continually adjust instruction to improve learning. Education Code 60642.7 specifies that results of such assessments shall not be used for any high-stakes purpose.
State interim and formative assessments may be used in combination with other sources of information to gain timely feedback about student progress in an effort to continually adjust instruction to improve learning, and for communicating with students' parents/guardians and  identifying professional development goals. Results from interim and formative assessments shall not be used for any high-stakes purpose, including, but not limited to, teacher or other school staff evaluation, accountability, student grade promotion or retention, graduation, course or class placement, identification for gifted or talented education, reclassification of English learners, or identification as an individual with exceptional needs.  (Education Code 60642.6, 60642.7)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that teachers who administer interim and formative assessments have access to all functions and information designed for teacher use related to such assessments and student performance on the assessments.  (Education Code 60642.6)

Individual Record of Accomplishment

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that maintain high schools.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each student, by the end of grade 12, has an individual record of accomplishment that includes the following:  (Education Code 60607)

	The results of the state achievement tests required and administered as part of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, or any predecessor assessments, pursuant to Education Code 60640-60649
	 
	The results of any end-of-course examinations taken
	 
	The results of any vocational education certification examinations taken

No individual record of accomplishment shall be released to any person, other than the student's parent/guardian or a teacher, counselor, or administrator directly involved with the student, without the written consent of the student's parent/guardian, or the student if the student is an adult or emancipated minor. The student or the student's parent/guardian may authorize the release of the record of accomplishment to a postsecondary educational institution for the purposes of credit, placement, or admission. Furthermore, the results of an individual student on the CAASPP may be released to a postsecondary educational institution for the purpose of credit, placement, or admission.  (Education Code 60607)
