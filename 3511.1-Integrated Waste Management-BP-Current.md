## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy may be revised to reflect district practice.  Pursuant to Public Resources Code 42630, districts and schools are encouraged to assist cities and counties in meeting the solid waste diversion goals set by Public Resources Code 41780.  Pursuant to Public Resources Code 42649.2 and 42649.81, businesses, including schools, are required to arrange for recycling services if the amount of solid or organic waste they produce meets the thresholds specified in law and the accompanying administrative regulation. The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) offers resources identifying waste management strategies, available funding sources, and education and school waste reduction programs that provide curriculum to link instruction on integrated waste management and environmental concepts with student action projects at school sites.
The Governing Board believes that the conservation of water, energy, and other natural resources, the protection of the environment, and the implementation of an effective waste diversion program are connected to the district's educational mission and are essential to the health and well-being of the community.  The Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement a cost-effective, integrated waste management program that incorporates the principles of green school operations.

The district's integrated waste management program shall include strategies designed to promote waste management practices of source reduction, recycling, and composting to help the district reduce and recycle solid and organic waste, properly dispose of potentially hazardous materials, improve efficiency in the use of natural resources, and minimize the impact of such use on the environment.  The program shall address all areas of the district's operations, including, but not limited to, procurement, resource utilization, and facilities management practices.

The Superintendent or designee may collaborate with city, county, and state agencies and other public or private agencies in developing and implementing the district's integrated waste management program.

CSBA NOTE: CalRecycle provides grants and related information to eligible schools for developing and implementing integrated waste management programs.  For more information, see CalRecycle's web site.
The Superintendent or designee shall make every effort to identify funding opportunities for the district's integrated waste management program, including applying for available grants or other cost-reduction incentives.

The Superintendent or designee may provide appropriate educational and training opportunities to students and staff regarding the benefits and methods of conserving natural resources and the manner in which integrated waste management strategies impact such efforts.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly monitor all aspects of the district's integrated waste management program and shall provide an update to the Board on its effectiveness as necessary.
