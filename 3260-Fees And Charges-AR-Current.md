Districts with questions as to whether a particular fee may be charged should consult CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
When approved by the Governing Board, the Superintendent or designee may impose a fee for the following:  (5 CCR 350)

	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 17551 permits the district to sell to a student any property of the district which has been fabricated by the student, as provided in Item #6 below.

	Reimbursement to the district for the direct cost of materials used by students to fabricate property they will take home for their own possession and use, such as wood shop, art, or sewing projects kept by students  (Education Code 17551)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 39807.5, as amended by AB 181 (Ch. 52, Statutes of 2022), prohibits charging a fee for transportation to the parent/guardian of an unduplicated student as defined in Education Code 42238.02, which includes a student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals, who is an English learner, or who is a foster youth.
	Home-to-school transportation and transportation between regular, full-time day schools and regional occupational centers, programs, or classes, as long as the fee does not exceed the statewide average nonsubsidized cost per student, and an exemption is made for any student with a disability, or any student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals, any student who is an English learner, or any student who is a foster youth.  (Education Code 39807.5)

	An adult education or secondary school community service class in civic, vocational, literacy, health, family and consumer sciences, technical, and general education, not to exceed the cost of maintaining the class  (Education Code 51810-51815)
	
	CSBA NOTE: In its, "Fiscal Management Advisory 20-01," CDE interprets Education Code 32030-32033 as permitting the district to charge fees for safety glasses that a student keeps, if the school provides them free of charge for use in specified courses or activities involving the use of hazardous substances likely to cause injury to the eyes.
	Eye safety devices worn in courses or activities involving the use of hazardous substances likely to cause injury to the eyes, when being sold to students and/or teachers or instructors to keep and at a price not to exceed the district's actual costs  (Education Code 32033)
	 
	Actual cost of furnishing copies of any student's records, except that no charge shall be made for furnishing up to two transcripts or two verifications of a former student's records or for reproducing records of a student with a disability when the cost would effectively prevent the parent/guardian from exercising the right to receive the copies  (Education Code 49065, 56504)

	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to the California Universal Meals Program established by Education Code 49501.5, as added by AB 130 (Ch. 44, Statutes of 2021), a district is required to provide a free, nutritionally adequate breakfast and lunch each school day, to any student who requests a meal, without consideration of the student's eligibility for a federally funded free or reduced-price meal. For more information regarding the California Universal Meals Program see BP/AR 3550 - Food Service/Child Nutrition Program, BP/AR 3551 - Food Service Operations/Cafeteria Fund, and BP/AR 3553 - Free and Reduced Price Meals.
	Food sold at school, subject to the California Universal Meals Program, free and reduced-price meal program eligibility, and other restrictions specified in law  (Education Code 38084, 49501.5)
	
	CSBA NOTE: According to CDE's, "Fiscal Management Advisory 20-01," a blanket policy that charges fees for any damage caused to district property would be inconsistent with Education Code 19911 and 48904. Therefore, a district should analyze, on a case-by-case basis, whether property has been willfully damaged.
	In accordance with law, replacement cost or reimbursement for lost or willfully damaged district books, supplies, or property, or for district property loaned to a student that the student fails to return  (Education Code 19910-19911, 48904)

	Adult education books, materials, transportation, and classes, except that no fee may be charged for classes in elementary subjects, classes for which high school credit is granted when taken by a person who does not hold a high school diploma, or classes in English and citizenship  (Education Code 39801.5, 52612, 60410)
	 
	Preschool and child care and development services, in accordance with the fee schedule established by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, unless the family qualifies for subsidized services or the program is exempted from fees by law  (Education Code 8211, 8213, 8252-8254)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Districts are prohibited from charging a fee for summer school programs. However, it is permissible for third parties that offer a summer school program to charge a fee for such program. CDE's, "Fiscal Management Advisory 22-01, Summer School, Third Parties, and Tuition Fees," provides that if a third party that is affiliated with a district charges tuition for a summer program, the district should make an individualized inquiry as to the relationship between the district and the third party to determine whether the educational activities are being offered by the district. In making this determination, districts may consider factors listed in Fiscal Management Advisory 22-01. Districts with questions as to whether a fee may be charged for summer school should consult CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
	Participation in a before-school, after-school, or intersession program that is funded as an After School Education and Safety (ASES) program, 21st Century Community Learning Center (21st CCLC), 21st Century High School After School Safety and Enrichment for Teens (ASSETs) program, or Expanded Learning Opportunity (ELO) program, provided that fees are waived or reduced for families with students who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals and, in regard to ASES and 21st CCLC programs, fees are not charged if the district knows the student is a homeless or foster youth  (Education Code 8422, 8482.6, 46120)
	
	CSBA NOTE: In, "Fiscal Management Advisory 20-01," CDE lists Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate examination fees as permissible. Some districts choose to reduce the cost of the fees for low-income students through the use of district funds or other funding sources; see BP 6141.4 - International Baccalaureate Program and BP 6141.5 - Advanced Placement.
	Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Diploma examinations for college credits, as long as the examination is not a course requirement and the results have no impact on student grades or credits in the course

CSBA NOTE: In its, "Fiscal Management Advisory 20-01," CDE advises that a district that requires its students to wear a cap and gown as a condition for their participation in the high school graduation ceremony may not require such students to purchase the cap and gown. CDE recommends that such districts provide the graduates with a cap and gown for their use at the graduation ceremony and inform them that those interested may purchase a cap and gown from a vendor.
Collection of Debt

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49014 (the Public School Fair Debt Collection Act) establishes requirements for districts to follow when seeking to recover a debt owed by students and/or parents/guardians, including a requirement to provide the parent/guardian with an itemized invoice that references the district's policies relating to debt collection and the rights established pursuant to Education Code 49014 and 49557.5 (unpaid meal fees). It is recommended that districts include references to this administrative regulation and the accompanying Board policy. For additional rights established by Education Code 49014, including prohibitions against directly billing a student or former student or imposing any negative action on a student, see the accompanying Board policy.
Before pursuing payment of any debt that has accumulated from unpaid permissible fees, the Superintendent or designee shall provide an itemized invoice for any amount owed by the parent/guardian on behalf of a student or former student. The invoice shall reference district policies related to debt collection and the rights established pursuant to Education Code 49014 and 49557.5. For each payment received, the district shall provide a receipt to the parent/guardian.  (Education Code 49014)

The Superintendent or designee shall not sell debt owed by a parent/guardian of a student or former student.  (Education Code 49014)
