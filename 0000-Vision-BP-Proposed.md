## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that a clearly stated purpose and direction for the District provide the foundation for continuous improvement and accountability. The Board shall adopt a long-range vision for District programs and activities that focuses on the achievement and well-being of all students and reflects the importance of preparing students for the future academically, professionally, and personally. The vision shall recognize the unique role of students, parents/guardians, staff, and community partners in contributing to a high-quality education for all students. The District's vision may be incorporated into its mission or purpose statement, philosophy or motto, long-term goals, short-term objectives, and comprehensive plans such as the local control and accountability plan (LCAP).

The Superintendent or designee shall recommend an appropriate process, with clearly defined procedures, timelines, and responsibilities, for establishing, reviewing, and updating the District's vision statements. This process shall include a review of relevant District documents and data including, but not limited to, information about student demographics, student achievement, current programs, and emerging educational issues. The process shall incorporate an analysis and identification of District strengths and areas in which growth is needed. Input shall be solicited from parents/guardians, students, staff, and community members through methods such as surveys, focus groups, advisory committees, and/or public meetings and forums.

The Board shall review the District's vision statements annually, in conjunction with the update to the LCAP, to ensure consistency among all documents that set direction for the District. Following these reviews, the Board may revise or reaffirm the direction it has established for the District.

The Superintendent or designee shall communicate the District's vision to staff, parents/guardians, and the community.

Board decisions regarding curriculum, policies, the budget, collective bargaining agreements, and other District operations shall be aligned with the District's vision. In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that staff's implementation of District programs and activities supports attainment of the District's vision.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board regarding District progress toward the vision.
