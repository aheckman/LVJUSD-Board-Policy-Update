## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the importance of maintaining ongoing positive relations with employees and engaging in fair, respectful negotiations with employee organizations. The Board desires to reach agreement on employment contracts in a manner that prevents disruption to school operations and minimizes impact on student achievement.

The Board recognizes that advance planning is necessary to ensure that, in the event of a work stoppage, strike, or other concerted employee activity, students continue to receive educational services to which they are entitled. The Superintendent or designee shall develop a written plan which shall include strategies for the provision of internal and external communications, preservation of student and staff safety, maintenance of District operations, and appropriate student instruction and supervision during a work slowdown or stoppage.

Days of instruction lost due to a work stoppage may be made up following the end of the normal school year.

If an employee organization gives notice that it intends to strike, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the Public Employment Relations Board, Employment Development Department, employees in the striking unit, other District employees, parents/guardians, students, law enforcement, the media, and others as appropriate.

Employees should be held accountable for their behavior during any labor dispute. The District may take disciplinary action against any employee who engages in an unlawful concerted action or in unlawful behavior in an otherwise protected activity, taking into account the seriousness of the behavior and the District's efforts to rebuild relations following the withholding of services by employees. 

However, the District shall not discontinue or threaten to discontinue employer contributions for health care or other medical coverage for any employee or their enrolled dependents for the duration of the employee’s participation in an authorized strike, as defined in Government Code 3141 and specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.
