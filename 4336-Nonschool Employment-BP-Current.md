## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: In order to help prevent financial conflicts of interest, Government Code 1126 prohibits a district employee or Governing Board member from engaging in any activity which is inconsistent, incompatible, in conflict with, or inimical to his/her duties.  Government Code 1126 mandates the district to adopt procedures regarding this prohibition.  See BB 9270 - Conflict of Interest for language regarding incompatible activities of Board members and other designated employees.  Also see BP 4135/4235/4335 - Soliciting and Selling. The following policy should be modified to reflect district practice.
In order to help maintain public trust in the integrity of district operations, the Governing Board expects all employees to give the responsibility of their positions precedence over any other outside employment.  A district employee may receive compensation for outside activities as long as these activities are not inconsistent, incompatible, in conflict with, or inimical to his/her district duties.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 1126, the district may determine which particular outside activities would be incompatible with an employee's duties.   The following list may be modified to reflect any specific positions or activities which the district has determined to be incompatible.
An outside activity shall be considered inconsistent, incompatible, or inimical to district employment when such activity:  (Government Code 1126)

	Requires time periods that interfere with the proper, efficient discharge of the employee's duties
	 
	Entails compensation from an outside source for activities which are part of the employee's regular duties
	 
	Involves using the district's name, prestige, time, facilities, equipment, or supplies for private gain
	 
	Involves service which will be wholly or in part subject to the approval or control of another district employee or Board member

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 1126 mandates that the district's procedure include a provision for giving notice to employees of the determination of whether an activity is prohibited and of disciplinary action to be taken, as well as a process for employees to appeal either the determination or the imposition of disciplinary action.  The following two paragraphs should be modified to reflect district practice.
An employee wishing to accept outside employment that may be inconsistent, incompatible, in conflict with, or inimical to the employee's duties shall file a written request with his/her immediate supervisor describing the nature of the employment and the time required.  The supervisor shall evaluate each request based on the employee's specific duties within the district and determine whether to grant authorization for such employment.

The supervisor shall inform the employee whether the outside employment is prohibited.  The employee may appeal a supervisor's denial of authorization to the Superintendent or designee. An employee who continues to pursue a prohibited activity may be subject to disciplinary action.

Tutoring

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 80334 prohibits a certificated employee from accepting any compensation or benefit, other than his/her regular compensation, for the performance of any service which he/she must perform within the scope of his/her district employment. However, 5 CCR 80334 does not apply to overtime or the performance of supplemental services at the district's request, nor does it restrict the acceptance of gifts or tokens of minimal value offered and accepted openly from students, parents/guardians, or other persons in recognition or appreciation of service.The following section may be modified to reflect district practice.
A certificated employee shall not accept any compensation or other benefit for tutoring a student enrolled in his/her class(es).  An employee who wishes to tutor another district student shall first request authorization from his/her supervisor in accordance with this Board policy.  If authorization is granted, the employee shall not use district facilities, equipment, or supplies when providing the tutoring service.
