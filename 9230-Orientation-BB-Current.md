## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional bylaw may be revised to reflect district practice. In addition to providing new Governing Board members with information about district programs and operations, it is recommended that new Board members be provided information and professional development regarding the roles and responsibilities of the Board (see BB 9000 - Role of the Board) and professional governance standards agreed upon by the Board (see BB 9005 - Governance Standards). The provision of information to Board candidates regarding the district and/or Board responsibilities is addressed in BB 9220 - Governing Board Elections.
The Governing Board recognizes the importance of providing all newly elected or appointed Board members with support and information to assist them in becoming effective members of the Board. Incoming Board members shall be provided an orientation designed to build their knowledge of the district and an understanding of the responsibilities of their position. Such orientation may include the provision of information, support, and/or training related to Board functions, policies, protocols, and standards of conduct.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54952.2, if a majority of Board members congregate at the same time and location to hear or discuss matters within the jurisdiction of the Board, the meeting must be open to the public and proper notice provided; see BB 9320 - Meetings and Notices. The following optional paragraph provides for orientation meetings to be held with all members of the Board during a public Board meeting and may be revised to reflect district practice.
As early as possible following the election or appointment of Board members, one or more orientation sessions shall be held during open meeting(s) of the Board. The Board president and the Superintendent or designee shall develop an agenda for the meeting(s) and shall identify resources that may be useful for incoming Board members.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.  Pursuant to Government Code 54952.7, the Board may require that a copy of the Brown Act be given to each member of the Board and any person elected to the Board who has not yet assumed the duties of office.  Government Code 54952.1 states that persons elected to serve as Board members, even if they have not yet assumed office, are subject to the requirements of the Brown Act as soon as they are elected.
Upon their election or appointment, incoming Board members shall be provided a copy of the Brown Act and informed that, pursuant to Government Code 54952.1, they must conform to the Act's requirements as if they had already assumed office. Additional information for incoming Board members may include, but is not limited to, Board bylaws related to the limits of individual Board member authority, the conduct of Board meetings, and other Board operations; governance standards for ethical conduct; legal requirements related to conflict of interest and prohibited political activity; protocols for speaking with district staff, members of the public, and the media; and publications on effective governance practices.

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall provide incoming Board members with specific background information regarding the district, including, but not limited to, the district's vision and goals statements, local control and accountability plan and other comprehensive plans, student demographic data, student achievement data, district policy manual, district budget, and minutes of recent open Board meetings.

The Superintendent or designee may offer incoming Board members a tour of district schools and facilities, and may introduce them to district and school site administrators and other staff.

CSBA NOTE: See CSBA's web site for information about CSBA conferences and workshops that address the needs of new Board members, including its Orientation for New Trustees, Institute for New and First-Term Board Members, and other education opportunities related to governance basics.Pursuant to Government Code 54952.2, a "meeting" subject to Brown Act requirements does not include the attendance of a majority of the Board's members at a conference or similar public gathering, provided that a majority of the members do not discuss among themselves business of a specific nature that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board. See BB 9240 - Board Training and BB 9320 - Meetings and Notices.
Incoming members are encouraged, at district expense and with approval of the Board, to attend the California School Boards Association's Orientation for New Trustees, Institute for New and First-Term Board Members, and workshops and conferences relevant to the needs of the individual member, the Board as a whole, or the district.
