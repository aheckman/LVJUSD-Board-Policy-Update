## Policy Content

Accounts

The district's accounting system shall fully comply with the definitions, instructions and procedures set forth in the California Department of Education (CDE) School Accounting Manual.  (Education Code 41010)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to the Governmental Accounting Standards Board's (GASB) Statement #87, and GASB's Implementation Guide No. 2019-3, there is only one single model for lease accounting with no distinction between capital and operating leases."Subscription-based information technology arrangements" (SBITA) is defined as a contract that conveys control of the right to use another party's (a SBITA vendor's) information technology (IT) software, alone or in combination with tangible capital assets (the underlying IT assets), as specified in the contract for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction. Such arrangements are covered under GASB Statement #96, "Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements," which states that when a district utilizes SBITA, it results in an intangible right-to-use subscription asset and a corresponding subscription liability and requires disclosure. Because of the liability and disclosure requirements, the district should ensure proper accounting of assets based on type, and consult with the district's auditor as necessary.Additional information about GASB Statements #87 and #96 can be found in GASB's accompanying Implementation Guides, available on GASB's website, and the California Department of Education's (CDE), "Standardized Account Code Structure (SACS) November 2, 2021 meeting minutes," available on CDE's website. For more information on financial reports of the district, see BP/AR 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability.
The district shall utilize CDE's standardized account code structure (SACS) software to develop financial reports. The district's accounting system shall comply with generally accepted accounting principles prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and meet other state and federal reporting guidelines.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that funds are encumbered in the district accounting records immediately after an expenditure is committed for subsequent payment.

District Investigation

The Superintendent or designee shall investigate reports of fraudulent activity in a manner that protects the confidentiality of the parties and the facts. All employees involved in the investigation shall be advised to keep information about the investigation confidential.

If an investigation substantiates the occurrence of a fraudulent activity, the Superintendent or designee shall issue a report to appropriate personnel and to the Governing Board. The final disposition of the matter, any decision to file a criminal complaint or refer the matter to the appropriate law enforcement and/or regulatory agency for independent investigation, and discussing or disclosing the result of any investigation shall be made in consultation with legal counsel.

County Office of Education Investigation

CSBA NOTE: The Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT) is an independent entity whose primary mission is to help districts identify, prevent, and resolve financial, operational, and data management challenges, including assisting districts to avert fiscal insolvency, providing districts with fiscal management assistance, and creating efficient organizational operations. FCMAT assists with extraordinary audits conducted pursuant to Education Code 1241.5, which permits the County Superintendent of Schools to review or audit a district's expenditures and internal controls if the County Superintendent has reason to believe that fraud, misappropriation of funds, or other illegal fiscal practices have occurred that merit examination. It is the responsibility of the County Superintendent to report the findings and recommendations to the Governing Board at a regularly scheduled board meeting within 45 days of completing the review, audit, or examination, and then, no later than 15 calendar days after receipt of the report, the district is required to notify the County Superintendent of its proposed actions on the recommendations.
The district shall cooperate with the County Superintendent of Schools, Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT), law enforcement, or other governmental entities that conduct a fraud investigation, in accordance with law.  (Education Code 1241.5)
