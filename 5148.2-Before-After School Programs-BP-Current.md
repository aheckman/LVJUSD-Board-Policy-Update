## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is for use by districts providing expanded learning opportunities beyond the regular school day, including before-school, after-school, summer, vacation, and/or intersessional programs, and should be revised to reflect the program(s) offered by the district. For eligible programs in grades Transitional Kindergarten (TK)-9, the district may apply for funding from the state's After School Education and Safety Program (ASES) (Education Code 8482-8484.65) and/or the federal 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program (21st CCLC) (Education Code 8484.7-8484.9; 20 USC 7171-7176). The federal 21st Century High School After School Safety and Enrichment for Teens Program (ASSETs) (Education Code 8420-8428; 20 USC 7171-7176) provides funding for eligible programs in grades 9-12. These programs are optional and have different requirements. See the accompanying administrative regulation for major requirements of each program, including mandated policy language regarding late arrival and early dismissal for students participating in ASES.Education Code 46120 provides for the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO) and allocates funding to districts under a formula based on a district's average daily attendance and percentage of unduplicated students, defined as any student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals, who is an English learner, or who is a foster youth. Districts with a prior fiscal year local control funding formula unduplicated pupil percentage of less than 75 percent are required to offer access to ELO to all unduplicated students in classroom-based instructional programs in grades TK-6, inclusive, and ensure that access is provided to any unduplicated student whose parent/guardian requests placement in ELO. Pursuant to Education Code 46120, on school days, ELO must include in-person before or after school programs and, on non-school days, intersessional programs of specified lengths of time as described below and in the accompanying administrative regulation. Student participation in ELO is optional; however, districts may not opt out of providing ELO.Pursuant to Education Code 46120, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), a district may contract with a third-party to provide ELOs, and that third-party is required to comply with applicable child care facility license requirements including when serving children who do not participate in ASES, 21st CCLC, or ELO. Pursuant to Education Code 46120, as amended by AB 176 (Ch. 998, Statutes of 2024), an ELO operated by a third-party that holds a child daycare facility license or special permit, as of June 1, 2023, is required to maintain that license or permit capacity as a requirement of contracting for ELOs until June 30, 2025.The California Department of Education (CDE) monitors, through its Federal Program Monitoring (FPM) process, Expanded Learning Division grants including before-school, after-school, summer/supplemental, equitable access, ASES transportation, and ELO.The following policy is applicable to ASES, 21st CCLC, ASSETS and ELO, unless otherwise noted, and may be adapted by districts that offer other programs through district funding or alternative sources. If the district does not offer any programs beyond the regular school day, it may modify the following policy as appropriate.
The Governing Board desires to provide learning opportunities for students beyond the regular school day that support the regular education program in a supervised environment. The content of such programs shall be coordinated with the district's vision and goals for student learning, local control and accountability plan, curriculum, and academic standards.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph reflects requirements related to collaborative planning for the programs offered by the district. ASES (Education Code 8482.5), ASSETs (Education Code 8422), 21st CCLC (Education Code 8484.75), and ELO (Education Code 46120) have different collaboration requirements; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
Each program offered by the district shall be planned through a collaborative process as required by law.  (Education Code 8422, 8482.5, 8484.75, 46120)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 8482.5, in awarding funding for ASES programs, the state gives priority to schools with at least 50 percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Pursuant to 20 USC 7174, funding for the 21st CCLC and ASSETs programs is restricted to schools receiving federal Title I funding. Additionally, 20 USC 7174 and Education Code 8422 and 8484.8 give competitive priority for these federal programs to applications jointly submitted by school districts and community organizations for programs that (1) are located in schools that are implementing comprehensive or targeted support and improvement activities pursuant to 20 USC 6311 or other schools determined by the district to be in need of intervention and support to improve student academic achievement and other outcomes, (2) serve students at risk for academic failure, dropping out of school, involvement in criminal or delinquent activities, or lacking strong positive role models, (3) provide activities not otherwise accessible to participating students or expand accessibility to high-quality services that may be available in the community, (4) continue or expand existing grants, and (5) for 21st CCLC programs, provide year-round expanded learning programming. For a further description of competitive priority for funding, see CDE's, "After School Education and Safety, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, 21st Century High School After School Safety Enrichment for Teens Grant Programs Frequently Asked Questions," and, "Expanded Learning Funding Opportunities," available on its website.
The district shall prioritize offering Expanded Learning Opportunities Programs (ELO) at school sites in the lowest income communities, as determined by prior year percentages of students eligible for free and reduced-price meals, while maximizing the number of schools and neighborhoods with ELOs across their attendance area.  (Education Code 46120)

To the extent feasible, the district shall give priority to establishing expanded learning opportunities beyond the regular school day in low-performing schools and/or programs that serve low-income and other at-risk students.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46120, as amended by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), districts are required, beginning with the 2025-26 fiscal year, to annually declare to CDE their operational intent to run an ELO in accordance with instructions and forms that will be furnished by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
Any expanded learning opportunities, including but not limited to After School Education and Safety  (ASES), 21st Century Community Learning Center (21st CCLC), 21st Century High School After School Safety and Enrichment for Teens (ASSETs), ELO, or any other program to be established pursuant to Education Code 8421, 8482.3, 8484.75, or 46120, shall be approved by the Board. Additionally, the Board shall declare its operational intent to run an ELO to the Superintendent of Public Instruction as specified in Education Code 46120.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is applicable to all programs. Pursuant to Education Code 8483.4 (applicable to ASES, 21st CCLC, and ELO), the program administrator is required to establish qualifications for each staff position that, at a minimum, ensure that all staff members who directly supervise students meet the minimum qualifications for an instructional aide pursuant to district policies; see the accompanying administrative regulation. A district offering an ASSETs program must establish its expectations for staff qualifications.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all staff who directly supervise students in any expanded learning opportunities possess appropriate knowledge and experience. As needed, staff and volunteers shall receive ongoing training related to their job responsibilities.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46120, as amended by SB 153, ELO funds may also be used to support attendance recovery programs when attendance recovery is operated by the district in conjunction with, and on the same school site as, its ELO. For more information on attendance recovery programs, see BP/AR 5113.1 - Chronic Absence and Truancy and BP 5147 - Dropout Prevention.
Each before-school, after-school, summer, vacation or intersessional expanded learning opportunity shall include academic and enrichment elements in accordance with law and administrative regulation, and may be used in conjunction with attendance recovery programs. Additionally, each program may include support services that reinforce the educational component and promote student health and well-being.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 8482.6 (applicable to ASES, 21st CCLC, and ELO) and Education Code 8422 (applicable to ASSETs programs) authorize the district to charge fees to participating families, with certain exceptions as described below.Option 1 below is for use by districts that choose not to charge family fees. Option 2 is for use by districts that will charge a permissible family fee to cover unfunded costs of the program.
OPTION 1:  (For districts that do not charge family fees)

No fee shall be charged for participation in the program.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (For districts that charge permissible family fees)

A family fee may be charged to participating families based on the actual cost of services.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts selecting Option 2 that offer an ASSETS program, and may be modified to reflect any program(s) offered by the district. Pursuant to Education Code 8422, ASSETs programs that charge fees to participating families are required to waive or reduce the fees for families with students who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals.
However, for the ASSETs program, a family fee shall be waived or reduced for families with students who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals.  (Education Code 8422)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts selecting Option 2 that offer ASES, 21st CCLC, and/or ELO, and may be modified to reflect any program(s) offered by the district. Pursuant to Education Code 8482.6, family fees may not be charged for these programs for a student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals or if the district knows the participating student is experiencing homelessness or in foster care. Additionally, a program that charges such fees is required to schedule fees on a sliding scale that considers family income and ability to pay. CDE, through its FPM process, will review whether the district has policy(ies) in place to waive or reduce the income collected for youth eligible for free and reduced-price meals and that the program is not charging youth who are identified as experiencing homelessness or foster youth.
For ASES, 21st CCLC, and/or ELO, no fee shall be charged for a student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals, or a student experiencing homelessness, or in foster care. Family fees shall be calculated on a sliding scale that considers family income and ability to pay.  (Education Code 8482.6, 46120)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this policy is for use by districts that selected either Option 1 or 2 above.The following optional paragraph is for use by districts with programs serving students ages 11-12 years. Welfare and Institutions Code 10273, provides that the preferred placement for students ages 11-12 years is in a before-school or after-school program rather than in subsidized child care and development services. When subsidized child care services are also available, students ages 11-12 years will be eligible for subsidized child care services only for the portion of care that is not available in a before-school or after-school program. See AR 5148 - Child Care and Development.
Eligible students who are 11 or 12 years of age shall be placed in a before-school or after-school program, if and when available, rather than subsidized child-care and development services. During the time that the before-school or after-school program does not operate, such students may be provided the option of enrolling in child-care and development services in accordance with the enrollment priorities established in Administrative Regulation 5148 - Child Care and Development.  (Welfare and Institutions Code 10273)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.To assist in evaluations of program effectiveness, the district may refer to CDE's, "Quality Standards and Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI)," and, "Guidance for a Quality Improvement Process," which describe available assessment tools that are closely aligned with the program standards.To the extent consistent with state and federal privacy laws, Education Code 8484.1 authorizes the district to share specified student data (i.e., school day attendance data, statewide assessment scores, English language development test placement or reclassification scores, California Healthy Kids Survey results in aggregate form, student engagement and behavioral data, and other academic measures, including grades and course completion) with the operator of an after-school program with which the district has a contract that includes a confidentiality agreement. It is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel with questions about the sharing of student data.Additionally, Education Code 8427 and 8484 require the after-school program to submit data on school and program attendance and program quality to CDE; see the section "Reports" in the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall monitor student participation rates and shall identify multiple measures that shall be used to evaluate program effectiveness. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, student outcome data; program self-assessments; feedback from staff, participating students, and parents/guardians; and observations of program activities.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that offer ASES, 21st CCLC, and/or ELO, and may be adapted by districts that offer ASSETs or other programs. Pursuant to Education Code 8482.3 and 46120, a district that offers ASES, 21st CCLC, and/or ELO is required to review program goals, program content, and outcome measures, selected from among those listed in Education Code 8484, every three years and to retain documentation for five years. CDE, through its FPM process, will review whether the program plan has been approved by the Governing Board in a public meeting and posted on the district's website.
Every three years, the Superintendent or designee shall review the after-school program plan, including, but not limited to, program goals, program content, and outcome measures. Documentation of the program plan shall be maintained for a minimum of five years in accordance with law and as specified in Board Policy/Administrative Record 3580 - District Records and Board Policy/Administrative Record 5125 - Student Records.  (Education Code 8482.3, 46120)

Pursuant to Education Code 8482.5, in awarding funding for ASES programs, the state gives priority to schools with at least 50 percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals.

Additionally, 20 USC 7174 and Education Code 8422 and 8484.8 give competitive priority for these federal programs to applications jointly submitted by school districts and community organizations for programs that (1) are located in schools that are implementing comprehensive or targeted support and improvement activities pursuant to 20 USC 6311 or other schools determined by the district to be in need of intervention and support to improve student academic achievement and other outcomes, (2) serve students at risk for academic failure, dropping out of school, involvement in criminal or delinquent activities, or lacking strong positive role models, (3) provide activities not otherwise accessible to participating students or expand accessibility to high-quality services that may be available in the community, (4) continue or expand existing grants, and (5) for 21st CCLC programs, provide year-round expanded learning programming. For a further description of competitive priority for funding, see CDE's, "After School Education and Safety, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, 21st Century High School After School Safety Enrichment for Teens Grant Programs Frequently Asked Questions," and, "Expanded Learning Funding Opportunities," available on its website.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="xMTUOA2" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22xMTUOA2%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22wNQ742%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1733344918%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20following%20optional%20paragraph%20may%20be%20revised%20to%20reflect%20district%20practice.%20Pursuant%20to%20Education%20Code%208482.5%2C%20in%20awarding%20funding%20for%20ASES%20programs%2C%20the%20state%20gives%20priority%20to%20schools%20with%20at%20least%2050%20percent%20of%20students%20eligible%20for%20free%20or%20reduced-price%20meals.%20Pursuant%20to%2020%20USC%207174%2C%20funding%20for%20the%2021st%20CCLC%20and%20ASSETs%20programs%20is%20restricted%20to%20schools%20receiving%20federal%20Title%20I%20funding.%20Additionally%2C%2020%20USC%207174%20and%20Education%20Code%208422%20and%208484.8%20give%20competitive%20priority%20for%20these%20federal%20programs%20to%20applications%20jointly%20submitted%20by%20school%20districts%20and%20community%20organizations%20for%20programs%20that%20%281%29%20are%20located%20in%20schools%20that%20are%20implementing%20comprehensive%20or%20targeted%20support%20and%20improvement%20activities%20pursuant%20to%2020%20USC%206311%20or%20other%20schools%20determined%20by%20the%20district%20to%20be%20in%20need%20of%20intervention%20and%20support%20to%20improve%20student%20academic%20achievement%20and%20other%20outcomes%2C%20%282%29%20serve%20students%20at%20risk%20for%20academic%20failure%2C%20dropping%20out%20of%20school%2C%20involvement%20in%20criminal%20or%20delinquent%20activities%2C%20or%20lacking%20strong%20positive%20role%20models%2C%20%283%29%20provide%20activities%20not%20otherwise%20accessible%20to%20participating%20students%20or%20expand%20accessibility%20to%20high-quality%20services%20that%20may%20be%20available%20in%20the%20community%2C%20%284%29%20continue%20or%20expand%20existing%20grants%2C%20and%20%285%29%20for%2021st%20CCLC%20programs%2C%20provide%20year-round%20expanded%20learning%20programming.%20For%20a%20further%20description%20of%20competitive%20priority%20for%20funding%2C%20see%20CDE%27s%2C%20%5C%22After%20School%20Education%20and%20Safety%2C%2021st%20Century%20Community%20Learning%20Centers%2C%2021st%20Century%20High%20School%20After%20School%20Safety%20Enrichment%20for%20Teens%20Grant%20Programs%20Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%2C%5C%22%20and%2C%20%5C%22Expanded%20Learning%20Funding%20Opportunities%2C%5C%22%20available%20on%20its%20website.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-xMTUOA2" title="CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
