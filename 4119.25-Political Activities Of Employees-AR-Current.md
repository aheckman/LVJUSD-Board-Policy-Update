## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 7055 authorizes the Governing Board to establish rules and regulations related to officers and employees engaging in political activity during working hours and political activities on district premises.
No employee shall be prohibited from soliciting or receiving political funds or contributions to promote the support or defeat of a ballot measure during nonworking time, including before and after school, the lunch period, or other scheduled work intermittency during the school day.  (Education Code 7056)

District employees shall not:

	Use district funds, services, supplies, equipment, work hours, or other public resources to urge the support or defeat of any ballot measure or candidate, including any candidate for election to the Governing Board  (Education Code 7054, 7056; Government Code 8314)
	 
	Use the district's seal in any campaign literature or mass mailing with the intent to deceive voters, including, but not limited to, the use of a reproduction or facsimile of the seal in a manner that creates a misleading, erroneous, or false impression that the document is authorized by the Board, a Board member, or the district  (Elections Code 18304)
	 
	During working hours, solicit or receive any political funds or contributions to promote the passage or defeat of a ballot measure that would affect the rate of pay, hours of work, retirement, civil service or other working conditions  (Education Code 7056)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Items #4-9 below present examples of other types of activities that are not specified in law but would be prohibited as they constitute a use of public funds, services, supplies or equipment.
	During working hours, solicit or receive any political funds or contributions to promote the passage or defeat of other types of ballot measures
	 
	Use district equipment for the preparation or reproduction of political campaign materials
	 
	Post or distribute political campaign materials in classrooms, through distance learning platforms, or on district property
	 
	Disseminate political campaign materials through the district's mail service, e-mail, or staff mailboxes
	 
	Use students to write, address, or distribute political campaign materials
	 
	Present viewpoints on particular candidates or ballot measures in the classroom without giving equal time to the presentation of all perspectives
	
	CSBA NOTE: Optional item #10 below prohibits employees from wearing political buttons during instructional time.  In California Teachers Association v. Governing Board of San Diego, the appellate court concluded that a district may prevent its employees from wearing political buttons in its classrooms and when they are otherwise engaged in providing instruction to the district's students. The ruling in this case applied to both elementary and secondary teachers. This decision supports and expands upon an earlier Attorney General opinion of 1994, which made a similar conclusion regarding elementary teachers only. Districts that decide to allow teachers to wear political buttons during instructional time may not support this activity with public funds nor selectively permit some speech while prohibiting other speech.The authority to prohibit political buttons does not extend to noninstructional time.  Although not binding, in 2001 the Attorney General opined that teachers cannot be prevented from wearing political buttons at Back-to-School Night because it is a noninstructional setting, parents/guardians are less likely than students to be unduly influenced by these political expressions, and teachers' political buttons are not likely to be perceived as reflecting the district's views.In East Whittier School District, the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) found that the wearing of union buttons that favor or oppose any matter that is the subject of negotiations does not constitute a political activity, and that a district policy prohibiting employees from wearing such buttons violated the Educational Employment Relations Act.   See BP 4140/4240/4340 - Bargaining Units.
	Wear buttons, hats, or other articles of clothing that express political opinions on ballot measures or candidates during instructional time

Political Activities of Employee Organizations

CSBA NOTE: In San Leandro Teachers Association v. Governing Board of San Leandro Unified School District, the California Supreme Court held that the district's refusal to permit union communication through school mailboxes which included endorsements of certain school board candidates was within the scope of Education Code 7054. The court concluded that the policy did not violate Government Code 3543.1, which gives school employee organizations the right to use internal mailboxes subject to "reasonable regulation."  It further held that a policy that bans candidate endorsements pursuant to Education Code 7054 to preserve the integrity of the electoral process does not unduly limit a union's statutory right of access nor does it interfere with the union's core mission of advocating for its members.  The court emphasized the narrowness of its holding, and stated that school boards are not prohibited from opening up mailboxes to political endorsement literature as long as this "nonpublic forum" is made available to all sides on an equitable basis. This holding does not extend to literature that merely urges the involvement in upcoming elections and informs union members how to do so, or engages in public policy discussion in more general terms. Also see PERB rulings in Conejo Valley Unified School District and San Diego Community College District.
Employee organizations shall not use district funds, services, supplies, or equipment, such as staff mailboxes or the district mail system, to urge the support or defeat of any ballot measure or candidate, including any candidate for election to the Board.  (Education Code 7054)

No employee organization or its officers, agents, or representatives shall be prohibited from soliciting or receiving political funds or contributions to promote the passage or defeat of a ballot measure during nonworking time, including before and after school, the lunch period, or other scheduled work intermittency during the school day.  (Education Code 7056)
