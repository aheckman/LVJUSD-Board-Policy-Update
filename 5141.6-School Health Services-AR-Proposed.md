Medi-Cal Billing

In order to provide services as a Medi-Cal provider, the District shall enter into and maintain a contract with the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS).  (Welfare and Institutions Code 14132.06; 22 CCR 51051, 51270)

The Superintendent or designee shall develop a plan to ensure that the District and all District subcontractors, provide individuals with speech, vision, and hearing disabilities auxiliary aides and services, to enable those individuals to effectively communicate and participate in the Medi-Cal program. Such auxiliary aides and services may include, but are not limited to, providing written materials in alternative formats, such as braille, large font, audio recordings, or closed captioning.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all practitioners employed by or under contract with the District possess the appropriate license, certification, registration, or credential and provide only those services that are within their scope of practice.  (22 CCR 51190.3, 51270, 51491)

The Superintendent or designee shall submit a claim for Medi-Cal reimbursement whenever the District provides a Medi-Cal-eligible student under age 22 and/or a member of the student's family a covered service specified in 22 CCR 51190.4 or 51360.  (Welfare and Institutions Code 14132.06; 22 CCR 51096, 51098, 51190.1, 51190.4, 51309, 51360, 51535.5)

When the District provides services, or arranges for the provision of services, for treatment of a mental health or substance use disorder for a student at a school site or at an off-campus clinic, mobile counseling service, or similar District-arranged location, the District may seek reimbursement from the student's health care service plan, in accordance with the requirements of Health and Safety Code 1374.722.

The District shall maintain records and supporting documentation including, but not limited to, records of the type and extent of services provided to a Medi-Cal beneficiary in accordance with law.  (22 CCR 51270, 51476)

Any federal funds received by the District as reimbursement for the costs of services under the Medi-Cal billing option shall be reinvested in approved services for students and their families.  The Superintendent or designee shall consult with a local school-linked services collaborative group regarding decisions on reinvestment of federal funds.  (22 CCR 51270)

The Superintendent or designee shall submit an annual report to DHCS to identify participants in the community collaborative, provide a financial summary including reinvestment expenditures, and describe service priorities for the future.  (22 CCR 51270)

Medi-Cal Administrative Activities

The District shall apply for reimbursement for activities identified by DHCS which are related to the administration of the Medi-Cal program. Such activities include, but are not limited to, outreach, translation for Medi-Cal services, facilitation of applications, arrangement of nonemergency and nonmedical transportation of eligible individuals, program planning and policy development, claims coordination and administration, training, and general administration.

Appropriate staff shall receive training in administrative claiming categories and related activities.

To receive reimbursement for Medi-Cal administrative activities, the Superintendent or designee shall, on a quarterly basis, submit an invoice to the local educational consortium or local governmental agency through which the District has contracted.

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall submit to the local educational consortium or local governmental agency, and shall update each quarter, a roster of all employees who perform direct Medi-Cal services or administrative activities. When notified by the local educational consortium or local governmental agency of the date and time that a random-moment time survey must be conducted by a particular employee, the Superintendent or designee shall coordinate the completion and submission of the survey in accordance with DHCS timelines and procedures.

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain an audit file containing random-moment time survey documentation and other records specified by DHCS. Such documentation shall be kept for three years after the end of the quarter in which expenditures were incurred or, if an audit is in progress, until the completion of the audit.
