## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the right of parents/guardians to be involved in the education of their children and desires to balance that right with the District's need to ensure the safety of students while at school.

The parent/guardian who enrolls a child in a District school shall be presumed to be the child's custodial parent/guardian and shall be held responsible for the child's welfare.

School officials shall presume that both parents/guardians have equal rights regarding their child, including, but not limited to, picking the student up after school or otherwise removing the student from school, accessing student records, participating in school activities, or visiting the school.  When a court order restricts access to the child or to his/her student information, a parent/guardian shall provide a copy of the certified court order to the principal or designee upon enrollment or upon a change in circumstances.

In the event of an attempted violation of a court order that restricts access to a student, the principal or designee shall contact the custodial parent and local law enforcement officials and shall make the student available only after one or both of these parties consent.
