## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation may be revised to reflect the district personnel responsible for duties related to attendance supervision and matters related to chronic absence and truancy. Pursuant to Education Code 48240-48246, the district may appoint an attendance supervisor, join a consortium of districts to employ an attendance supervisor, or contract with the County Superintendent of Schools to supervise the attendance of district students. See AR 5113.11 - Attendance Supervision.Education Code 48273 mandates that the district adopt rules and regulations related to reports of district referrals to a school attendance review board (SARB). See the section on "Records" below for language fulfilling this mandate.
Definitions

Chronic absentee means a student who is absent for any reason on 10 percent or more of the school days in the school year, when the total number of days the student is absent is divided by the total number of days the student is enrolled and school was actually taught in the regular schools of the district, exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays.  (Education Code 60901)

Truant means a student who is absent from school without a valid excuse three full days in one school year, or tardy or absent for more than any 30-minute period during the school day without a valid excuse on three occasions in one school year, or any combination thereof.  (Education Code 48260)

Habitual truant means a student who has been reported as a truant three or more times within the same school year, provided the district has made a conscientious effort to hold at least one conference with the student and the student's parent/guardian after either of the two previous reports.  (Education Code 48262, 48264.5)

Chronic truant means a student who has been absent from school without a valid excuse for 10 percent or more of the school days in one school year, from the date of enrollment to the current date, provided the district has met the requirements of Education Code 48260, 48260.5, 48261, 48262, 48263, and 48291.  (Education Code 48263.6)

CSBA NOTE: As provided above, definitions of the various categories of truancy are based on the number of absences from school without a valid excuse. Education Code 48260 defines a "valid excuse," for purposes of classifying a student as a truant, as any of the reasons specified in Education Code 48205 (i.e., illness, quarantine, health services appointments, funeral service attendance, jury duty, illness or medical appointment of student's child, justifiable personal reasons, service on precinct board, time with family member called to active duty or on leave from active duty, and religious exercises), Education Code 48225.5 (i.e., entertainment or allied industries work permits and nonprofit organization performances), or other reasons at the discretion of school administrators. AR 5113 - Absences and Excuses reflects the reasons that students may be excused from school and provides information about methods of verification of student absences.
For purposes of classifying a student as a truant, a valid excuse includes, but is not limited to, the reasons for which a student shall be excused from school pursuant to Education Code 48205 and 48225.5, and Administrative Regulation 5113 - Absences and Excuses. A valid excuse may include other reasons that are within the discretion of school administrators and, based on the facts of the student's circumstances, are deemed to constitute a valid excuse.  (Education Code 48260)

Addressing Chronic Absence

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice.
When a student is identified as a chronic absentee, the Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall communicate with the student and the student's parents/guardians to determine the reason(s) for the excessive absences, ensure the student and parents/guardians are aware of the adverse consequences of poor attendance, and jointly develop a plan for improving the student's school attendance.

The student may be referred to a student success team or school-site attendance review team to assist in evaluating the student's needs and identifying strategies and programs to assist the student. When necessary, the student may be referred to a school attendance review board (SARB) program, a truancy mediation program established by the district attorney or the probation officer, or a comparable program deemed acceptable by the Superintendent or designee, in accordance with Education Code 48263 and Item #3 in "Addressing Truancy" below.

A student who is struggling academically may be offered tutoring or other supplemental instruction, expanded learning opportunities, and/or alternative educational options as appropriate.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49067, the Governing Board may authorize teachers to assign failing grades to students with excessive unexcused absences, with the threshold number of absences established by the Board. See BP 5121 - Grades/Evaluation of Student Achievement. However, CSBA's, "Research-Supported Strategies to Improve the Accuracy and Fairness of Grades," recommends that student absences be dealt with separately from grading and that absences should not be considered in determining a student's level of understanding of course content. The following paragraph is consistent with that recommendation and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Students who are absent shall be given an opportunity to make up missed assignments or assessments and shall receive full credit for satisfactory completion of the work. Students with excessive absences shall be supported to the extent possible to limit the impact of absences on the student's grades.

Whenever chronic absenteeism is linked to a health, social-emotional, family, or other nonschool issue, the Superintendent or designee may recommend school or community resources and/or collaborate with community agencies and organizations to address the needs of the student and the student's family.

Addressing Truancy

An attendance supervisor or designee, peace officer, probation officer, or school administrator or designee may, as applicable, arrest or assume temporary custody during school hours of any minor student found away from home who is absent from school without a valid excuse. Any person arresting or assuming temporary custody of a minor student shall deliver the student and make reports in accordance with Education Code 48265 and 48266.  (Education Code 48264, 48265, 48266)

The Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall investigate a complaint from any person that a parent/guardian has violated the state compulsory education laws contained in Education Code 48200-48341.  (Education Code 48290)

When a student has been identified as a truant as defined above, the following steps shall be implemented based on the number of truancies the student has committed:

	Initial truancy
	 
	
		The student shall be reported to the Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee  (Education Code 48260)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Beginning July 1, 2025, pursuant to Education Code 48260.5, as amended by SB 691 (Ch. 863, Statutes of 2024), when a student is classified as truant, Education Code 48260.5 requires notification to the student's parents/guardians of the following information by the most cost-effective method possible, which may include email or a telephone call. The California Department of Education's (CDE), "School Attendance Review Board: A Road Map for Improved School Attendance and Behavior," provides sample letters.
		The student's parent/guardian shall be notified, by the most cost-effective method possible, which may include email or a telephone call, that:  (Education Code 48260.5)
		 
		
			The student is truant
			 
			The parent/guardian is obligated to compel the student to attend school
			 
			Alternative educational programs are available in the district
			 
			The parent/guardian has the right to meet with appropriate school personnel to discuss solutions to the student's truancy
			 
			Mental health and supportive services may be available to the student and the family
			 
			School personnel are available to meet with the student and family to develop strategies to support the student's attendance at school
			 
			Research shows that missing 10 percent of school for any reason can translate into students having difficulty learning to read by third grade, achieving in middle school, and graduating from high school
			 
		
		
		The student may be required to attend makeup classes on one day of a weekend pursuant to Education Code 37223  (Education Code 48264.5)
		 
		The student and, as appropriate, the student's parent/guardian may be requested to attend a meeting with a school counselor or other school designee to discuss the root causes of the attendance issue and develop a joint plan to improve the student's attendance  (Education Code 48264.5)
		
		CSBA NOTE: The following optional Item #1e is for use by districts in which there is no county SARB and the county's district attorney or probation officer has elected to participate in a truancy mediation program pursuant to Education Code 48260.6.
		The Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee may notify the district attorney and/or probation officer of the student's name and the name and address of the student's parents/guardians  (Education Code 48260.6)
		 
	
	
	Second truancy
	 
	
		Any student who has once been reported as a truant shall again be reported to the Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee as a truant if the student is absent from school without a valid excuse one or more days or is tardy on one or more days during the school year  (Education Code 48261)
		 
		The student may be required to attend makeup classes on one day of a weekend pursuant to Education Code 37223  (Education Code 48264.5)
		 
		The student may be assigned to an after-school or weekend study program within the county and, if the student fails to successfully complete this study program, the student shall be subject to Item #3 below  (Education Code 48264.5)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48262 provides that a student cannot be classified as a habitual truant (Item #3 below) until the district has made a conscientious effort to hold at least one conference with the student and parent/guardian after the attendance supervisor has been notified of either the first or second truancy. Education Code 48262 defines "conscientious effort," for purposes of this section, as attempting to communicate with the parent/guardian at least once using the most cost-effective method possible, which may include email or a telephone call. Thus, the following paragraph requires such communication in the event of the second truancy.
		An appropriate district staff member shall make a conscientious effort to hold at least one conference with the student and the student's parent/guardian by communicating with the parent/guardian at least once using the most cost-effective method possible, which may include email or a telephone call  (Education Code 48262)
		 
		The student may be given a written warning by a peace officer
		
		A record of that warning may be kept at the school for not less than two years or until the student graduates or transfers from the school. If the student transfers, the record may be forwarded to the new school.  (Education Code 48264.5)
		
		CSBA NOTE: The following optional item is for use by districts in which there is no county SARB and the county's district attorney or probation officer has elected to participate in a truancy mediation program. Pursuant to Education Code 48260.6, if the district notifies the district attorney and/or probation officer that a student continues to be classified as a truant after proper notification to the parents/guardians as described in Item #1b above, the district attorney or probation officer may request a meeting with the student and the student's parents/guardians to discuss the possible legal consequences of the student's truancy.
		The Superintendent or designee may notify the district attorney and/or probation officer when the student continues to be classified as a truant after the parents/guardians have been notified in accordance with Item #1b above  (Education Code 48260.6)
		 
	
	
	Third truancy (habitual truancy)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48263 and 48264.5 authorize the district to refer habitual truants, chronic absentees, and students who are habitually insubordinate or disorderly to a SARB, a county truancy mediation program, or a comparable program for services. The district should revise the following items to reflect the option(s) available in the district.According to CDE's, "School Attendance Review Board: A Road Map for Improved School Attendance and Behavior," prior to referring a student to a SARB or county truancy mediation program, some districts initiate an intermediate step, such as a school-site attendance review team or student success team. Districts that have established such an intermediate step may revise the following item accordingly.
	
		A student who is habitually truant, a chronic absentee, or habitually insubordinate or disorderly during attendance at school may be referred to, and required to attend, a SARB program, a truancy mediation program established by the district attorney or the probation officer, or a comparable program deemed acceptable by the Superintendent or designee  (Education Code 48263, 48264.5)
		 
		Upon making a referral to the SARB or the probation department, the Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or other person designated to make the referral shall provide the student, the student's parent/guardian, and SARB or probation department with documentation of the interventions undertaken at the school
		
		Additionally, the attendance supervisor or designee shall provide the student and the student's parent/guardian, in writing, the name and address of the SARB or probation department and the reason for the referral. This notice shall indicate that the student and the student's parent/guardian shall be required, along with the district staff person making the referral, to meet with the SARB or a probation officer to consider a proper disposition of the referral.  (Education Code 48263)
		 
		If the student does not successfully complete the truancy mediation program or other similar program, the student shall be subject to Item #4 below  (Education Code 48264.5)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48263, the SARB or probation officer may direct a student and/or the student's parents/guardians to make use of available community services and may require satisfactory evidence of participation. If the SARB or probation officer determines that available community resources cannot resolve the problem, or if the student and/or the student's parents/guardians have failed to respond to the directives of the SARB or probation officer, the SARB may so notify the district attorney and/or probation officer, or the probation officer may notify the district attorney provided the district attorney or probation officer participates in a truancy mediation program. If the county has not established a SARB, the district may make this finding and notification.The following paragraph is for use by districts in which the county has not established a SARB and the county's district attorney or probation officer has elected to participate in a truancy mediation program.
		If the Superintendent or designee determines that available community services cannot resolve the problem of the truant or insubordinate student or if the student and/or the student's parents/guardians have failed to respond to the directives of the district or to services provided, the Superintendent or designee may so notify the district attorney and/or the probation officer  (Education Code 48263)
		 
	
	
	Fourth truancy
	 
	
		Upon the fourth truancy within the same school year, the student may be referred to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court  (Education Code 48264.5; Welfare and Institutions Code 601)
		
		CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48264.5 and Welfare and Institutions Code 601, a student coming within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court may be adjudged a ward of the court and required to perform community service, pay a fine, and/or attend a court-approved truancy prevention program. In L.A. v. Superior Court of San Diego County, a court of appeal held that juvenile court judges have the authority to imprison a truant as a last resort if the student commits an egregious violation of a court order, less restrictive alternatives have proved ineffective, and the student is confined separately from youths held for criminal violations.
		If a student has been adjudged by the county juvenile court to be a habitual truant, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the juvenile court and the student's probation or parole officer whenever the student is truant or tardy on one or more days without a valid excuse in the same or succeeding school year, or is habitually insubordinate or disorderly at school
		
		The juvenile court and probation or parole officer shall be notified within 10 days of the violation.  (Education Code 48267)
	
	

Attendance Recovery Program

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46211, as added by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), a district may, beginning July 1, 2025, implement an attendance recovery program for students in grades transitional kindergarten (TK)-12 to make up lost instructional time and offset absences, including chronic absenteeism for up to 10 days of attendance in a school year or the number of absences a student accrued in that school year, whichever is less. A student's participation in an attendance recovery program may not be compulsory or punitive for such student. Students participating in an attendance recovery program may generate average daily attendance (ADA) for the school year in which the program is operated, and that otherwise meets the requirements of Education Code 46211.Additionally, Education Code 46211, as amended by AB 176 (Ch.998, Statutes of 2024), limits the attendance credit students may earn under the program to no more than five days of attendance per school week or more than one day of attendance for each calendar day of participation in the program.On or before June 30, 2025, CDE is required to develop and maintain on its website guidance to support districts in creating and implementing a high-quality attendance recovery program.
Beginning July 1, 2025, the district may implement an attendance recovery program for students to make up a maximum of 10 days of attendance for lost instructional time and offset absences incurred during the school year. Any student participating in the program shall not be credited with more than five days of attendance per school week or more than one day of attendance for any calendar day of participation in the program.  (Education Code 46211)

The district's program may be operated before or after school, on weekends, or during intersessional periods. The district shall offer access to an attendance recovery program throughout the school year, including, at least once during each term.  (Education Code 46211)

The program shall be provided only as a limited-term option for a classroom-based, regular educational program. Students otherwise enrolled in a nonclassroom-based program, such as independent study, shall not participate in an attendance recovery program.  (Education Code 46211)

A student shall not be required to participate in the program. Students concurrently participating in both an attendance recovery program and an Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO) pursuant to Education Code 46120, shall retain the ability to participate in the entirety of the ELO's offerings for the duration of the school year.  (Education Code 46211)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46211, as added by SB 153 and amended by AB 176, a district's attendance recovery program must satisfy the requirements specified in the following paragraphs for student participation in the program to generate ADA for the district.
The district's attendance recovery program shall be composed of students engaged in educational activities and content aligned to grade level standards that are substantially equivalent to the students' regular instructional program, which may include one-on-one or small group tutoring, and shall be under the immediate supervision and control of a certificated teacher who is also an employee of the district and who possesses a valid certification document.  (Education Code 46211)

The district's attendance recovery program shall not exceed a student-to-certificated teacher ratio of 10 to 1 for TK and kindergarten or 20 to 1 for grades 1 to 12. The district shall maintain documentation demonstrating how the attendance recovery program met these applicable ratios.  (Education Code 46211)

Records

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. CDE's, "School Attendance Review Board: A Road Map for Improved School Attendance and Behavior," cautions that it is important to keep accurate and complete records of any violations of compulsory school attendance laws because such records may ultimately be introduced as evidence in a trial for truancy.
The Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall maintain accurate attendance records for students identified as habitual or chronic truants. In addition, the attendance supervisor, designee, and/or the staff persons who have direct contact with the student or parent/guardian shall document all their contacts regarding the student's attendance, including a summary of all conversations and a record of all intervention efforts.

The Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall gather and transmit to the County Superintendent of Schools the number and types of referrals made to the SARB and of requests for petitions made to the juvenile court.  (Education Code 48273)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46211, as amended by AB 176, the district is required to maintain documentation of compliance with law as specified below, if the district participates in an attendance recovery program.
Additionally, in regard to the district's attendance recovery program, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain documentation demonstrating how the attendance recovery program met the student-to-teacher ratios specified in Education Code 46211.

<strong>Definitions</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Chronic absentee</em> means a student who is absent for any reason on 10 percent or more of the school days in the school year, when the total number of days the student is absent is divided by the total number of days the student is enrolled and school was actually taught in the regular schools of the district, exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays.&nbsp; (Education Code 60901)<br>
<br>
<em>Truant</em> means a student who is absent from school without a valid excuse three full days in one school year, or tardy or absent for more than any 30-minute period during the school day without a valid excuse on three occasions in one school year, or any combination thereof.&nbsp; (Education Code 48260)<br>
<br>
<em>Habitual truant</em> means a student who has been reported as a truant three or more times within the same school year, provided the district has made a conscientious effort to hold at least one conference with the student and the student&#39;s parent/guardian after either of the two previous reports.&nbsp; (Education Code 48262, 48264.5)<br>
<br>
<em>Chronic truant </em>means a student who has been absent from school without a valid excuse for 10 percent or more of the school days in one school year, from the date of enrollment to the current date, provided the district has met the requirements of Education Code 48260, 48260.5, 48261, 48262, 48263, and 48291.&nbsp; (Education Code 48263.6)<br>
<br>
