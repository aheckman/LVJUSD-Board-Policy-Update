## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board believes that all students have the right to be educated in a safe and positive learning environment free from disruptions. Students shall be expected to exhibit appropriate conduct that does not infringe upon the rights of others or interfere with the school program while on school grounds, going to or coming from school, at school activities, or using district transportation.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each school develops standards of conduct and discipline consistent with Board policies and administrative regulations. Students and parents/guardians shall be notified of district and school rules related to conduct.

CSBA NOTE: The district may modify, delete, or add to the items below to reflect district practice. Also see AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process for conduct that constitutes grounds for suspension or expulsion.
Prohibited student conduct includes, but is not limited to:

	Conduct that endangers students, staff, or others, including, but not limited to, physical violence, possession of a firearm or other weapon, and terrorist threats
	 
	Discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying of students or staff, including sexual harassment, hate-motivated behavior, cyberbullying, hazing or initiation activity, extortion, or any other verbal, written, or physical conduct that causes or threatens to cause violence, bodily harm, or substantial disruption to the school program
	 
	Conduct that disrupts the orderly classroom or school environment
	 
	Willful defiance of staff's authority
	 
	Damage to or theft of property belonging to students, staff, or the district
	 
	Obscene acts or use of profane, vulgar, or abusive language
	 
	Possession, use, or being under the influence of tobacco, alcohol, or other prohibited substances
	
	CSBA NOTE: Penal Code 417.27 prohibits students from possessing laser pointers on school premises, unless the pointer is used for a valid instructional or other school-related purpose, as provided in Item #8 below. Penal Code 417.25 states that aiming or pointing a laser scope (i.e., a portable device capable of projecting a laser light on objects at a distance) at another person in a threatening manner, regardless of whether the laser scope is attached to a firearm, may be a misdemeanor if intended to cause a person fear of bodily harm.
	Possession or use of a laser pointer, unless for a valid instructional or other school-related purpose with prior permission of the principal or designee  (Penal Code 417.27)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48901.5, the district may regulate the use of electronic signaling devices that operate through the transmission or receipt of radio waves, such as paging and signaling equipment. However, student use of such devices may not be prohibited if essential for a student's health.Additionally, pursuant to Education Code 48901.7, as amended by AB 3216 (Ch. 500, Statutes of 2024), the Governing Board is required, by July 1, 2026, to develop in conjunction with students, parents/guardians, and district employees, adopt, and update every five years, a policy to limit or prohibit student use of smartphones while at a school site or under the supervision and control of district employee(s). For more information regarding the limitation or prohibition of student use of smartphones and other mobile communication devices, see BP 5131.8 - Mobile Communication Devices.
	Use of a smartphone or other mobile communication device in an unauthorized manner
	 
	Plagiarism or dishonesty on school work or tests
	 
	Wearing of any attire that violates district or school dress codes, including gang-related apparel
	 
	Tardiness or unexcused absence from school
	 
	Failure to remain on school premises in accordance with school rules
	 
	Other conduct prohibited by Education Code 48900-48915-48915

Employees are expected to enforce standards of conduct and when they observe or receive a report of a violation of these standards, to appropriately intervene, or seek assistance. As necessary, the employee shall refer the matter to a supervisor or the principal or designee.

CSBA NOTE: When school officials want to search a student or a student's belongings, such as a backpack, purse, or computer, as part of an investigation of suspected student misconduct, the legality of the search will depend on whether the search is "reasonable." For more information regarding the search of a student or a student's belongings, see BP/AR 5145.12 - Search and Seizure. The "reasonableness" of a search depends on (1) whether there is individualized suspicion that the search will turn up evidence of a student's violation of the law or school rules, and (2) whether the search is reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the student's age, gender, and/or the nature of the infraction. Additionally, Penal Code 1546.1 prohibits warrantless searches of students' personal electronic devices such as mobile phones, except in narrowly defined circumstances. It is recommended that the district consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel for questions related to the search of a student or the student's belongings.
When a school employee suspects that a search of a student or a student's belongings will turn up evidence of the student's violation of the law or school rules, such a search shall be conducted in accordance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 5145.12 - Search and Seizure.

When a student uses any prohibited device, or uses a permitted device in an unauthorized manner, a district employee may confiscate the device. The employee shall store the device securely until it is returned to the student or turned over to the principal or designee, as appropriate.

Students who violate district or school rules and regulations may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, suspension, expulsion, transfer to alternative programs, referral to a student success team or counseling services, or denial of participation in extracurricular or cocurricular activities or other privileges in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation. The Superintendent or designee shall notify local law enforcement as appropriate.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph addresses students' off-campus conduct during nonschool hours. In general, courts have upheld districts' discipline of students for off-campus conduct that posed a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or school property or presented a risk of substantial disruption of school activities, provided that the district was able to document the impact or disruption that the conduct had, or could be expected to have, on school activities. In addition, courts have analyzed the reasonableness of the district's policy and whether the disciplinary action taken by the district was in proportion to the student's misbehavior.Pursuant to Education Code 48900, districts have the authority to suspend or expel students who engage in cyberbullying off campus, provided that the act meets the criteria specified in the definition of "bullying" in Education Code 48900 (i.e., a severe or pervasive physical or verbal act or conduct that has or can be reasonably predicted to have the effect of placing a reasonable student in fear of harm to the student's person or property, causing a substantially detrimental effect on the student's physical or mental health, causing substantial interference with the student's academic performance, or causing substantial interference with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from school services, activities, or privileges); see BP 5131.2 - Bullying.In adopting policy related to off-campus conduct, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel to ensure that the policy does not violate students' First Amendment rights to freedom of speech or expression. For more information regarding freedom of speech or expression, see BP 5145.2 - Freedom of Speech/Expression.
Students also may be subject to discipline, in accordance with law, Board policy, or administrative regulation, for any off-campus conduct during nonschool hours which poses a threat or danger to the safety of students, staff, or district property, or substantially disrupts school activities.

In addition, courts have analyzed the reasonableness of the district's policy and whether the disciplinary action taken by the district was in proportion to the student's misbehavior.<br><br>Pursuant to Education Code 48900, districts have the authority to suspend or expel students who engage in cyberbullying off campus, provided that the act meets the criteria specified in the definition of "bullying" in Education Code 48900 (i.e., a severe or pervasive physical or verbal act or conduct that has or can be reasonably predicted to have the effect of placing a reasonable student in fear of harm to the student's person or property, causing a substantially detrimental effect on the student's physical or mental health, causing substantial interference with the student's academic performance, or causing substantial interference with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from school services, activities, or privileges); see BP 5131.2 - Bullying.<br><br>In adopting policy related to off-campus conduct, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel to ensure that the policy does not violate students' First Amendment rights to freedom of speech or expression.
