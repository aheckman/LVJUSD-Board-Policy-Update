## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy should be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board recognizes its responsibility to ensure accountability to the public for the performance of the district and each district school. The Board shall regularly review the effectiveness of district programs, personnel, and fiscal operations, with a focus on the capacity to improve student achievement. The Board shall establish appropriate processes and measures to monitor results and to evaluate progress toward accomplishing the district's vision and goals set forth in the local control and accountability plan (LCAP).

CSBA NOTE: California's accountability system, which is based on both state and federal requirements, measures district and school performance on a variety of indicators of school success. 20 USC 6311 requires each state to have an accountability system that incorporates multiple measures, including, but not limited to, statewide assessment results for all students as well as numerically significant subgroups. The California Accountability and Continuous Improvement System consists of both state and local indicators to assist districts in identifying strengths and areas in need of improvement in each priority area addressed by the local control and accountability plan (LCAP). The degree to which districts and schools are meeting these criteria is reflected in the California School Dashboard, which is a color-coded chart that includes the status of performance on the indicators as well as the change in performance from year to year. Education Code 52064.5, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), establishes new deadlines for the California School Dashboard, which impacts the timelines associated with district collection and reporting of data through the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS). The new deadlines can be found on the "CALPADS Calendar," available on the California Department of Education's (CDE) website.CDE notifies schools identified for comprehensive and/or additional targeted support and improvement pursuant to 20 USC 6311.Further information about the Accountability and Continuous Improvement System and the Dashboard can be found on CDE's website.
District and school performance shall be annually evaluated based on multiple measures specified in the California Accountability and Continuous Improvement System as reported on the California School Dashboard.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 114, has been expanded to include long-term English learners as a numerically significant subgroup, separate from English learners. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statues of 2023), a "long-term English learner" is defined as a student who has not attained English language proficiency within seven years of initial classification as an English learner.
The district and each district school shall demonstrate comparable improvement in academic achievement for all numerically significant student subgroups. Numerically significant subgroups include ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, long-term English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and students experiencing homelessness, when the subgroup consists of at least 30 students with a valid test score or 15 foster youth, long-term English learners, or students experiencing homelessness.  (Education Code 52052)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Providing regular reports to the public and receiving input from the public in regard to school and district progress are key components of accountability.Education Code 52060 and 52061 require the district to consult with parents/guardians, students, teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, and employee bargaining units in the development and annual update of the district's LCAP; see BP 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.
The Superintendent shall provide regular reports to the Board and the public regarding district and school performance. Opportunities for feedback from students, parents/guardians, staff, and community members shall be made available as part of any review and evaluation of district programs and operations and as part of the development or annual update of the LCAP.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52071, if the County Superintendent of Schools does not approve the district's LCAP, including the annual update to the LCAP and the budget overview for parents/guardian, or the district fails to meet specified student achievement criteria for numerically significant student subgroups, then technical assistance is required to be provided.  Additionally, Education Code 52071, as amended by SB 114, creates a new basis for technical assistance when a district fails to meet the data submission requirements of Education Code 60900. In this circumstance, technical assistance includes, but is not limited to (1) identifying a district's strengths and weaknesses in regard to state priorities, (2) working collaboratively to secure assistance from academic, programmatic, or fiscal experts to identify and implement effective programs and practices designed to improve performance in any areas of weakness, (3) obtaining timely documentation from the district demonstrating that it has completed the above activities or substantially similar activities, or it has selected another service provider to work with the district to complete the above activities, (4) requesting that the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence (CCEE) provide advice and assistance to the district, (5) reviewing the district's LCAP to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses in the identified goals, actions, and services, with a particular focus on those areas considered to be contributing toward meeting the increased or improved services requirement and all required goals, and (6) reviewing the district's data management policies and collection and submission processes, including monitoring and oversight of the student information system, to ensure the timely submission of accurate data.Pursuant to Education Code 52072, as repealed and added by SB 114, if the district meets the performance criteria for assistance and intervention pursuant to Education Code 52064.5 for three or more student subgroups, or all of the district's subgroups if the district has less than three subgroups, in three out of the four consecutive school years, CCEE will consult with the district and any provider of technical assistance to determine if assistance from CCEE is necessary. Education Code 52072.1, as added by SB 114, provides that, under specified conditions, the Superintendent of Public Instruction may intervene to revise the district's LCAP or budget and/or to stay or rescind any district action, not required by local collective bargaining agreement, that is preventing the district from improving outcomes for all student subgroups.The district may also request technical assistance. For information on technical assistance, see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan and BP 0520 - Intervention in Underperforming Schools.
Evaluation results may be used as a basis for revising district or school goals, updating the LCAP or other comprehensive plans, identifying and developing strategies to address disparities in achievement among student subgroups, implementing programmatic changes, determining the need for additional support and assistance, awarding incentives or rewards, and establishing other performance-based consequences.

The district shall accept technical assistance or other intervention that may be required pursuant to Education Code 52071 or 52072. If the County Superintendent of Schools is required to provide technical assistance to the district, the district shall accept the technical assistance by providing timely documentation to, and maintaining regular communication with, the County Superintendent.  (Education Code 52071)
