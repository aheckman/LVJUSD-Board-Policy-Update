## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board recognizes that children of military families face challenges to their academic success caused by the frequent moves or deployments of their parents/guardians in fulfillment of military service. The district shall provide such students with academic resources, services, and opportunities for extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to all district students.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49700-49704, the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children is applicable to California school districts. Education Code 49700-49701 establish uniform means of assisting children of military families, as defined in the accompanying administrative regulation, by reducing or eliminating the barriers to their educational success caused by the frequent moves and deployments of their parents/guardians. Among other things, Education Code 49701 requires that districts be flexible in applying certain local rules to such students in order to facilitate their enrollment, placement, advancement, eligibility for extracurricular activities, and on-time graduation.
The Superintendent or designee may waive district policies or rules when necessary to facilitate the enrollment, placement, advancement, eligibility for extracurricular activities, or on-time graduation of children of military families, in accordance with the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children as ratified in Education Code 49700-49704.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph reflects a recommendation in the California Department of Education's (CDE) Final Report to the Legislature on the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide information and/or training to administrators, other appropriate district staff, and military families regarding the provisions of the Interstate Compact and the educational rights of children of military families.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Each branch of the military appoints school liaison officers or comparable positions to serve as the primary point of contact for school-related matters. Their duties include coordinating with local school systems and assisting military families with school issues.
The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with parents/guardians, school liaison officers from military installations, and/or other agencies within and outside the state to facilitate the transition of children of military families into and out of the district.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to 20 USC 6311, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (P.L. 114-95), states and districts are required to issue an annual report card which must include state achievement results for students who have parents/guardians who are members of the Armed Forces on active duty or full-time National Guard duty. The CDE has updated the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System to indicate such students. These students will be assigned a national identification number that will facilitate monitoring of their academic progress as they move across military bases and from state to state.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board and the public on the educational outcomes of children of military families. Such reports may include, but are not limited to, school attendance, student achievement test results, promotion and retention rates by grade levels, and graduation rates.
