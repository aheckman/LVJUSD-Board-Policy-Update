## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation should be revised to reflect district practice. The strategies listed below are organized around the "fundamental E's" recommended for inclusion in local programs by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (NHTSA) and the National Center for Safe Routes to School's online resource guide. NHTSA's, "Advancing Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety: A Primer for Highway Safety Professionals," states that the most often addressed E's are engineering, education, and enforcement, with encouragement and engagement, evaluation, emerging technologies, emergency response, and equity as other important E's to consider.
District strategies to improve student safety along routes to school and to promote walking, bicycling, and other forms of active transport to school by students may include:

	Education activities that promote safety and awareness, such as:
	
	CSBA NOTE: To enable the district to provide students safety instruction related to using electric, motorized, or nonmotorized bicycles and scooters, Education Code 51860, as amended by AB 2028 (Ch. 116, Statutes of 2022), authorizes the Governing Board to assist local law enforcement, nonprofit associations or organizations specified in Education Code 38134, such as the Girls Scouts, Boys Scouts,  parent-teacher associations, and public agencies that provide such safety instruction in providing safety instruction to district students. Additionally, Streets and Highways Code 894, as added by AB 1946 (Ch. 147, Statutes of 2022), requires the Department of the California Highway Patrol to develop and post on its website, by September 1, 2023, statewide safety and training programs for users of electric bicycles, including, but not limited to, general electric bicycle riding safety, emergency maneuver skills, rules of the road, and laws pertaining to electric bicycles.

	
		Instructing students about pedestrian and personal safety related to the use of electric or motorized and nonmotorized bicycles or scooters, including by local law enforcement, organizations specified in Education Code 38134, and public agencies that provide safety instructions on such bicycles and scooters.
		 
		Instructing students about the health, academic, and environmental benefits of walking, bicycling, and other forms of active transport to school
		 
		Offering driver safety information to high school students, parents/guardians, and the community to promote safety around school campuses and routes
		 
	
	
	Encouragement strategies designed to generate interest in active transport to school, such as:
	 
	
		Organizing or facilitating "walking school buses" and/or "bicycle trains" whereby students walk or bike to school in groups escorted by parents/guardians or other volunteers as needed
		 
		Organizing special events and activities, such as Walk or Bike to School Day, International Walk to School Month, or year-round competitions
		 
		Publicizing the district's efforts in order to build support of parents/guardians and the community, including providing information about the district's safe routes to school program in parent/guardian communications and in any notifications about transportation options
		 
	
	
	Enforcement strategies to deter unsafe behaviors of drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists, such as:
	 
	
		Initiating or expanding crossing guard, student safety patrol, and/or parent/guardian safety patrol programs
		 
		Partnering with local law enforcement to help ensure that traffic laws are obeyed in the vicinity of schools and to implement appropriate measures such as placement of speed feedback monitors, ticketing, and/or driver safety campaigns
		 
		Monitoring to ensure that students who bicycle to school or who use skateboards, skates, or nonmotorized scooters wear helmets in accordance with Vehicle Code 21212
		 
	
	
	Engineering strategies that address the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of traffic control devices or physical measures, such as:
	 
	
		Working with local government agencies, parents/guardians, school staff, and others as appropriate to gather data about environmental conditions and hazards along routes to school
		 
		Working with local government agencies to make operational and physical improvements that reduce or eliminate hazards, such as reducing motor vehicle traffic speeds in the area and establishing safer and fully accessible crosswalks, walkways, trails, and bikeways
		 
		Assessing the adequacy, accessibility, and safety of bicycle parking at schools and making modifications as needed, such as increasing the number of or relocating bicycle racks and/or equipment storage areas
		 
		Considering safe routes to school when making decisions about siting and designing of new schools
		
		CSBA NOTE: See the accompanying Board policy for additional information about program evaluation, including examples of indicators that may be used to measure program implementation and effectiveness.
	
	
	Evaluation to assess progress toward program goals, including:
	 
	
		Gathering and interpreting data based on indicators established by the Superintendent and the Governing Board
		 
		Presenting data to the Board, program partners, and the public
		 
		Recommending program modifications as needed
		 
	
	
	Emerging technologies that aid in the prevention and mitigation of accidents
	 
	Emergency response in managing injuries after an accident occurs, including, but not limited to, training staff, crossing guards, student and/or parent/guardian safety patrols, and other volunteers who assist with drop-off and pick-up in emergency procedures
	 
	Equity, such that resources are distributed in a manner that provides safe access and participation in an equitable manner across the community
