## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy and accompanying administrative regulation are for use by districts that maintain high schools. High school and unified districts are required by Education Code 48432 to establish and maintain continuation education schools or classes whenever there are any students residing in the district who are subject to compulsory continuation education; see the accompanying administrative regulation for conditions of compulsory continuation education.Pursuant to Education Code 48432 and 5 CCR 11010, a district may apply to the California Department of Education (CDE) for an annual exemption from the requirement to provide continuation education for a district school under either of the following circumstances: (1) there are fewer than 100 students enrolled in grade 12 in any high school in the district, or (2) the school has more than 100 students in grade 12 and the district has entered into an agreement with another high school district or unified district to maintain continuation education classes for minors residing in either district and such minors do not have to travel an excessive distance from their homes to the continuation education classes.AB 97 (Ch. 47, Statutes of 2013) eliminated the Pupil Retention Block Grant (Education Code 41505-41508), which included funding for the continuation high school foundation program, and redirected that funding into the local control funding formula.The following paragraph reflects the intended purposes of continuation schools and classes as expressed in Education Code 48430 and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board shall provide a continuation education program as an option for at-risk students who may need a flexible educational environment.  The continuation education program shall be designed to meet the educational needs of each student, provide an opportunity for participating students to complete the required course of instruction necessary to graduate from high school, emphasize occupational orientation or a work study schedule, and offer intensive guidance services.

The continuation education program shall be aligned with the goals identified in the district's local control and accountability plan, designed and implemented in collaboration with other high schools within the district, and coordinated with other educational options available to district students.

The Superintendent or designee shall appoint a director of continuation education who shall be responsible for the organization and administration of the district's continuation education program and guidance, placement, and follow-up services for participating students.  (5 CCR 11000, 11003)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect the school calendar adopted by the Governing Board for continuation high schools.
The continuation high school shall be conducted for not less than 175 days during a school year.  The Board may maintain continuation classes during the district's regular school hours, during special school hours for these classes established by the Board, or during such hours and for such length of time during the day or evening that adult education classes are maintained.  (Education Code 48434; 5 CCR 11004)

Students eligible for continuation education classes shall be age 16 or 17 years at the time of their enrollment and shall not have graduated from high school.  (Education Code 48400, 48413)

CSBA NOTE: Districts that assign students to continuation schools are mandated by Education Code 48432.5 to adopt rules and regulations governing procedures for involuntary transfer of students to continuation schools; also see the accompanying administrative regulation.
A student may be involuntarily transferred into a continuation education program in accordance with law and administrative regulation.  (Education Code 48432.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that choose to allow students to voluntarily enroll in a continuation school, with the approval of the Superintendent or designee, as authorized by Education Code 48432 and 48432.5. Such districts are mandated pursuant to Education Code 48432.3, as added by AB 570 (Ch. 365, Statutes of 2013), to adopt policy and procedures containing specified provisions and governing the identification, placement, and intake procedures for these students; also see the accompanying administrative regulation.
With the consent of the Superintendent or designee, a student may voluntarily enroll in continuation classes in order to receive special attention such as individualized instruction. (Education Code 48432, 48432.3, 48432.5)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48432.3, as added by AB 570 (Ch. 365, Statutes of 2013), mandates that the district's policy and procedures ensure there is a clear criterion for determining which students may voluntarily transfer or be recommended for transfer to a continuation school and that this criterion is nonarbitrarily and consistently applied districtwide.The John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities, in its publication Intake Processes at Continuation High Schools: Shaping School Climate Through Selection and Enrollment Strategies, notes that selection policies may range from providing open access to all interested students to establishing criteria that restrict enrollment to a subgroup of students based on academic and/or behavioral criteria. In determining student eligibility criteria, the district might consider (1) the goals and focus of each continuation high school in the district and (2) the availability of other educational options within the district or county and the student populations they are intended to serve. The following paragraph reflects types of students who frequently benefit from enrollment in continuation education, according to the CDE web site, and should be revised to reflect specific criteria established by the district.
Priority for voluntary enrollment in continuation classes shall be given to students who need credit recovery in order to graduate with their peers and to students who, due to employment, pregnancy, parenting responsibilities, or other circumstances, are unable to attend a comprehensive high school. A student with a disability shall be admitted only if his/her individualized education program specifically states that a continuation high school setting meets his/her needs.

Enrollment criteria shall be applied consistently throughout the district.  (Education Code 48432.3)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. If there is a regional occupational center or program (ROC/P) within the county, Education Code 48432 authorizes the district to enroll students in the ROC/P who would otherwise be subject to compulsory continuation education.
Students may be enrolled in a regional occupational center or program within the county in lieu of, or in combination with, continuation education.  (Education Code 48432)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48410 specifies conditions under which students may be exempted from attendance in continuation education. These conditions are delineated in AR 5112.1 - Exemptions from Attendance.
Students otherwise subject to compulsory attendance in continuation education classes may be exempted if they meet any of the conditions specified in Education Code 48410 and AR 5112.1 - Exemptions from Attendance.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly evaluate the effectiveness of district continuation education programs and report these evaluation results to the Board.  Indicators may include, but not be limited to, disaggregated data on student enrollment, student assessment results, and graduation rates.
