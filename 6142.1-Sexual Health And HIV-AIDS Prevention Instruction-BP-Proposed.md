## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide a well-planned, integrated sequence of medically accurate and inclusive instruction on comprehensive sexual health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention. The District's educational program shall address the goals of the California Healthy Youth Act pursuant to Education Code 51930-51939, including providing students with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect them from risks presented by sexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancy, sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual abuse, and human trafficking and to have healthy, positive, and safe relationships and behaviors. The District's educational program shall also promote students' understanding of sexuality as a normal part of human development and their development of healthy attitudes and behaviors concerning adolescent growth and development, body image, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, relationships, marriage, and family.

The District shall respect the rights of parents/guardians to supervise their children's education on these subjects and to impart values regarding human sexuality to their children.

Comprehensive sexual health education and HIV prevention education shall be offered to all students in grades 7-12 at least once in junior high or middle school and at least once in high school.  (Education Code 51934)

The District's comprehensive sexual health education program shall include information on the affirmative consent standard. Affirmative consent is defined as affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.  Teachers delivering such instruction shall consult information related to sexual harassment and violence in the state health curriculum framework.  (Education Code 51225.36, 67386)

The Superintendent or designee shall identify appropriate methods for informing the school community about subjects related to the District's comprehensive sexual health and HIV prevention education.  The Superintendent or designee shall use such identified methods to inform parents/guardians of students in grades 6-12 about human trafficking prevention resources, as required pursuant to Education Code 49381.

Parent/Guardian Consent

At the beginning of each school year or at the time of a student's enrollment, parents/guardians shall be notified, in the manner specified in the accompanying administrative regulation, that they may request in writing that their child be excused from participating in comprehensive sexual health and HIV prevention education. Students so excused by their parents/guardians shall be given an alternative educational activity.  (Education Code 51240, 51938, 51939)

A student shall not be subject to disciplinary action, academic penalty, or other sanction if the student's parent/guardian declines to permit the student to receive the instruction.  (Education Code 51939)
