## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.3 requires the Board to adopt alternative means for students to complete the prescribed course of study. Pursuant to Education Code 52017, the school improvement plan shall include a process whereby students may demonstrate proficiency in any aspect of the curriculum in order to waive course-hour requirements and pursue an elective course of study.
The Governing Board recognizes that there is a need to allow high school students to challenge a given course by examination for grade and credit in order to accelerate progress towards graduation and to achieve more flexibility in the selection of electives.  This opportunity will permit a student to enroll in courses best suited to his/her educational objectives. 

The examination shall be comprehensive and cover all course objectives.  Successful completion of the examination shall be at a level which indicates mastery of the content and/or reasonable chance for success in the next higher course.
