CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 80033, as added by Register 2014, No. 7, every approved intern program must have a signed memorandum of understanding between the district and the college/university teacher preparation program in which interns participate. The memorandum of understanding must detail the support and supervision that will be provided to interns. For requirements related to support and supervision, see the section "Support and Supervision of Interns" below.
Before interns employed by the district assume daily teaching responsibilities, a signed memorandum of understanding shall be in place between the district and the partner college/university detailing the support and supervision that will be provided to interns.  (5 CCR 80033)

CSBA NOTE: Optional items #1-6 below summarize the major components which the CTC, in its Program Sponsor Alert 13-06, recommends should be addressed in the memorandum of understanding.  The district may add other components and/or describe the components in more detail.
The memorandum of understanding shall include, but not be limited to:

	Specific responsibilities of the program supervisor
	 
	Qualifications, identification, terms of employment, roles and responsibilities, and training of individual(s) to provide on-site support to interns
	 
	Allocation of additional personnel, time, and resources for interns who have not yet earned an English learner authorization
	 
	Expectations regarding the type and frequency of support
	 
	The process of communication between the program supervisor and on-site support personnel
	 
	Documentation, monitoring, and evaluation of site support

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44461-44462, a district participating in a university intern program may enter into an agreement to employ college/university staff to supervise interns and may pay for such supervision out of district funds under the conditions specified below. The district may choose to extend these provisions to interns participating in a district intern program.
The district may enter into an agreement to employ college/university staff to supervise interns and may pay for the supervision of interns out of district funds. Salary payments may be met by proportionately reducing the salaries of paid interns, provided that no more than eight interns are supervised by one staff member, the district salary normally paid to interns is not reduced by more than one-eighth, and the intern is not paid less than the minimum salary required by the state for a regularly certificated teacher.  (Education Code 44461-44462)

Support and Supervision of Interns

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph reflects CTC program standards for intern programs.
The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with the college/university teacher preparation program to design structured guidance of interns, regular site-based support and supervision, and a sequence of supervised fieldwork that includes planned observations, consultations, reflections, and individual and small-group teaching opportunities.

Support and supervision provided to interns shall include the following: (Education Code 44830.3; 5 CCR 80033)
CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44830.3, 5 CCR 80033 as added by Register 2014, No. 7, and the preconditions established by the CTC for program approval, the district and college/university must develop and implement a professional development plan whenever it employs interns participating in any CTC-approved intern program.


	Professional Development Plan:  The Superintendent or designee shall, in cooperation with the college/university, counsel each intern and, with the concurrence of the intern, shall develop a plan for the intern to complete the requirements to earn a credential in the content or specialty area(s) of the intern credential.
	
	The plan shall include the components described in Education Code 44830.3,including, but not limited to, provisions for at least 120 clock hours (or the semester or quarter unit equivalent) of mandatory preservice training tailored to the grade level or class to be taught, additional instruction during the first semester or first year of service when required, and an annual evaluation of the intern.
	 
	Assignment of Mentor Teacher: Before an intern assumes daily teaching responsibilities, the Superintendent or designee shall assign him/her a mentor teacher who possesses a valid corresponding life or clear teaching credential and a minimum of three years of successful teaching experience.
	
	CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph reflects CTC program standards for intern programs and may be revised to reflect district practice.
	The intern shall receive support from a mentor teacher who is assigned to the same school. If two or more mentor teachers are assigned to an intern, at least one of them shall be experienced in the curricular area(s) of the intern's assignment.
	 
	Support During School Year: Support and supervision shall include coaching, modeling, and demonstrating within the classroom. In addition, the intern shall receive assistance with course planning and with problem-solving regarding students, curriculum, and effective teaching methodologies.
	
	Such support and supervision shall be provided for a minimum of 144 hours per school year or, for late hires, four hours multiplied by the number of instructional weeks remaining in the school year.  At least two hours of support and supervision shall be provided every five instructional days.
	 
	Additional Support Addressing the Needs of English Learners:  For any intern who enters the intern program without a valid English learner authorization, bilingual authorization, or crosscultural, language, and academic development certificate, the Superintendent or designee shall identify an individual who will be immediately available to assist the intern with planning lessons that are appropriately designed and differentiated for English learners, for assessing language needs and progress, and for support of language-accessible instruction through in-classroom modeling and coaching as needed. This individual may be the same mentor identified in item #2 above, provided he/she possesses an English learner authorization and will be immediately available to assist the intern.

In addition, the district and college/university shall provide such interns with additional support and supervision, including in-classroom coaching, specific to the needs of English learners. Such support and supervision shall be provided for 45 hours per school year or, for late hires, five hours multiplied by the number of months remaining in the school year.

An intern who passes the California Teaching English Learners examinations may be exempted from these requirements.

Early Completion Option

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44468 requires all intern programs to provide interns an opportunity to challenge the coursework requirements and to demonstrate teaching skills through performance assessments. This option is currently available for interns preparing for either a multiple or single subject teaching credential, but is not available for interns preparing for an education specialist credential.
The Superintendent or designee shall inform qualified interns preparing for a multiple or single subject credential of the early completion option which allows them to challenge certain requirements of the intern program in areas where they have demonstrated competence.

CSBA NOTE: All interns choosing the early completion option must fulfill the qualifications required of all interns (i.e., possess bachelor's degree or higher, satisfy basic skills requirement, complete a course or pass an exam related to the U.S. Constitution, demonstrate subject matter knowledge in the subject to be taught, meet requirements for teacher fitness including submission of LiveScan fingerprinting, have an offer of employment with the district, and be enrolled in an intern program) as well as the additional requirements specified in Education Code 44468. These include requirements to complete the CTC-approved assessment of knowledge of teaching foundations (the National Evaluation Series Assessment of Professional Knowledge), the CTC-approved Teaching Performance Assessment, the reading instruction competence assessment for interns pursuing a multiple subject credential, and foundational computer technology coursework. The candidate must also be recommended by the intern program sponsor. For further information, see CTC's leaflet CL-840 Early Completion Option.According to the CTC leaflet, the district may require additional instruction deemed necessary for the preparation of the candidate. The following paragraph may be revised to list any such additional district requirements
In order to complete the intern program early and be recommended for a preliminary credential, candidates shall meet all requirements of the intern credential and the additional assessments and coursework specified in Education Code 44468.
