## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation is for use when the Governing Board has adopted a resolution to use the alternative procedures of the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (UPCCAA) (Public Contract Code 22000-22045) for awarding public works projects; see the accompanying Board policy.According to the California Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Commission's, "Frequently Asked Questions," available on its website, a district participating in UPCCAA is subject to other requirements of the Public Contract Code in areas where UPCCAA is silent. See BP/AR 3311 - Bids for traditional bidding procedures pursuant to Public Contract Code 20110-20118.4.Pursuant to Public Contract Code 22002, as amended by AB 2192 (Ch. 953, Statutes of 2024), the definition of "public project" was expanded to include "installation," which is reflected in the following definition.
Public project, in regard to the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (UPCCAA), means any of the following:  (Public Contract Code 22002)


	Construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, alteration, renovation, improvement, demolition, and repair work involving any district-owned, leased, or operated facility
	 
	Painting or repainting of any district-owned, leased, or operated facility

CSBA NOTE:  Public Contract Code 22032, as amended by AB 2192, establishes the following requirements based on the amount of the public project. Pursuant to Public Contract Code 22020, the Commission reviews these monetary limits every five years and recommends to the State Controller whether they need to be adjusted. The following represents the increase to bid limit threshold effective January 1, 2025. The State Controller is required to notify all participating public agencies of any adjustment to these limits prior to the effective date.
Procedures for awarding contracts for public works projects shall be determined on the basis of the amount of the project, as follows:

	Public projects of $75,000 or less may be performed by district employees by force account, negotiated contract, or purchase order  (Public Contract Code 22032)
	
	CSBA NOTE:  Public Contract Code 22034, as amended by AB 2192, requires any public agency participating in UPCCAA to adopt an informal bidding ordinance, with specified components, to govern the selection of contractors to perform public projects of $220,000 or less, as described in Item #2 below. The Commission's "Frequently Asked Questions," advise that districts and other agencies that cannot legally adopt ordinances discuss compliance with legal counsel.The district may revise Item #2a to reflect the method(s) of notification of contractors used by the district.
	Contracts for public projects of $220,000 or less may be awarded through the following informal procedures:  (Public Contract Code 22032, 22034, 22038)
	 
	
		The Superintendent or designee shall prepare a notice inviting informal bids, which describes the project in general terms, explains how to obtain further information about the project, and states the time and place for the submission of bids
		
		This notice shall be disseminated by mail, fax, or email to either or both of the following:
		 
		
			All contractors on a list of qualified contractors maintained by the district for the category of work being bid, unless the product or service is proprietary, at least 10 calendar days before bids are due
			 
			All construction trade journals identified pursuant to Public Contract Code 22036
			 
		
		
		The district shall review the informal bids that were submitted and award the contract as follows:
		 
		
			The contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder
			
			If two or more bids are the same and the lowest, the district may accept the one it chooses.
			 
			If all bids received through the informal process are in excess of $220,000, the contract may be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, provided that the Governing Board adopts a resolution with a four-fifths vote to award the contract at $235,000 or less and the Board determines the district's cost estimate is reasonable
			 
			At its discretion, the district may reject all bids presented and declare that the project can be more economically performed by district employees, provided that the district notifies an apparent low bidder, in writing, of the district's intention to reject the bid
			
			Such notice shall be mailed at least two business days prior to the hearing at which the district intends to reject the bid.
			 
			If no bids are received through the informal bid procedure, the project may be performed by district employees by force account or negotiated contract
			 
		
		
	
	
	Public projects of more than $220,000 shall, except as otherwise provided by law, be subject to formal bidding procedures, as follows:  (Public Contract Code 22032, 22037, 22038)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Public Contract Code 22037, if there is no newspaper of general circulation published in the jurisdiction of the district, the district is required to post the bid notice in three locations as described below. Public Contract Code 22037 requires that these locations be identified in the agency's ordinance or regulation. Item #3a(1) may be revised to include such locations.
	
		The Superintendent or designee shall prepare a notice inviting formal bids, which states the time and place for receiving and opening sealed bids and distinctly describe the project
		The notice shall be disseminated in both of the following ways:
		 
		
			Through publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the district's jurisdiction or, if there is no such newspaper, then by posting the notice in at least three places designated by the district as places for posting its notices
			
			Such notice shall be published at least 14 calendar days before the date that bids will be opened.
			 
			By mail and electronically, if available, by either fax or email, to all construction trade journals identified pursuant to Public Contract Code 22036
			
			Such notice shall be sent at least 15 calendar days before the date that bids will be opened.
			
			In addition to the notice required above, the district may give such other notice as it deems proper.
			 
		
		
		The district shall review the formal bids that were submitted and award the contract as follows:
		 
		
			The contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder
			
			If two or more bids are the same and the lowest, the district may accept the one it chooses.
			 
			At its discretion, the district may reject all bids presented and declare that the project can be more economically performed by district employees, provided that the district notifies an apparent low bidder, in writing, of the district's intention to reject the bid
			
			Such notice shall be mailed at least two business days prior to the hearing at which the district intends to reject the bid.
			 
			If no bids are received through the formal bid procedure, the project may be performed by district employees by force account or negotiated contract
