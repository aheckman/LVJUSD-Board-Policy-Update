## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: In certain limited circumstances, state law permits districts to withhold student grades, diplomas, and/or transcripts. Pursuant to Education Code 48904, the district may withhold the grades, diploma, and/or transcripts of a student who willfully cuts, defaces, or otherwise injures any real or personal property belonging to the district, or who willfully does not return district property that was loaned to the student, until the damages are paid. For more information regarding limits of damages, as annually adjusted for inflation, see BP/AR 3515.4 - Recovery for Property Loss or Damage. Pursuant to Education Code 49014, as added by AB 1974 (Ch. 577, Statutes of 2018), a current or former homeless or foster youth is exempted from the requirement to pay damages.If a student's parents/guardians are unable to pay the damages, Education Code 48904 requires the district to offer an option for the student to provide work in lieu of payment. Pursuant to Education Code 49014, a district may offer any other student regardless of the ability to pay, other than a current or former homeless or foster youth, alternative, nonmonetary means to settle the debt owed as a result of damage or loss of district property. In such cases, the district may withhold the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts until the work or other alternative is completed.Education Code 48904 mandates the Governing Board to establish procedures for withholding a student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts until reparation is made.
When a minor student willfully cuts, defaces, or otherwise injures real or personal property of the district or willfully does not return district property that has been loaned to the student, the student's parents/guardians may be required to pay the costs of all damages within the limits established pursuant to Education Code 48904. Until the student's parents/guardians have paid for the damages or the student has completed voluntary work or other nonmonetary alternative offered by the district in lieu of monetary damages, the Superintendent or designee may withhold the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts.  (Education Code 48904, 49014)

This administrative regulation shall not apply to a student who is a current or former homeless or foster youth.  (Education Code 49014)

Before withholding a student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts, the Superintendent or designee shall inform the student's parents/guardians in writing of the student's alleged misconduct.  (Education Code 48904)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48904 mandates that the district's procedures for withholding a student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts conform to procedures established in the Education Code for student expulsion. For due process procedures related to student expulsion, see BP/AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process.
The student shall be afforded due process consistent with procedures established for the expulsion of students.  (Education Code 48904)

When a student who is transferring into the district has had grades, a diploma, and/or transcripts withheld by the previous district, the Superintendent or designee shall continue to withhold the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts until notified by the previous district that the decision to withhold has been rescinded.  (Education Code 48904.3)

Upon receiving notice that a student whose grades, diploma, and/or transcripts have been withheld by this district has transferred to another district in California, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the student's records to the new district and notify the new district that the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts are being withheld from the student and parents/guardians pursuant to Education Code 48904.

The Superintendent or designee shall also notify the student's parents/guardians in writing that the decision to withhold the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts will be enforced by the new district.  (Education Code 48904.3)
