The Board should adopt a resolution or policy language specifying the time periods at which community college classes may be offered and open to the general public. Boards that adopt such a resolution or policy should establish procedures for members of the general public who are enrolled in community college classes to register immediately upon entering school buildings or grounds, and may want to review their policies regarding visitors to campus, student and staff safety, and campus security, including BP/AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan, BP/AR 1250 - Visitors/Outsiders, BP/AR 3515 - Campus Security, BP/AR 4157/4257/4357 - Employee Safety, and BP/AR 5142 - Safety.
