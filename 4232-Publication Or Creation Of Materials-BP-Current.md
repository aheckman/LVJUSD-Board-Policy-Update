## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be modified to reflect district practice.  In general, federal copyright law provides that the owner of the copyright is the creator of the work.  However, 17 USC 201 specifies that the employer is the copyright holder of a "work for hire" created by an employee within the scope of his/her employment.  Examples of a "work for hire" may include an instructional text, test, computer program, or web design.  Although the district is the owner of a copyright of a "work for hire," 17 USC 201 authorizes the employee and district to enter into an agreement to transfer ownership of the copyright to the employee, jointly to the district and employee, or to a third party.This topic may also be a subject of collective bargaining agreements.
The Governing Board recognizes the importance of creating a work environment that encourages employee innovation in creating and developing high-quality materials to improve student achievement and the efficiency of district operations. 

The Superintendent or designee shall oversee the development of instructional materials, computer programs, and other copyrightable materials by employees, independent contractors, and consultants.  An employee, independent contractor, or consultant shall notify the Superintendent or designee of his/her intent to publish or register a work developed in whole or in part within the scope of his/her employment. 

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 60076 authorizes the district to claim royalties or other compensation for instructional materials when the materials were written or prepared during the normal school day during which the employee was required to be on duty.
Instructional materials, computer programs, and other copyrightable materials developed by an employee within the scope of his/her employment shall be the property of the district.

If an employee has developed copyrightable material during both work and non-working hours, and the work was within the scope of his/her employment, the Superintendent or designee shall negotiate a contract with the employee to protect the district's right as to the ownership or partial ownership of the copyright. 

CSBA NOTE: Courts have held that materials created by independent contractors or consultants are not a "work for hire" within the definition of 17 USC 201.  Thus, whenever a district contracts with a consultant to prepare any type of material, it is recommended that a written contract be developed outlining the respective rights of the parties with regard to the copyright of the materials.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any contract with an independent contractor or consultant contains a provision specifying the district's right to ownership of the copyright of any work produced by the contractor or consultant for the district.

The Superintendent or designee may secure copyrights in the name of the district for all copyrightable works developed by the district.  All royalties or revenues from these copyrights shall be used for the benefit of the district.  (Education Code 35170)
