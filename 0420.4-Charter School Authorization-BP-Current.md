## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 47600-47616.7 authorize the establishment of public charter schools, which are generally exempt from the Education Code unless otherwise specified in law. To establish a charter school within the district, petitioners must submit to the Governing Board for approval a petition which includes all components required by law as described in the accompanying administrative regulation. The following policy reflects the criteria and procedures required by Education Code 47605.Under certain circumstances, charter petitions may also be approved by other governmental entities. For example, Education Code 47605.5-47605.6 require petitioners to submit a petition directly to the County Board of Education when (1) the charter school will serve students for whom the county office of education would otherwise be responsible for providing direct education and related services or (2) the countywide program will provide educational services to a student population that cannot be served as well by a charter school operating in only one district in the county.Pursuant to Education Code 47606, a district may petition the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the State Board of Education (SBE) to convert all its schools to charter schools, provided that 50 percent of the district's teachers sign the petition, the petition contains all specified components, and arrangements are made for alternative attendance of students residing within the district who choose not to attend a charter school.For further information regarding the submission and review of charter school petitions, see CSBA's, "Charter Schools: A Guide for Governance Teams." CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services attorneys can also assist with petition reviews for districts that subscribe to that service.
The Governing Board recognizes that charter schools may assist the district in offering diverse learning opportunities for students. In considering any petition to establish a charter school within the district, the Board shall give thoughtful consideration to the potential of the charter school to provide students with a high-quality education that enables them to achieve to their fullest potential.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47605 allows for Board approval of a start-up charter school or the conversion of an existing public school into a charter school, provided that the school adopts and maintains a policy giving admission preference to students who reside within the former attendance area of that public school. The signature requirement differs for each type of charter school; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
One or more persons may submit a petition to the Board for a charter school to be established within the district or for the conversion of an existing district school to a charter school.  (Education Code 47605)

Any petition for a charter school shall include all components, signatures, and statements required by law, as specified in the accompanying administrative regulation. The proposed charter shall be attached to the petition.  (Education Code 47605)

The Superintendent or designee shall consult with legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding compliance of the charter petition with legal requirements.

The Superintendent or designee may work with charter school petitioners prior to the formal submission of the petition in order to ensure compliance of the petition with legal requirements. As needed, the Superintendent or designee may also meet with the petitioners to establish workable plans for contracted services which the district may provide to the proposed charter school.

The Board shall not require any district student to attend the charter school nor shall it require any district employee to work at the charter school.  (Education Code 47605)

Timelines for Board Action

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47605, the Board is required to hold a public hearing within 60 days of receiving a charter petition to determine the level of support for the petition, and to hold a public hearing within 90 days to take final action on the petition. Education Code 47605 also requires the district to publish, at least 15 days prior to the public hearing at which the Board will grant or deny the petition, staff recommendations regarding the petition and, if applicable, the certification from the County Superintendent of Schools regarding the potential fiscal impact of the charter school on the district.To provide adequate opportunity for public input and thoughtful consideration of the charter petition, it is recommended that the Board conduct two public hearings -- one hearing to determine the level of support for the petition and, following the publication of staff recommendations, a second hearing to grant or deny the petition. However, the law does not explicitly require two hearings, and it may be possible to hold one public hearing to both determine the level of support for the petition and grant or deny the petition, provided that staff recommendations are published 15 days prior to the hearing, the hearing is held within 60 days of receipt of the petition, and the petitioners have equal time and opportunity to present evidence and testimony. CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel should be consulted as needed to ensure that all requirements are met.
Within 60 days of receiving a charter petition, the Board shall hold a public hearing on the charter provisions, at which time the Board shall consider the level of support for the petition by district teachers, other district employees, and parents/guardians. A petition is deemed received on the day the petitioner submits a petition to the district office, along with a signed certification that the petitioner deems the petition to be complete.  (Education Code 47605)

The Board shall either grant or deny the petition at a public hearing held within 90 days of receiving the petition, or within 120 days with the consent of both the petitioner and the Board.  (Education Code 47605)

At least 15 days before the public hearing at which the Board will grant or deny the charter, the district shall publish all staff recommendations regarding the petition, including any recommended findings and, if applicable, certification from the County Superintendent of Schools regarding the potential fiscal impact of the charter school on the district. During the public hearing, the petitioners shall have equal time and opportunity to present evidence and testimony in response to the staff recommendations and findings.  (Education Code 47605)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 47605 requires that, in the event that a petition is denied and the matter is appealed, the Board must provide a documentary record to the petitioner, including a transcript of the public hearing at which the Board denied the hearing. See section on "Appeals" below. Thus, it may be useful to have a transcription of the hearing(s) in the event that the petitioners later appeal the decision of the Board.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain accurate records, in relation to each charter petition, of documents submitted, the Board's proceedings, and the findings upon which the Board's decision is made.

Approval of Petition

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 47605 requires the Board to give preference to charter petitions that demonstrate the capability to provide comprehensive learning experiences to students identified by the petitioner as academically low achieving based on the standards established by the California Department of Education (CDE) pursuant to Education Code 54032, as that section read before July 19, 2006. Prior to its repeal on that date, Education Code 54032 required CDE to develop standards to identify students as academically low achieving for purposes of allocating Economic Impact Aid funds to school sites. However, the Economic Impact Aid program is no longer funded or administered by CDE.Pursuant to Education Code 47605, the Board must also consider the interests of the community in which the school is proposing to locate.
A charter petition shall be granted only if the Board is satisfied that doing so is consistent with sound educational practice and the interests of the community in which the school is proposing to locate. In granting charters, the Board shall consider the academic needs of the students the charter school proposes to serve and shall give preference to petitions that demonstrate the capability to provide comprehensive learning experiences for students who are identified by the petitioner as academically low-achieving, based on standards established by California Department of Education (CDE).  (Education Code 47605)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47604.1, charter schools are subject to the Brown Act (Government Code 54950-54963), California Public Records Act (Government Code 7920.000 - 7930.215), conflict of interest laws (Government Code 1090-1099), and the Political Reform Act (Government Code 81000-91014).
Prior to authorizing any charter, the Board shall verify that the charter includes adequate processes and measures for monitoring and holding the school accountable for fulfilling the terms of its charter and complying with all applicable laws, including Education Code 47604.1. Such processes and measures shall include, but are not limited to, fiscal accountability systems, multiple measures for evaluating the educational program, inspection and observations of any part of the charter school, and regular reports to the Board.

The approval or denial of a charter petition shall not be controlled by collective bargaining agreements nor subject to review or regulation by the Public Employment Relations Board.  (Education Code 47611.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Although not required by law, CSBA's, "Charter Schools:  A Guide for Governance Teams," recommends one or more memoranda of understanding (MOUs) to address matters that are related to the charter petition but are not included in the petition, and to establish expectations for which the charter school can be held accountable. CSBA's manual provides examples of issues that might be addressed in an MOU, including business operations, facilities, administrative and support services, special education, student assessment, and athletics. See CDE's web site for sample MOUs.
The Board may approve one or more memoranda of understanding to clarify the financial and operational agreements between the district and the charter school. Any such memorandum of understanding shall be annually reviewed by the Board and charter school governing body and amended as necessary.

The Board may initially grant a charter for a specified term not to exceed five years.  (Education Code 47607)

When a petition is approved by the Board, it shall be the responsibility of the petitioners to provide written notice of the Board's approval and a copy of the petition to the County Superintendent of Schools, CDE, and the State Board of Education (SBE).  (Education Code 47605)

Denial of Petition

The Board shall summarily deny any charter petition that proposes to:

	Operate a charter school as or by a for-profit corporation, a for-profit educational management organization, or a for-profit charter management organization  (Education Code 47604)
	 
	Convert a private school to a charter school  (Education Code 47602)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47605, the Board may approve a charter school serving students in a grade level not offered by the district only when the charter school will also serve all the grade levels offered by the district. Thus, an elementary district's board cannot approve a charter for a high school, but may approve a charter for a K-12 school since the charter school will serve all grade levels served by the elementary school district.
	Serve students in a grade level that is not served by the district, unless the petition proposes to serve students in all the grade levels served by the district  (Education Code 47605)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47612.7, until January 1, 2025, the Board is prohibited from approving a petition for the establishment of a new charter school offering nonclassroom-based instruction. A charter school approved before October 1, 2019 which had started providing educational services as of that date may continue to offer nonclassroom-based instruction under the circumstances specified in Education Code 47612.7.
	Offer nonclassroom-based instruction  (Education Code 47612.7)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47605, a charter petition can be denied only if certain factual findings are made. 5 CCR 11967.5.1 contains criteria for SBE's review of charter petitions, which may be useful to the district in determining how it might evaluate whether a petition meets the conditions specified below.
Regarding all other charter petitions, the Board shall deny a petition only if the Board makes written factual findings specific to the petition that one or more of the following conditions exist:  (Education Code 47605; 5 CCR 11967.5.1)

	The charter school presents an unsound educational program that has a likelihood of physical, educational, or psychological harm to, or which is not likely to provide an educational benefit for, the students to be enrolled in the charter school.
	 
	The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.
	 
	The petition does not contain the number of signatures required.
	 
	The petition does not contain a clear, unequivocal statement described in Education Code 47605(e), including that the charter school will be nonsectarian and that the school shall not charge tuition or discriminate against any student based on the characteristics specified in Education Code 220.
	 
	The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the charter provisions in Education Code 47605(c).
	 
	The petition does not contain a declaration as to whether the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public employer of the school's employees for purposes of collective bargaining pursuant to Government Code 3540-3549.3.
	 
	The charter school is demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in which the school is proposing to locate. Analysis of this finding shall include consideration of the fiscal impact of the proposed charter school. A written factual finding shall detail specific facts and circumstances that analyze and consider the following factors:
	 
	
		The extent to which the proposed charter school would substantially undermine existing services, academic offerings, or programmatic offerings
		 
		Whether the proposed charter school would duplicate a program currently offered within the district, when the existing program has sufficient capacity for the students proposed to be served within reasonable proximity to where the charter school intends to locate
		
		CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47605, a district under state receivership is not in a position to absorb the fiscal impact of a proposed charter school.
	
	
	The district is not positioned to absorb the fiscal impact of the proposed charter school. The district meets this criterion if it has a negative interim certification, has a qualified interim certification and the County Superintendent certifies that approving the charter school would result in the district having a negative interim certification, or is under state receivership.

The Board shall not deny a petition based on the actual or potential costs of serving students with disabilities, nor shall it deny a petition solely because the charter school might enroll students with disabilities who reside outside the special education local plan area in which the district participates.  (Education Code 47605.7, 47647)

Appeals

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 47605, if the Board denies a charter petition, the petitioner may, within 30 days of the denial, submit the petition to the County Board. If the County Board denies a petition on appeal, the petitioner may, within 30 days of the denial by the County Board, appeal to SBE.
If the Board denies a petition, the petitioner may choose to submit the petition to the County Board of Education and, if then denied by the County Board, to SBE.  (Education Code 47605)

At the request of the petitioner, the Board shall prepare the documentary record, including a transcript of the public hearing at which the Board denied the charter, no later than 10 business days after the petitioner makes the request.  (Education Code 47605)

CSBA NOTE: CSBA's Education Legal Alliance and the Napa Valley Unified School District each have litigation pending against SBE and the exercise of its authority to reverse the denial of a charter school petition deciding that a board abused its discretion in denying the petition. Due to the legal uncertainty in this area, the Board should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel when a petition the Board has denied is on appeal to SBE.
Within 30 days of receipt of an appeal submitted to SBE, the Board may submit a written opposition to SBE, which may include supporting documentation, detailing, with specific citations to the documentary record, how the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition.  (Education Code 47605)

If either the County Board or SBE remands the petition to the Board because the petition on appeal contains new or different material terms, the Board shall reconsider the petition and shall grant or deny the petition within 30 days.  (Education Code 47605)
