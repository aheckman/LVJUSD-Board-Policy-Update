## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation applies to classified employees, including classified management. For certificated employees, including certificated management, see AR 4161.1/4361.1 - Personal Illness/Injury Leave.The following administrative regulation is subject to collective bargaining and should be revised in accordance with any applicable collective bargaining agreement. To the extent that this administrative regulation is inconsistent with provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement would prevail, so long as the provision is consistent with law. Certain portions of this administrative regulation are mandated or conditionally mandated; see "Verification Requirements" and "Continued Absence After Available Sick Leave Is Exhausted/Differential Pay" sections below.Education Code 45191 provides a minimum of 12 days of personal illness or injury leave (sick leave) per year for classified employees working five days a week, in both merit and non-merit system districts. The Governing Board may allow more sick leave at its discretion; if it does so, the following paragraph should be revised accordingly. Employees who work less than a full fiscal year, or fewer than five days a week, are entitled to the number of days of sick leave proportionate to the time they work, and to any additional sick leave that may be approved by the Board in the same proportion.Labor Code 245-249 (the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act) require districts to grant a minimum of one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked to their employees who work for 30 days within a year of employment, including classified employees. Pursuant to Labor Code 246, a district may use a different sick leave accrual method which provides for the accrual to be on a regular basis so that employees accrue at least 24 hours of sick leave or paid time off by the 120th calendar day of employment or each calendar year or 12-month period, and, as amended by SB 616 (Ch. 309, Statutes of 2023), at least 40 hours or five days of accrued sick leave or paid time off by the 200th calendar day of employment, each calendar year, or 12-month period.The provisions of Labor Code 245-249 are very broad and only district employees covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement may be exempted from them, if the collective bargaining agreement expressly provides paid sick leave in an amount equal to or exceeding the amount of leave required pursuant to Labor Code 246, includes final and binding arbitration of disputes regarding the application of the paid sick days provisions, and provides premium wage rates for all overtime hours worked and a regular hourly rate of pay of not less than 30 percent more than the state minimum wage rate. However, even for employees covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement, Labor Code 246.5, as amended by SB 616, extends procedural protections regarding retaliation to such employees. Since many districts may not satisfy all of the conditions for this exemption, this administrative regulation reflects the requirements of Labor Code 245-249. Any district which has a collective bargaining agreement that meets all of the conditions for exemption may modify this administrative regulation accordingly.For additional requirements of Labor Code 245-249, see sections titled "Short-Term and Substitute Employees" and "Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act Requirements" below. For sick leave for certificated employees, see AR 4161.1/4361.1 - Personal Illness/Injury Leave.
The following administrative regulation applies to classified employees, including classified management. For certificated employees, including certificated management, see Administrative Regulation 4161.1/4361.1 - Personal Illness/Injury Leave.

Classified employees employed five days a week are entitled to 12 days leave of absence with full pay for personal illness or injury (sick leave) per fiscal year. Employees who work less than a full fiscal year or fewer than five days a week (part-time employees) shall be granted sick leave in proportion to the time they work. However, part-time employees who are entitled to less than 24 hours of paid sick leave per fiscal year due to the amount of time worked shall be granted sick leave pursuant to Labor Code 246, if they are eligible.  (Education Code 45191; Labor Code 245-249)

Use of Sick Leave

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-8 below reflect allowable uses of sick leave specified in law. The district may expand this list to include any additional purposes authorized by law, authorized by the district, or included in a bargaining agreement.
A classified employee may use sick leave for absences as authorized by law and/or collective bargaining agreement, including, but not limited to:

	Accident or illness, whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of employment, or by quarantine which results from contact in the course of employment with other persons having a contagious disease  (Education Code 45199)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 12945.6, as added by SB 848 (Ch. 724, Statutes of 2023), the district is prohibited from refusing to grant a request by an employee to take up to five days of reproductive loss leave following a reproductive loss event; see AR 4161.2/4261.2/4361.2 - Personal Leaves.Additionally, pursuant to Title IX (20 USC 1681-1688) and implementing regulation 34 CFR 106.57, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, the district is required to treat pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation, including any related medical condition or recovery, as it would any other temporary medical condition for job-related purposes, including leaves.
	Pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and related recovery, as well as reproductive loss  (Education Code 45193; Government Code 12945.6)
	 
	Personal necessity  (Education Code 45207)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Optional Item #4 below may be revised to specify a different minimum increment.
	Medical and dental appointments, in increments of not less than one hour
	 
	Industrial accident or illness when leave granted specifically for that purpose has been exhausted  (Education Code 45192)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) (29 USC 2612) and California Family Rights Act (CFRA) (Government Code 12945.2), a district is required to grant leave to an eligible employee to bond with a child after the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of the child. For this purpose, employees may, but are not required to, use sick leave for any otherwise unpaid FMLA or CFRA leave.Government Code 12945.21, as amended by AB 1756 (Ch. 478, Statutes of 2023), establishes a small employer family leave mediation pilot program, until January 1, 2025, for very small districts that employ between 5-19 employees to mediate disputes about the employee's right to medical or family care leave under CFRA and/or bereavement leave.For further information regarding parental leave, see AR 4161.8/4261.8/4361.8 - Family Care and Medical Leave.
	Need of an employee to bond with a child within one year of the child's birth, adoption, or foster care placement (parental leave)  (Education Code 45196.1; Government Code 12945.2; 29 USC 2612; 29 CFR 825.112)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Labor Code 233, any district that provides sick leave to its employees is required to permit an employee to use sick leave, in an amount not less than the sick leave that would be accrued during six months at the employee's then current rate of entitlement, for the purposes specified in Items #7-8 below. Pursuant to Labor Code 233, designation of sick leave taken under this provision is at the sole discretion of the employee. Labor Code 233 does not extend the maximum period of leave to which an employee is entitled under CFRA or FMLA, regardless of whether the employee receives sick leave compensation during that leave.For the purpose of using sick leave to attend to the health care needs of a family member, as specified in Item #7 below, Labor Code 245.5 includes a designated person in the definition of a "family member," in addition to an employee's spouse, registered domestic partner, child (biological, adopted, or foster child; stepchild; legal ward; or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis), parent (biological, adoptive, or foster parent; stepparent; legal guardian of an employee or the employee's spouse or registered domestic partner; or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child), grandparent, grandchild, or sibling. Government Code 12945.2 defines a "designated person" as any individual related by blood or whose association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. The designated person may be identified by the employee at the time the employee requests the leave, and the district may limit the employee to one designated person per 12-month period for family care and medical leave. For further information regarding medical leave, see AR 4161.8/4261.8/4361.8 - Family Care and Medical Leave.For additional information about leaves for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking granted in accordance with Item #8 below, see AR 4161.2/4261.2/4361.2 - Personal Leaves.
	Need of the employee or the employee's family member, including a designated person, as defined in Labor Code 245.5, for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition or for preventive care  (Government Code 12945.2; Labor Code 233, 246.5)
	 
	Need of the employee to seek or obtain any relief or medical attention specified in Labor Code 230(c) and 230.1(a) for the health, safety, or welfare of the employee or the employee's child, when the employee has been a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking  (Labor Code 233, 246.5)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 12945.7, districts are required to provide up to five days of bereavement leave for the death of an employee's "family member," as defined, if the employee was employed by the district for at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the bereavement leave. The bereavement leave days do not need to be taken consecutively, but must be taken within three months of the family member's date of death. Districts with existing policies that provide employees less than five days of paid bereavement leave must continue to give employees the number of paid days specified in the policy, but may provide the remainder of the five days as unpaid bereavement leave. Districts must allow employees to use any paid vacation, personal leave, sick leave, or compensatory time off for the balance of the unpaid bereavement leave. For more information on bereavement leave, see AR 4161.2/4261.2/4361.2 - Personal Leaves. Districts with questions about the application of their bereavement leave policies should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
	Bereavement leave, as specified in Administrative Regulation 4161.2/4261.2/4361.2 - Personal Leaves  (Education Code 45194; Government Code 12945.7)

For the purposes specified in Items #7-8, an employee may use, in any calendar year, the amount of sick leave that would be accrued during six months at the employee's then current rate of entitlement.  (Labor Code 233)

An employee may take leave for personal illness or injury at any time during the year, even if credit for such leave has not yet been accrued. However, a new full-time classified employee shall not be entitled to more than six days of sick leave, or the proportionate amount to which the employee may be entitled, until the first day of the month after the employee has completed six months of active service with the district.  (Education Code 45191)

Unused days of sick leave shall be accumulated from year to year without limitation.  (Education Code 45191)

CSBA NOTE: The following two paragraphs are recommended and may be revised to reflect district practice. For more information regarding wage overpayment, see BP 4151/4251/4351 - Employee Compensation.
An employee shall reimburse the district for any unearned sick leave used as of the date of termination, in accordance with Education Code 44042.5.

At the beginning of each school year, employees shall be notified of the amount of sick leave they have accumulated.

The district shall not require newly employed classified employees to waive leave accumulated in a previous district. However, if the employee's previous employment was terminated for cause, the transfer of the accumulated leave shall be made only if approved by the Governing Board.  (Education Code 45202)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45202, classified employees who are terminated after at least one year of employment for any reason unrelated to discipline are entitled to have their accumulated sick leave transferred with them in certain circumstances. The following paragraph, which provides for the notification of employees as a way to implement this provision, is optional and may revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify any classified employee whose employment with the district is terminated after at least one calendar year for reasons other than for cause that, if the employee accepts employment in another district, county office of education, or community college district within one year of the termination of employment, the employee may request that the district transfer any accumulated sick leave to the new employer.  (Education Code 45202)

Additional Leave for Disabled Military Veterans

In addition to any other entitlement for sick leave with pay, a classified employee who is a former active duty member of the U.S. Armed Forces or a former or current member of the California National Guard or a federal reserve component shall be entitled to sick leave with pay of up to 12 days for the purpose of undergoing medical treatment, including mental health treatment, for a military service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or higher by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. An eligible employee who works less than five days per week shall be entitled to such leave in proportion to the time worked.  (Education Code 45191.5)

The amount of leave shall be credited to the employee either on the date the employee receives confirmation of the submission of the disability application to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or on the first day the employee begins or returns to employment after active duty, whichever is later. When the employee receives the disability rating decision, the employee shall report that information to the Superintendent or designee. If the disability rating decision makes the employee eligible for the leave, the time used before the decision shall be counted toward the 12-day maximum leave. If the disability rating decision makes the employee ineligible for the leave, the district may change the sick leave time used before the disability rating decision to an alternative leave balance.  (Education Code 45191.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45191.5, the district may require proof that a leave granted under this law is used for treatment of a military service-connected disability. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee may require verification, in accordance with the section "Verification Requirements" below, that the employee used the leave to obtain treatment of a military service-connected disability.

Leave for military-service connected disability shall be available for 12 months following the first date that the leave was credited. Leave not used during the 12-month period shall not be carried over and shall be forfeited.  (Education Code 45191.5)

Notification of Absence

CSBA NOTE: The following section is recommended and may be revised to reflect district practice.
An employee shall notify the Superintendent or the designated manager or supervisor of the need to be absent as soon as such need is known so that the services of a substitute may be secured as necessary. This notification shall include an estimate of the expected duration of absence. If the absence becomes longer than estimated, the employee shall so notify the district. If the duration of absence becomes shorter than estimated, the employee shall notify the district not later than three o'clock in the afternoon of the day preceding the day on which the employee intends to return to work. If the employee fails to notify the district and the failure results in a substitute being secured, the cost of the substitute shall be deducted from the employee's pay.

Continued Absence After Available Sick Leave Is Exhausted/Differential Pay

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45196, districts may choose one of two methods for compensating classified employees who have exhausted their paid leaves and continue to be absent due to illness or injury.Option 1 below is for use by districts that subtract the actual cost of a substitute from the absent employee's salary for up to five months. Pursuant to Education Code 45196, the amount paid to a substitute must be less than the absent employee's salary unless the Board has adopted a salary schedule for substitutes. In California School Employees Association v. Tustin Unified School District, the court ruled that a district could deduct from the absent employee's salary only the cost of an outside substitute employee, not the cost of existing classified employee(s) working additional hours to fill the position during the absence.Option 2 is mandated pursuant to Education Code 45196 for districts that annually credit regular classified employees with at least 100 working days of paid sick leave and, after they have exhausted all fully paid leaves, compensate them at 50 percent or more of their regular salary for the remainder of the 100 working days. Option 2 may be revised to specify more than 100 working days and/or the level of compensation the district will pay an employee, if it chooses to pay more than 50 percent of the employee's salary.Districts that maintain a catastrophic leave program for their classified employees should specify how the program will affect the differential leave pay to which the employee may be entitled.
OPTION 1:  (Differential pay: employee's salary minus actual cost of substitute)

When a classified employee has exhausted all paid leaves, including sick leave, and continues to be absent on account of illness or injury for a period of five months or less, the district shall deduct from the employee's regular salary for that period an amount that does not exceed the actual cost of a substitute to fill the position.  (Education Code 45196)

The five-month period shall commence on the first day of absence and shall run concurrently with any other paid leave.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Annual credit of 100 working days of paid sick leave; once fully paid leaves exhausted, 50 percent or more of regular salary for remainder of the 100 days)

Each year, each regular classified employee shall be credited with no fewer than 100 working days of paid leave for personal illness or injury, including current year and accumulated days of leave. When the current year and accumulated days at full pay are exhausted, the remainder of the 100 days shall be compensated at least 50 percent of the employee's regular salary. Any of the 100 days of leave not used during the year in which they are credited shall be forfeited and shall not accumulate from year to year. This paid leave shall be exclusive of any other paid leave, holidays, vacation, or compensatory time to which the employee may be entitled.  (Education Code 45196)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

Parental Leave

CSBA NOTE: The following section is subject to any conflicting provision in a collective bargaining agreement that provides greater parental leave rights.
During each school year, a classified employee may use all available sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, for the purpose of parental leave for a period of up to 12 work weeks. The 12-week period shall be reduced by any period of sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, taken during a period of such parental leave.  (Education Code 45196.1)

CSBA NOTE: Unlike leave taken pursuant to Government Code 12945.2, leave taken pursuant to Education Code 45196.1 does not require an employee to have at least 1,250 hours of service with the district during the previous 12-month period in order to be eligible for parental leave. See AR 4161.8/4261.8/4361.8 - Family Care and Medical Leave for further information on requirements related to the California Family Rights Act.
Eligibility for such leave shall not require 1,250 hours of service with the district during the previous 12 months.  (Education Code 45196.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45196.1, the district is required to provide differential pay to a classified employee for up to 12 work weeks when the employee has exhausted all available sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent due to parental leave pursuant to Government Code 12945.2. Such an employee is entitled to receive differential pay, calculated in the same manner described in Option 1 or 2 in the section "Continued Absence After Available Sick Leave Is Exhausted/Differential Pay" above. Education Code 45196.1 requires that, regardless of the type of differential pay system used by the district, employees must receive at least 50 percent of their regular salary for any portion of the 12-week parental leave that remains following the exhaustion of sick leave. The following paragraph may be revised to specify a percentage higher than 50 percent in accordance with district practice.Since Education Code 45196.1 does not expressly require districts to provide differential pay to employees who are eligible for parental leave pursuant to Government Code 12945.6, it is unclear whether such employees would be entitled to differential pay. Districts should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel if they have questions regarding differential pay for such employees.
An employee who has exhausted all available sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent on account of parental leave shall receive differential pay of at least 50 percent of the employee's regular salary for the remainder of the 12 work weeks.  (Education Code 45196.1)

Parental leave taken pursuant to Education Code 45196.1 shall run concurrently with the parental leave taken pursuant to Government Code 12945.2 or 12945.6, and the aggregate amount of parental leave shall not exceed 12 work weeks in a 12-month period.  (Education Code 45196.1; Government Code 12945.2, 12945.6)

Extension of Leave

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45195, the following extension of leave may be either paid or unpaid, and the Board may grant full pay for the full 18 months' allowable absence, if desired.
A permanent employee who is absent because of a personal illness or injury and who has exhausted all available sick leave, vacation, compensatory overtime, and any other paid leave shall be so notified, in writing, and offered an opportunity to request additional leave. The Board may grant the employee additional leave, paid or unpaid, for a period not to exceed six months and may renew this leave for two additional six-month periods or for lesser periods. The total additional leave granted shall not exceed 18 months.  (Education Code 45195)

If the employee is still unable to return to work after all available paid and unpaid leaves have been exhausted, the employee shall be placed on a reemployment list for a period of 39 months. If during this time the employee becomes medically able, the employee shall be offered reemployment in the first vacancy in the classification of the employee's previous assignment. During the 39 months, the employee's reemployment shall take preference over all other applicants except those laid off for lack of work or lack of funds, in which case the employee shall be ranked according to seniority.  (Education Code 45195)

Verification Requirements

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 45191 mandates the Board to adopt regulations that require proof of illness or injury and prescribe the means of verification. However, Education Code 45191 provides that these regulations shall not discriminate against evidence of treatment and the need for treatment by the practice of a well-recognized religion. The following section should be modified to reflect district practice and any procedures that have been specified in bargaining agreements.Labor Code 233 requires districts to allow their employees to use sick leave for the purposes specified in Labor Code 246.5. Because Labor Code 246.5 is silent on requests for verification, and requires an employer to provide an employee with paid sick days upon oral or written request, districts should be cautious in requiring verification for sick leave used for the purposes specified in Labor Code 246.5 (Items #7-8 in the section "Use of Sick Leave" above). Although a district is permitted to require verification from an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, pursuant to Labor Code 230 and 230.1, a general insistence on verification could be deemed a violation of Labor Code 246.5. Any district with questions regarding its authority related to verification should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
After any absence due to illness or injury, the employee shall submit a completed and signed district absence form to the employee's immediate supervisor.

The Superintendent or designee may require verification whenever an employee's absence record shows chronic absenteeism or a pattern of absences immediately before or after weekends and/or holidays or whenever available evidence clearly indicates that an absence is not related to illness or injury.

In addition, the Superintendent or designee may require an employee to visit a physician selected by the district, at district expense, in order to receive a report on the medical condition of the employee. The report shall include a statement as to the employee's need for additional leave of absence and a prognosis as to when the employee will be able to return to work. If the report concludes that the employee's condition does not warrant continued absence, the Superintendent or designee may, after giving notice to the employee, deny the request for additional leave.

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 2000ff-1, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, and its implementing regulations, 29 CFR 1635.1-1635.12, specify that it is unlawful for a district to request, require, or purchase an employee's or family member's individual genetic information except in complying with the medical certification requirements for family care and medical leave purposes or with the employee's prior written authorization. See AR 4161.8/4261.8/4361.8 - Family Care and Medical Leave. Pursuant to 29 CFR 1635.9, any such information received by the district must be kept confidential as specified below.
Any district request for additional verification by an employee's physician or a district-selected physician shall be in writing and shall specify that the report to be submitted to the district should not contain the employee's genetic information. Any genetic information received by the district on behalf of an employee shall be treated as a confidential medical record, maintained in a file separate from the employee's personnel file, and shall not be disclosed except in accordance with 29 CFR 1635.9.

Before returning to work, an employee who has been absent for surgery, hospitalization, or extended medical treatment may be asked to submit a letter from a physician stating that the employee is able to return to work and stipulating any necessary restrictions or limitations.

Short-Term and Substitute Employees

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Labor Code 245-249, the district is required to grant a minimum of one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked by an employee who works for 30 days within a year of employment. In implementing this requirement, Labor Code 246, as amended by SB 616, permits the district to use any of the options specified below. Option 1 provides for paid leave accrual based on one hour for every 30 hours worked. Option 2 allows an accrual method that provides for a regular accrual basis and ensures that the employee receives 24 hours of paid sick leave by the 120th calendar day of employment or each calendar year or 12-month period, and at least 40 hours of paid sick leave by the 200th calendar day of employment, each calendar year, or 12-month period. Option 3 is for any district that credits employees with 40 hours or five days of paid sick leave at the beginning of each year and does not allow unused sick leave to carry over to the next year. In addition, pursuant to Labor Code 245.5, retired annuitants who have not reinstated to the applicable public retirement system are excluded from participation in these leave benefit provisions.If a district implements Option 1 or Option 2, Labor Code 246 allows, but does not require, the district to limit employees' use of accrued paid sick days to 40 hours or five days each year of employment, calendar year, or 12-month period. The district should select the option below which corresponds to its approach under Labor Code 246.See section below titled "Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act Requirements" for additional requirements.
OPTION 1:  (Paid leave accrual based on one hour for every 30 hours worked)

Except for a retired annuitant who is not reinstated to the retirement system, short-term or substitute employees who work for 30 or more days within a year of their employment shall be entitled to one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Accrued paid sick days shall carry over to the following year of employment, up to a maximum of 80 hours or ten days. However, the district may limit an employee's use of accrued paid sick days to 40 hours or five days in each year of employment.  (Labor Code 246)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  (Paid leave accrual method that provides for a regular accrual basis)

Except for a retired annuitant who is not reinstated to the retirement system, short-term or substitute employees who work for 30 or more days within a year of their employment shall accrue, on a regular basis, paid sick leave of up to 24 hours by the 120th calendar day of their employment or each calendar year or 12-month period, and at least 40 hours or five days of paid sick leave by the 200th calendar day of employment, each calendar year, or 12-month period. Accrued paid sick days shall carry over to the following year of employment, up to a maximum of 80 hours or ten days. However, the district may limit an employee's use of accrued paid sick days to 40 hours or five days in each year of employment.  (Labor Code 246)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

OPTION 3:  (Paid leave that credits employees with sick leave at the beginning of each year and does not allow unused sick leave to carry over to the next year)

Except for a retired annuitant who is not reinstated to the retirement system, short-term or substitute employees who work for 30 or more days within a year of their employment shall be credited with 40 hours or five days of paid sick leave for that year. Unused sick leave shall not carry over to the following year of employment.  (Labor Code 246)

OPTION 3 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph applies to all the above options.
Short-term or substitute employees may begin to use accrued paid sick days on the 90th day of their employment, after which they may use the sick days as they are accrued.  (Labor Code 246)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph applies to all of the above options and reflects the intent of the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act to enable California workers to address their own and their family's health needs and to provide them with economic security when they need to take time off work for reasons of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The following paragraph may be revised to include additional reasons for which short-term or substitute employees may use sick leave, pursuant to district policy or practice. Pursuant to Labor Code 247.5, a district is not required to inquire into the purposes for which an employee uses paid leave.
A short-term or substitute employee may use accrued sick leave for absences due to:  (Labor Code 246.5)

	The employee's own need or the need of a family member, as defined in Labor Code 245.5, for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition or for preventive care
	 
	Need of the employee to obtain or seek any relief or medical attention specified in Labor Code 230(c) and 230.1(a) for the health, safety, or welfare of the employee, or the employee's child, when the employee has been a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking

Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act Requirements

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Labor Code 245-249, all employers, including those that provide paid time off to their employees under existing policy or other law, must comply with the requirements specified in the following section. Pursuant to Labor Code 248.5, noncompliance with the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act could result in an enforcement action against the employer, including the imposition of civil and monetary penalties. Any district with questions regarding the applicability of this law should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
No employee, including a short-term or substitute employee, shall be denied the right to use accrued sick days and the district shall not in any manner discriminate or retaliate against an employee for using or attempting to use sick leave, filing a complaint with the Labor Commissioner, or alleging district violation of Labor Code 245-249.

To ensure the district's compliance with Labor Code 245-249, the Superintendent or designee shall:

	At a conspicuous location in each workplace, display a poster on paid sick leave that includes the following information:
	 
	
		That an employee is entitled to accrue, request, and use paid sick days
		 
		The number of sick days provided by Labor Code 245-249

<body aria-readonly="false" data-gramm_editor="false" data-wsc-instance="true"><div id='wMA895' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation applies to classified employees, including classified management. For certificated employees, including certificated management, see AR 4161.1/4361.1 - Personal Illness/Injury Leave.<br><br>The following administrative regulation is subject to collective bargaining and should be revised in accordance with any applicable collective bargaining agreement. To the extent that this administrative regulation is inconsistent with provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement would prevail, so long as the provision is consistent with law. Certain portions of this administrative regulation are mandated or conditionally mandated; see "Verification Requirements" and "Continued Absence After Available Sick Leave Is Exhausted/Differential Pay" sections below.<br><br>Education Code 45191 provides a minimum of 12 days of personal illness or injury leave (sick leave) per year for classified employees working five days a week, in both merit and non-merit system districts. The Governing Board may allow more sick leave at its discretion; if it does so, the following paragraph should be revised accordingly. Employees who work less than a full fiscal year, or fewer than five days a week, are entitled to the number of days of sick leave proportionate to the time they work, and to any additional sick leave that may be approved by the Board in the same proportion.<br><br>Labor Code 245-249 (the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act) require districts to grant a minimum of one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked to their employees who work for 30 days within a year of employment, including classified employees. Pursuant to Labor Code 246, a district may use a different sick leave accrual method which provides for the accrual to be on a regular basis so that employees accrue at least 24 hours of sick leave or paid time off by the 120th calendar day of employment or each calendar year or 12-month period, and, as amended by SB 616 (Ch. 309, Statutes of 2023), at least 40 hours or five days of accrued sick leave or paid time off by the 200th calendar day of employment, each calendar year, or 12-month period.<br><br>The provisions of Labor Code 245-249 are very broad and only district employees covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement may be exempted from them, if the collective bargaining agreement expressly provides paid sick leave in an amount equal to or exceeding the amount of leave required pursuant to Labor Code 246, includes final and binding arbitration of disputes regarding the application of the paid sick days provisions, and provides premium wage rates for all overtime hours worked and a regular hourly rate of pay of not less than 30 percent more than the state minimum wage rate. However, even for employees covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement, Labor Code 246.5, as amended by SB 616, extends procedural protections regarding retaliation to such employees. Since many districts may not satisfy all of the conditions for this exemption, this administrative regulation reflects the requirements of Labor Code 245-249. Any district which has a collective bargaining agreement that meets all of the conditions for exemption may modify this administrative regulation accordingly.<br><br>For additional requirements of Labor Code 245-249, see sections titled "Short-Term and Substitute Employees" and "Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act Requirements" below. For sick leave for certificated employees, see AR 4161.1/4361.1 - Personal Illness/Injury Leave.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MjIwMg0"

Government Code 12945.2 defines a "designated person" as any individual related by blood or whose association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. The designated person may be identified by the employee at the time the employee requests the leave, and the district may limit the employee to one designated person per 12-month period for family care and medical leave.

	<div id='xNg901' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 12945.7, districts are required to provide up to five days of bereavement leave for the death of an employee's "family member," as defined, if the employee was employed by the district for at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the bereavement leave. The bereavement leave days do not need to be taken consecutively, but must be taken within three months of the family member's date of death. Districts with existing policies that provide employees less than five days of paid bereavement leave must continue to give employees the number of paid days specified in the policy, but may provide the remainder of the five days as unpaid bereavement leave. Districts must allow employees to use any paid vacation, personal leave, sick leave, or compensatory time off for the balance of the unpaid bereavement leave. For more information on bereavement leave, see AR 4161.2/4261.2/4361.2 - Personal Leaves.

<strong>Continued Absence After Available Sick Leave Is Exhausted/Differential Pay</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='cNQ906' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 45196, districts may choose one of two methods for compensating classified employees who have exhausted their paid leaves and continue to be absent due to illness or injury.<br><br>Option 1 below is for use by districts that subtract the actual cost of a substitute from the absent employee's salary for up to five months. Pursuant to Education Code 45196, the amount paid to a substitute must be less than the absent employee's salary unless the Board has adopted a salary schedule for substitutes.

<strong>Verification Requirements</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='YMA911' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Education Code 45191 mandates the Board to adopt regulations that require proof of illness or injury and prescribe the means of verification. However, Education Code 45191 provides that these regulations shall not discriminate against evidence of treatment and the need for treatment by the practice of a well-recognized religion. The following section should be modified to reflect district practice and any procedures that have been specified in bargaining agreements.<br><br>Labor Code 233 requires districts to allow their employees to use sick leave for the purposes specified in Labor Code 246.5. Because Labor Code 246.5 is silent on requests for verification, and requires an employer to provide an employee with paid sick days upon oral or written request, districts should be cautious in requiring verification for sick leave used for the purposes specified in Labor Code 246.5 (Items #7-8 in the section "Use of Sick Leave" above). Although a district is permitted to require verification from an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, pursuant to Labor Code 230 and 230.1, a general insistence on verification could be deemed a violation of Labor Code 246.5. Any district with questions regarding its authority related to verification should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MjIwMg16" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MjIwMg16%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22YMA911%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1719019370%2C%22text%22%3A%22Education%20Code%2045191%20mandates%20the%20Board%20to%20adopt%20regulations%20that%20require%20proof%20of%20illness%20or%20injury%20and%20prescribe%20the%20means%20of%20verification.%20However%2C%20Education%20Code%2045191%20provides%20that%20these%20regulations%20shall%20not%20discriminate%20against%20evidence%20of%20treatment%20and%20the%20need%20for%20treatment%20by%20the%20practice%20of%20a%20well-recognized%20religion.%20The%20following%20section%20should%20be%20modified%20to%20reflect%20district%20practice%20and%20any%20procedures%20that%20have%20been%20specified%20in%20bargaining%20agreements.%5Cn%5CnLabor%20Code%20233%20requires%20districts%20to%20allow%20their%20employees%20to%20use%20sick%20leave%20for%20the%20purposes%20specified%20in%20Labor%20Code%20246.5.%20Because%20Labor%20Code%20246.5%20is%20silent%20on%20requests%20for%20verification%2C%20and%20requires%20an%20employer%20to%20provide%20an%20employee%20with%20paid%20sick%20days%20upon%20oral%20or%20written%20request%2C%20districts%20should%20be%20cautious%20in%20requiring%20verification%20for%20sick%20leave%20used%20for%20the%20purposes%20specified%20in%20Labor%20Code%20246.5%20%28Items%20%237-8%20in%20the%20section%20%5C%22Use%20of%20Sick%20Leave%5C%22%20above%29.%20Although%20a%20district%20is%20permitted%20to%20require%20verification%20from%20an%20employee%20who%20is%20a%20victim%20of%20domestic%20violence%2C%20sexual%20assault%2C%20or%20stalking%2C%20pursuant%20to%20Labor%20Code%20230%20and%20230.1%2C%20a%20general%20insistence%20on%20verification%20could%20be%20deemed%20a%20violation%20of%20Labor%20Code%20246.5.%20Any%20district%20with%20questions%20regarding%20its%20authority%20related%20to%20verification%20should%20consult%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MjIwMg16" title="CSBA NOTE: Education Code 45191 mandates the Board..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

<div id='zNg913' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Labor Code 245-249, the district is required to grant a minimum of one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked by an employee who works for 30 days within a year of employment. In implementing this requirement, Labor Code 246, as amended by SB 616, permits the district to use any of the options specified below. Option 1 provides for paid leave accrual based on one hour for every 30 hours worked. Option 2 allows an accrual method that provides for a regular accrual basis and ensures that the employee receives 24 hours of paid sick leave by the 120th calendar day of employment or each calendar year or 12-month period, and at least 40 hours of paid sick leave by the 200th calendar day of employment, each calendar year, or 12-month period. Option 3 is for any district that credits employees with 40 hours or five days of paid sick leave at the beginning of each year and does not allow unused sick leave to carry over to the next year. In addition, pursuant to Labor Code 245.5, retired annuitants who have not reinstated to the applicable public retirement system are excluded from participation in these leave benefit provisions.<br><br>If a district implements Option 1 or Option 2, Labor Code 246 allows, but does not require, the district to limit employees' use of accrued paid sick days to 40 hours or five days each year of employment, calendar year, or 12-month period.
