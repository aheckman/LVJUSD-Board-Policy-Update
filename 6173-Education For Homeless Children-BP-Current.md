## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy reflects the intent of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 USC 11431-11435) that each student experiencing homelessness should have equal access to the same free, appropriate public education and services as other students. 42 USC 11432 mandates that districts adopt, review, and revise policies to remove barriers to the identification, enrollment, and retention of homeless children and youth, ensure that students experiencing homelessness are not segregated or stigmatized on the basis of their status as homeless, and provide for professional development for appropriate staff, as provided in the following policy and regulation. In addition, 42 USC 11432 requires that, in reviewing and revising applicable policies, consideration be given to issues concerning transportation, immunization, residency, birth certificates, school records and other documentation, and guardianship.Education Code 48851.3, as added by AB 408 (Ch. 904, Statutes of 2022), mandates that districts establish homeless education program policies that are consistent with the provisions of Education Code 48850-48859, and using resources developed by the California Department of Education (CDE), available on its web site, and those developed by homeless education technical assistance centers. Pursuant to Education Code 48851.3, as added by AB 408, districts are required to update their homeless education program policies at least once every three years.Education Code 48852.3, added by AB 408, requires CDE to develop and implement a plan for monitoring the compliance of districts, including school site inspections, to ensure that the state is not underestimating the number of youth experiencing homelessness.
The Governing Board believes that the identification of students experiencing homelessness is critical to improving the educational outcomes of such students and ensuring that students experiencing homelessness have access to the same free and appropriate public education provided to other students within the district. The district shall provide students experiencing homelessness with access to education and other services necessary for such students to meet the same challenging academic standards as other students.

When there are at least 15 students experiencing homelessness in the district or a district school, the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) shall include goals and specific actions to improve student achievement and other outcomes of students experiencing homelessness.  (Education Code 52052, 52060, 52064)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is mandated pursuant to Education Code 48851.3 and 42 USC 11432. 42 USC 11432 requires that districts adopt policy to remove barriers to enrollment and retention of students experiencing homelessness due to absences or outstanding fees or fines. See the accompanying administrative regulation for additional procedures designed to remove barriers to the identification and enrollment of students experiencing homelessness.
The Superintendent or designee shall review district policies at least once every three years and recommend updates to ensure removal of any barriers to the education of homeless students and unaccompanied youth.

The housing questionnaire must be based on best practices developed by CDE, include an explanation of the rights and protections a student has as a homeless child or youth or as an unaccompanied youth, and be made available in paper form. A sample housing questionnaire is available on CDE's web site.Education Code 48851, as amended by AB 2375, requires districts to collect the completed housing questionnaires described above, and annually report to CDE the number of students experiencing homelessness and unaccompanied youths enrolled in the district.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each district school identifies all students experiencing homelessness and unaccompanied youths enrolled at the school.  (Education Code 48851)

Each student experiencing homelessness shall be provided services that are comparable to services offered to other students in the school, including, but not limited to, transportation, educational programs for which the student meets the eligibility criteria (such as federal Title I services or similar state or local programs, programs for students with disabilities, and educational programs for English learners), career and technical education programs, programs for gifted and talented students, and school nutrition programs.  (Education Code 48850; 42 USC 11432)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is mandated by 42 USC 11432. Although segregation of students experiencing homelessness into a separate school or program is prohibited, separate schools that were in operation before 2001 may continue to operate under specified conditions. Districts that maintain such a school may revise the following paragraph to reflect district practice.
Students experiencing homelessness shall not be segregated into a separate school or program based on their status as homeless and shall not be stigmatized in any way. However, the Superintendent or designee may separate students experiencing homelessness on school grounds as necessary for short periods of time for health and safety emergencies or to provide temporary, special, and supplementary services to meet their unique needs.  (42 USC 11432, 11433)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that information and/or materials for students experiencing homelessness are provided in a manner and form understandable to the student's parents/guardians and to unaccompanied youths.

CSBA NOTE: Although students' addresses generally may be designated as "directory information" that is not harmful if disclosed, 42 USC 11432 provides that information about the living situation of a student experiencing homelessness must instead be provided the protections afforded to other student records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. For further information about the disclosure of records of students experiencing homelessness, see the U.S. Department of Education's (USDOE), "Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program Non-Regulatory Guidance."
Information about the living situation of a student experiencing homelessness shall be considered part of a student's educational record, subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, shall not be deemed to be directory information as defined in 20 USC 1232g, and shall not be released without written consent.  (42 USC 11432)

Toward these ends, the Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with local social services agencies, other agencies or entities providing services to students experiencing homelessness, and, if applicable, transitional housing facilities. In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall coordinate transportation, transfer of school records, and other interdistrict activities with other local educational agencies. As necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall coordinate, within the district and with other involved local educational agencies, services for students experiencing homelessness and services for students with disabilities.  (42 USC 11432)

CSBA NOTE: 42 USC 11432 mandates that districts adopt policies and practices to ensure participation by district liaisons and other appropriate staff in professional development and other technical assistance activities, as determined appropriate by the federal Office of the Coordinator.Education Code 48852.5 requires CDE to provide specified informational and training materials to district liaisons, including informational materials on the educational rights of students experiencing homelessness and resources available to assist students experiencing homelessness.
