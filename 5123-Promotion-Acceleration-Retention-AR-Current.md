## Policy Content

Acceleration from Kindergarten to First Grade

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48010, a student will be admitted to first grade if his/her sixth birthday is on or before September 1; see AR 5111 - Admission.
Any student who meets the age eligibility requirement and has completed one year of kindergarten shall be admitted to first grade unless the parent/guardian and the Superintendent or designee agree that the student shall continue in kindergarten.  (Education Code 48010, 48011)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48011, if a student does not meet the age eligibility requirement specified in Education Code 48010, he/she may be admitted to the first grade at the discretion of the administration of the district and with the consent of the student's parents/guardians. 5 CCR 200 mandates that the district adopt regulations setting forth procedures for early admission into first grade which ensure that students meet the minimum criteria outlined below. The district may specify additional criteria if desired.
A student who does not meet the age eligibility requirement may be admitted to first grade at the discretion of the Superintendent or designee and with the consent of the parent/guardian upon determination that the student is ready for first-grade work, subject to the following minimum criteria:  (Education Code 48011; 5 CCR 200)

	The student is at least five years of age.
	 
	The student has attended a public school kindergarten for a long enough time to enable school personnel to evaluate his/her ability.
	 
	The student is in the upper five percent of his/her age group in terms of general mental ability.
	 
	The physical development and social maturity of the student are consistent with his/her advanced mental ability.
	 
	The parent/guardian of the student has filed a written statement with the district approving the placement in first grade.

Continuation in Kindergarten

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 46300 specifies that when a student has completed one year of kindergarten, his/her further attendance in kindergarten may be included in the computation of average daily attendance only if the district has on file for the student a signed continuance form, available on the California Department of Education's (CDE) web site, stating that the student shall continue in kindergarten for not more than one additional school year. This agreement is required for any student who continues in kindergarten after one year, even if he/she was admitted early pursuant to Education Code 48000.
Whenever the Superintendent or designee and the parents/guardians agree that a student shall continue in kindergarten for an additional year, the Superintendent or designee shall secure an agreement, signed by the parent/guardian, stating that the student shall continue in kindergarten for not more than one additional school year.  (Education Code 46300, 48011)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is consistent with a recommendation on the CDE's kindergarten continuance form that the approval for a student's continuance not be given until near the anniversary of the student's admittance to kindergarten because children at this age often do not develop at steady or predictable rates. Permission obtained unreasonably far in advance could be found invalid.
The Superintendent or designee shall not approve a student's continuation in kindergarten until the student has been enrolled in kindergarten for close to one school year.

Retention at Other Grade Levels

CSBA NOTE: The following section applies to grades 1-12. For indicators established by the Governing Board for the identification of students for retention at their current grade level, see the accompanying Board policy.
If a student is identified as performing below the minimum standard for promotion to the next grade level based on the indicators specified in Board policy, the student shall be retained in his/her current grade level unless the student's regular classroom teacher determines, in writing, that retention is not the appropriate intervention for the student's academic deficiencies. This determination shall specify the reasons that retention is not appropriate for the student and shall include recommendations for interventions other than retention that, in the opinion of the teacher, are necessary to assist the student in attaining acceptable levels of academic achievement.  (Education Code 48070.5)

If the teacher's recommendation to promote is contingent on the student's participation in a summer school or interim session remediation program, the student's academic performance shall be reassessed at the end of the remediation program, and the decision to retain or promote the student shall be reevaluated at that time. The teacher's evaluation shall be provided to and discussed with the student's parents/guardians and the principal before any final determination of retention or promotion.  (Education Code 48070.5)

When a student is identified as being at risk of retention, the Superintendent or designee shall so notify the student's parent/guardian as early in the school year as practicable.  The student's parent/guardian shall be provided an opportunity to consult with the teacher(s) responsible for the decision to promote or retain the student.  (Education Code 48070.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional.
The Superintendent or designee shall also provide a copy of the district's promotion/retention policy and administrative regulation to those parents/guardians who have been notified that their child is at risk of retention.

Appeal Process

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48070.5 mandates that the district's policy include a process by which the teacher's decision to promote or retain a student may be appealed; also see the accompanying Board policy. The following section provides a sample appeal process and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Whenever a student's parent/guardian appeals the teacher's decision to promote or retain a student, the burden shall be on the parent/guardian to show why the teacher's decision should be overruled.  (Education Code 48070.5)

To appeal a teacher's decision, the parent/guardian shall submit a written request to the Superintendent or designee specifying the reasons that the teacher's decision should be overruled. The appeal must be initiated within 10 school days of the determination of retention or promotion.

The teacher shall be provided an opportunity to state orally and/or in writing the criteria on which his/her decision was based.

Within 30 days of receiving the request, the Superintendent or designee shall determine whether or not to overrule the teacher's decision.  Prior to making this determination, the Superintendent or designee may meet with the parent/guardian and the teacher.  If the Superintendent or designee determines that the parent/guardian has overwhelmingly proven that the teacher's decision should be overruled, he/she shall overrule the teacher's decision.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that choose to allow the Superintendent or designee's decision to be appealed to the Board. Districts that authorize the Superintendent or designee to make the final determination should delete the following paragraph.
The Superintendent or designee's determination may be appealed by submitting a written appeal to the Governing Board within 15 school days.  Within 30 days of receipt of a written appeal, the Board shall meet in closed session to decide the appeal.  The Board's decision may be made on the basis of documentation prepared as part of the appeal process or, at the discretion of the Board, the Board may also meet with the parent/guardian, the teacher, and the Superintendent or designee to decide the appeal.  The decision of the Board shall be final.

If the final decision is unfavorable to the parent/guardian, he/she shall have the right to submit a written statement of objections which shall become part of the student's record.
