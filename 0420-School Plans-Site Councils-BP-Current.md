## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board believes that comprehensive planning is necessary at each school in order to focus school improvement efforts on student academic achievement and facilitate the effective use of available resources. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that school plans provide clear direction and identify cohesive strategies aligned with school and district goals.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 64000, the district may submit a consolidated application to the California Department of Education (CDE) to apply for federal categorical funds and/or state categorical programs that are not funded through the local control funding formula. As a condition of receiving such funds, Education Code 64001, as amended by AB 716 (Ch. 471, Statutes of 2018), requires each school to consolidate all of the plans that are required by these programs into a school plan for student achievement (SPSA), unless otherwise prohibited by law. If these programs do not require a plan, the Governing Board may require a school that participates in any program included on the consolidated application to develop an SPSA.Pursuant to Education Code 64001, each school preparing an SPSA must have the SPSA developed and approved by a school site council. Education Code 65000-65001, as added by AB 716, contain requirements for the establishment and membership of school site councils; see the accompanying administrative regulation.For additional information regarding the development and content of the SPSA, see the accompanying administrative regulation and CDE's publication A Guide for Developing the Single Plan for Student Achievement: A Resource for the School Site Council, available on its web site. Education Code 64001 provides that, although SPSAs are not required to be submitted as part of the consolidated application, they will be reviewed by CDE during the Federal Program Monitoring process.Pursuant to Education Code 64001, districts with a single school may instead utilize the local control and accountability plan (LCAP) to serve as the SPSA if the LCAP meets certain federal planning and stakeholder requirements.
Each district school that participates in one or more federal and/or state categorical programs funded through the state's consolidated application process pursuant to Education Code 64000 shall establish a school site council in accordance with Education Code 65000-65001.  The school site council shall develop, approve, and annually review and update a school plan for student achievement (SPSA) which consolidates the plans required for those categorical programs into a single plan, unless otherwise prohibited by law.  (Education Code 64001)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 52062, there must be consistency between a school's SPSA and specific actions included in the district's LCAP. For more detailed requirements of the LCAP, see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.
The Superintendent or designee shall review each school's SPSA to ensure that it meets the content requirements for all applicable programs, is based on an analysis of current practices and student academic performance, and reasonably links improvement strategies to identified needs of the school and its students. The Superintendent or designee shall also ensure consistency between the specific actions included in the district's local control and accountability plan and the strategies identified in each school's SPSA.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 64001, as amended by AB 716, requires the Board to review and approve a school's SPSA whenever there are material revisions affecting the academic programs for students participating in the categorical programs. Although not explicitly required by law, it is recommended that the Board also review the initial plan.
The Board shall, at a regularly scheduled Board meeting, review and approve each school's SPSA whenever there are any material revisions affecting the academic programs for students participating in the categorical programs addressed in the SPSA.  (Education Code 64001)

If the Board does not approve a school's SPSA, it shall communicate its specific reasons for disapproval of the plan to the school site council. The school site council shall then revise and resubmit the SPSA to the Board for its approval.  (Education Code 64001)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that school administrators and school site council members receive training on the roles and responsibilities of the school site council.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 64001, as amended by AB 716, authorizes a school identified for targeted or comprehensive support pursuant to 20 USC 6303 to use its SPSA to satisfy the requirement for a school improvement plan.
The SPSA may serve as the school improvement plan required when a school is identified for targeted or comprehensive support pursuant to 20 USC 6303.  (Education Code 64001)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 64001, as amended by AB 716, provides that complaints alleging noncompliance with requirements pertaining to school site councils or the SPSA may be addressed through the district's uniform complaint procedures pursuant to 5 CCR 4600-4670.
Any complaint alleging noncompliance with requirements related to the establishment of school site councils or the development of the SPSA may be filed with the district in accordance with the district's uniform complaint procedures pursuant to 5 CCR 4600-4670 and BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.  (Education Code 64001)
