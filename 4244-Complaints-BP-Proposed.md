## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the need to establish a process to allow employees and job applicants to have their concerns heard in an expeditious and unbiased manner. The Board expects that employees will make every effort to resolve complaints and disagreements informally before filing a formal complaint.

The Board prohibits retaliation against complainants. The Superintendent or designee may keep a complainant's identity confidential, except to the extent necessary to investigate the complaint.

All matters related to a complaint shall be kept confidential and any document, communication, or record regarding the complaint shall be placed in a separate file and shall not be placed in an employee's personnel file.
