## Policy Content

Notices of Missing Children

Every school shall post in an appropriate area the monthly poster on missing children provided by the Department of Justice (DOJ). For elementary schools, the poster shall be posted in an area restricted to adults.  (Education Code 38139; Penal Code 14210)

Whenever a new student enrolls or transfers into an elementary school in the District, the principal or designee is encouraged to review the missing person bulletins provided by the DOJ to determine if the student resembles a child listed as missing. (Education Code 49068.5)

School staff are also encouraged to monitor "Amber Alerts" issued by law enforcement agencies in serious, time-critical child abduction cases.

If a law enforcement agency notifies the District that a child enrolled in the District has been reported missing, the principal or designee of the school in which the child is enrolled shall place a notice on the front of the child's school record indicating that he/she has been reported missing. If a school receives a record inquiry or request from any person or entity regarding a missing child about whom the school has been notified, the principal or designee shall immediately notify the law enforcement agency that informed the school of the missing child's status.  (Education Code 49068.6)

Reporting Missing Children

Any District employee who recognizes a child who has been reported missing through a DOJ notice, an Amber Alert, or other means shall immediately notify law enforcement using the hotline telephone number listed.

In the event that a District employee witnesses a child abduction, he/she shall immediately contact law enforcement and provide the agency with information on the location of the abduction and a description of the victim, the suspect, and any vehicle involved.  He/she shall also notify the Superintendent or designee who shall implement steps, as needed, to ensure the safety of other students.
