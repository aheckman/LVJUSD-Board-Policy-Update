## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51744-51749.6 authorize districts to establish independent study programs to meet the educational needs of students.Education Code 51747 and 51749.5 mandate the Governing Board to adopt a policy with specified components as a condition of receiving state apportionments for traditional and course-based independent study, and to implement the policy in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The mandated components for traditional independent study and course-based independent study are reflected throughout this policy and the accompanying administrative regulation.Education Code 51744 encourages districts, when adopting policy, to consider offering more than one independent study model for short- and long-term placements in accordance with Education Code 51747, 51747.5, and 51749.6.In the event of a school closure necessitated by an emergency condition specified in Education Code 46392, Education Code 46393, as amended by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024) and AB 176 (Ch. 998, Statutes of 2024), requires districts submitting affidavits regarding emergency events occurring after September 1, 2021, but before July 1, 2026, to certify that the district has a plan for offering independent study to impacted students within 10 instructional days. For events occurring on or after July 1, 2026, Education Code 46393, as amended by SB 153 and AB 176, requires districts to certify that the district's comprehensive safety plan includes an instructional continuity plan, and that the district offered student engagement and instruction consistent with the instructional continuity plan or certify that it did not do so due to extenuating circumstances.
The Governing Board authorizes independent study as an optional alternative instructional strategy for students whose needs may be best met through study outside of the regular classroom setting. Independent study shall offer a means of individualizing the educational plan to serve students who desire a more challenging educational experience, whose health or other personal circumstances make classroom attendance difficult, who are unable to access course(s) due to scheduling problems, and/or who need to make up credits or fill gaps in their learning. As necessary to meet student needs, independent study may be offered for short- or long-term placements, on a full-time or part-time basis, and/or in conjunction with part- or full-time classroom study.

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 11701 requires the Board to hold a public hearing when setting policy regarding the maximum length of time that may elapse between the time an independent study assignment is made and the date by which the student must complete it, and the level of satisfactory educational progress and the number of missed assignments that will be allowed before an evaluation is conducted to determine whether it is in the student's best interests to remain in independent study. See "General Independent Study Requirements" below for more information regarding these requirements.
The Board shall hold a public hearing when considering the scope of its existing or prospective use of independent study as an instructional strategy, its purposes in authorizing independent study, and factors bearing specifically on the maximum realistic lengths of assignments and acceptable number of missed assignments for specific populations of students or adult education students.  (Education Code 51747; 5 CCR 11701)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 58500-58512, independent study may be offered as a program within a school, as a charter school, or as an alternative school of choice; see AR 0420.4 - Charter School Authorization, BP 6146.11 - Alternative Credits Toward Graduation, and BP/AR 6181 - Alternative Schools/Programs of Choice.
The Superintendent or designee may provide a variety of independent study opportunities, including, but not limited to, through a program or class within a comprehensive school, a charter school, an alternative school or program of choice, and/or an online course.

Student participation in independent study shall be voluntary and no student shall be required to participate.  (Education Code 51747, 51749.5, 51749.6)

Independent study for each student shall be under the general supervision of a district employee who possesses a valid certification document pursuant to Education Code 44865 or an emergency credential pursuant to Education Code 44300. Students' independent study shall be coordinated, evaluated, and documented, as prescribed by law and reflected in the accompanying administrative regulation.  (Education Code 51747.5)

CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to Education Code 46300, as amended by SB 153, when computing average daily attendance for apportionment purposes, students participating in independent study may only be credited with one day of attendance for each calendar day.
An independent study student shall not be credited with more than one day of attendance per calendar day.  (Education Code 46300)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49501.5, as amended by SB 348 (Ch. 600, Statutes of 2023), a district is required to make available at no cost, a nutritionally adequate breakfast and lunch to any district student who requests a meal, including an independent study student who is scheduled for educational activities, as defined in Education Code 49010, lasting for two or more hours at a school site, resource center, meeting space, or other satellite facility, regardless of the student's eligibility for a free or reduced-price meal. For more information regarding school meals, see BP/AR 3550 - Food Service/Child Nutrition Program.
A nutritionally adequate breakfast and lunch shall be made available at no cost to any independent study student scheduled for educational activities lasting two or more hours at a school site, resource center, meeting space, or other satellite facility, who requests a meal.  (Education Code 49501.5)

General Independent Study Requirements

The Superintendent or designee may offer and approve independent study for an individual student upon determining that the student is prepared to meet the district's requirements for participation and is likely to succeed as well as or better than the student would in the regular classroom setting.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46100, the Board is required to fix the length of the school day for each grade level, in accordance with law. The California Department of Education, on its "Frequently Asked Questions"' and "Independent Study" webpages, clarifies that independent study is not an alternative curriculum and that students in independent study are required to meet the same number of instructional minutes as their peers who are physically at the school site for their instruction.
The minimum instructional minutes shall be the same for all students at each school including students participating in independent study, except as otherwise permitted by law.  (Education Code 46100)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747 mandates the Board to adopt policy on the maximum length of time, by grade level and type of program, which may elapse between the time an independent study assignment is made and the date by which the student must complete the assignment. 5 CCR 11700 defines "type of program" as the statutory program category for purposes of attendance accounting. In addition, 5 CCR 11701 mandates that Board policy reflect an awareness that excessive leniency in the duration of independent study assignments can result in a student falling so far behind peers as to increase, rather than decrease, the risk of dropping out of school.The following paragraph sets one week for all grade levels and types of programs as the maximum length of time an independent study assignment should be completed, and should be revised to reflect the length of time determined by the Board. In order to ensure that apportionment credits are received, the length of time determined by the Board in its policy should be reflected in the student's written agreement. See "Master Agreement" below.
Because excessive leniency in the duration of independent study assignments may result in a student falling behind peers and increase the risk of dropping out of school, independent study assignments shall be completed no more than one week after assigned for all grade levels and types of programs. When necessary, based on the specific circumstances of the student's approved program, the Superintendent or designee may allow for a longer period of time between the date an assignment is made and when it is due. However, in no event shall the due date of an assignment be extended beyond the termination date specified in the student's written agreement.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747 mandates the Board, to adopt policy which specifies the level of satisfactory educational progress and the number of missed assignments allowed before an evaluation is conducted to determine whether it is in a student's best interest to remain in independent study. The following paragraph specifies a maximum of three assignments and should be revised to reflect the Board's determination of the number of missed assignments that will give rise to an evaluation.The number of missed assignments that will give rise to an evaluation must be included in the student's written agreement.
An evaluation shall be conducted to determine whether it is in a student's best interest to remain in independent study whenever the student fails to make satisfactory educational progress and/or misses three assignments. Satisfactory educational progress shall be determined based on all of the following indicators:  (Education Code 51747)

	The student's achievement and engagement in the independent study program, as indicated by the student's performance on applicable student-level measures of student achievement and engagement specified in Education Code 52060
	 
	The completion of assignments, assessments, or other indicators that evidence that the student is working on assignments
	 
	Learning of required concepts, as determined by the supervising teacher
	 
	Progress towards successful completion of the course of study or individual course, as determined by the supervising teacher

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747 mandates the Board to adopt policy that includes the provision of content aligned to grade level standards that is substantially equivalent to in-person instruction. For high schools, this requirement includes access to all courses offered by the district for graduation and approved by the University of California or the California State University as creditable under the A-G admissions criteria. See BP/AR 6143 - Courses of Study.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that students participating in independent study are provided with content aligned to grade level standards at a level of quality and intellectual challenge substantially equivalent to in-person instruction. For high schools, this shall include access to all courses offered by the district for graduation and approved by the University of California (UC) or the California State University (CSU) as creditable under the A-G admissions criteria.  (Education Code 51747)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747 mandates the Board to adopt policy that includes plans, by grade level, to provide students with specified levels of live interaction and/or synchronous instruction as described in Items #1-3 below and defined in the accompanying administrative regulation. Education Code 51747, as amended by SB 153, makes this requirement applicable only when students are participating in an independent study program for 16 school days, or more, in a school year. Pursuant to Education Code 51747, this requirement is not applicable to students enrolled in a comprehensive school for classroom-based instruction who participate in independent study due to necessary medical treatments or inpatient treatment for mental health care or substance abuse, as described below.Pursuant to Education Code 51747.5, the district may claim apportionment credit for independent study only to the extent of the time value of student work products as personally judged by a certificated employee of the district, or the combined time value of student work products and participation in synchronous instruction, as long as the synchronous instructional offering augments the time value of the student work product and evidence of student participation is furnished and maintained. Pursuant to Education Code 51747.5, as amended by SB 153, work products may include the daily time value spent by a student engaged in asynchronous instruction, including work completed on an online or computer-based instructional activity, regardless of whether student work products are produced, if the computer program documents student participation. Education Code 51747.5, as amended by AB 176, clarifies that the district is required to maintain documentation of hours or fraction of an hour for both student work products and the time that the student engaged in asynchronous instruction. Evidence of student participation may include, but is not limited to, student work produced or performed, or documentation that the student participated in an instructional period either visually or verbally, as verified by a certificated employee and maintained by the district for each hour or fraction of an hour of the synchronous instructional offering. See "Records", below.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all students participating in independent study for 16 school days or more in a school year receive the following throughout the school year:  (Education Code 51747)

	For students in grades transitional kindergarten (TK)-3, opportunities for daily synchronous instruction
	 
	For students in grades 4-8, opportunities for both daily live interaction and at least weekly synchronous instruction
	 
	For students in grades 9-12, opportunities for at least weekly synchronous instruction

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747 mandates the Board to adopt policy that includes procedures for tiered reengagement strategies for students who meet the conditions specified in Items #1-3 below. Education Code 51747, as amended by SB 153, makes this requirement applicable only when students are participating in an independent study program for 16 school days, or more, in a school year. Pursuant to Education Code 51747, this requirement is also not applicable to students who participate in independent study due to necessary medical treatments or inpatient treatment for mental health care or substance abuse, as described below.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that procedures for tiered reengagement strategies are used for all students participating in an independent study program for 16 school days or more in a school year who are:  (Education Code 51747)

	Not generating attendance for more than ten percent of required minimum instructional time over four continuous weeks of the district's approved instructional calendar
	 
	Not participating in synchronous instructional offerings pursuant to Education Code 51747.5 for more than 50 percent of the scheduled times of synchronous instruction in a school month as applicable by grade span
	 
	In violation of their written agreement

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747 requires that the district's tiered reengagement strategies procedures include local programs intended to address chronic absenteeism, as applicable.
Tiered reengagement strategies procedures used in district independent study programs shall include local programs intended to address chronic absenteeism, as applicable, including but not limited to the following:  (Education Code 51747)

	Verification of current contact information for each enrolled student
	 
	Notification to parents/guardians of lack of participation within one school day of the recording of a nonattendance day or lack of participation
	 
	A plan for outreach from the school to determine student needs, including connection with health and social services as necessary
	 
	A clear standard for requiring a student-parent-educator conference to review a student's written agreement and reconsider the independent study program's impact on the student's achievement and well-being

CSBA NOTE:  Education Code 51747 mandates the Board to adopt policy that includes a plan to expeditiously, and not longer than five instructional days, transition students whose families wish to return to in-person instruction from independent study. Education Code 51747, as amended by SB 153, makes this requirement applicable only when students are participating in an independent study program for 16 school days, or more, in a school year.  Pursuant to Education Code 51747, the requirement is also not applicable to students who participate in independent study due to necessary medical treatments or inpatient treatment for mental health care or substance abuse, as described below.
The Superintendent or designee shall, for students who participate in an independent study program for 16 school days or more in a school year, develop a plan to transition students whose families wish to return to in-person instruction from independent study expeditiously, and, in no case, later than five instructional days.  (Education Code 51747)

CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to Education Code 51747, the live interaction and/ or synchronous learning requirements, tiered reengagement strategies, and transition plan obligations do not apply to students enrolled in a comprehensive school for classroom-based instruction who, under the care of an appropriate licensed professional(s), participate in independent study due to necessary medical treatments or inpatient treatment for mental health care or substance abuse, provided the district obtains evidence of the need as specified in Education Code 51747.
When any student enrolled in classroom-based instruction is participating in independent study due to necessary medical treatment or inpatient treatment for mental health or substance abuse under the care of appropriately licensed professionals, the student shall be exempt from the live interaction and/or synchronous instruction, tiered reengagement strategies, and transition back to in-person instruction requirements specified above. In such cases, evidence from appropriately licensed professionals, of the student's need to participate in independent study, shall be submitted to the Superintendent or designee.  (Education Code 51747)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747 mandates the Board to adopt policy providing that a current written agreement (i.e., the "master agreement") will be maintained for each student who participates in independent study and for whom apportionment is claimed. Education Code 51747 provides that no independent study agreement may be valid for longer than one school year.In addition, Education Code 51749.5 mandates the Board to adopt policy providing that a "learning agreement" be maintained for each student participating in course-based independent study.See "Master Agreement" and "Learning Agreement for Course-Based Independent Study" below for required content of these agreements.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a written agreement exists for each participating student as prescribed by law.  (Education Code 51747, 51749.5)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747 requires districts to hold a student-parent-educator conference upon the request of a parent/guardian prior to making a decision about enrollment or disenrollment in independent study. The term "student-parent-educator conference" is defined in Education Code 51745.5 and reflected in the accompanying administrative regulation.
Upon the request of the parent/guardian of a student, and before signing a written agreement as described below in "Master Agreement," below, the district shall conduct a telephone, videoconference, or in-person student-parent-educator conference or other meeting during which the student, parent/guardian, and, if requested by the parent/guardian an advocate, may ask questions about the educational options, including which curriculum offerings and nonacademic supports will be available to the student in independent study.  (Education Code 51747)

Master Agreement

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747 mandates that, in order to receive apportionments for independent study, the district is required to adopt and implement policy providing for a signed written independent study agreement which contains the components listed in the following section. Pursuant to Education Code 46300, as amended by SB 153, districts may claim independent study average daily attendance for any length of duration. As such, a written agreement is required for independent study of any length of duration.Pursuant to Education Code 51747, as amended by SB 153, the district is required to obtain a signed written agreement for an independent study program of more than 15 school days before the beginning of independent study, and for an independent study program of 15 school days or fewer, during the school year in which the independent study program takes place. Education Code 51747, as amended by SB 153, clarifies that for independent study programs of 15 school days or fewer the agreement may be signed at any time during the school year, but includes legislative intent that parents/guardians be provided the written agreement at or before the beginning of the school year.  However, Education Code 46300.7 states that apportionments shall be received for a student in independent study only if the district receives written permission from the parent/guardian before the independent study begins, specifying the actual dates of participation, methods of study and evaluation, and resources to be made available for the student's independent study. As Education Code 46300.7 and 51747 are inconsistent regarding when written agreements need to be signed for programs of 15 school days or fewer, districts are encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
A written agreement shall be developed and implemented for each student participating in independent study.  (Education Code 46300, 51747)

For student participation lasting 16 school days or more, a signed written agreement shall be obtained before the student begins independent study. For student participation of 15 school days or fewer, a signed written agreement may be obtained at any time during the school year in which the independent study program takes place.  (Education Code 46300, 51747)

The agreement shall include general student data, including the student's name, address, grade level, birth date, school of enrollment, and program placement.

The independent study agreement for each participating student also shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following:  (Education Code 51747; 5 CCR 11700, 11702)

	The manner, time, frequency, and place for submitting the student's assignments, reporting the student's academic progress, and communicating with a student's parent/guardian regarding the student's academic progress
	 
	The objectives and methods of study for the student's work and the methods used to evaluate that work
	 
	The specific resources that will be made available to the student, including materials and personnel, and access to Internet connectivity and devices adequate to participate in the educational program and complete assigned work
	
	CSBA NOTE: As described in "General Independent Study Requirements" above, pursuant to Education Code 51747, the written agreement must contain statements reflecting Board policy pertaining to (1) the maximum length of time, by grade level and type of program, which may elapse between the time an independent study assignment is made and the date by which the student is required to complete the assignment and (2) the number of missed assignments allowed before an evaluation would be required to determine whether it is in a student's best interest to remain in independent study. Education Code 51747 also requires that the written agreement contain a statement of the Board's policy regarding the level of satisfactory educational progress for students participating in independent study.
	A statement of the Board's policy detailing the maximum length of time allowed between an assignment and its completion, the level of satisfactory educational progress, and the number of missed assignments which will give rise to an evaluation of whether the student should be allowed to continue in independent study
	 
	The duration of the independent study agreement, including the beginning and ending dates for the student's participation in independent study under the agreement, with a maximum of one school year
	 
	A statement of the number of course credits or, for the elementary grades, other measures of academic accomplishment appropriate to the agreement, to be earned by the student upon completion
	 
	A statement detailing the academic and other supports that will be provided to address the needs of students who are not performing at grade level, or need support in other areas, such as English learners, students with disabilities with an individualized education program or a Section 504 plan in order to be consistent with their program or plan, students in foster care or experiencing homelessness, and students requiring mental health supports
	 
	A statement that independent study is an optional educational alternative and no student may be required to participate
	 
	In the case of a suspended or expelled student who is referred or assigned to any school, class, or program pursuant to Education Code 48915 or 48917, a statement that instruction may be provided through independent study only if the student is offered the alternative of classroom instruction

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51747, the date upon which a written agreement needs to be signed will vary depending on the projected length of independent study, as specified below.Additionally, for students with disabilities, the certificated employee designated as having responsibility for the special education programming of the student is required to sign the written agreement.
All learning agreements shall be signed by the student, the student's parent/guardian or caregiver if the student is less than 18 years of age, the certificated employee responsible for the general supervision of independent study, and as applicable for students with disabilities, the certificated employee designated as having responsibility for the special education programming of the student. If the independent study program is projected to last for more than 15 school days, the learning agreement shall be signed before the commencement of the program. For an independent study program that is projected to last for 15 or fewer school days, the learning agreement shall be signed at any time during the school year in which the independent study program is to take place.  (Education Code 51747)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Family Code 6550-6552, a person who is 18 years of age or older who completes and signs a caregiver's authorization affidavit declaring that a minor lives at the person's home is authorized as a caregiver to enroll the minor child in school and consent to school-related medical care on behalf of the minor.
For purposes of the above paragraph, caregiver means a person who has met the requirements of Family Code 6550-6552.

Written agreements may be signed using an electronic signature that complies with state and federal standards, as determined by the California Department of Education (CDE).  (Education Code 51747)

The parent/guardian's signature on the agreement shall constitute permission for the student to receive instruction through independent study.

Course-Based Independent Study

	A statement of the number of course credits or, for the elementary grades, other measures of academic accomplishment appropriate to the learning agreement, to be earned by the student upon completion.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51749.6, the date upon which a learning agreement needs to be signed will vary depending on the projected length of an independent study course, as specified below. In addition, for students with disabilities, the certificated employee designated as having responsibility for the special education programming of the student is required to sign the learning agreement.
All learning agreements shall be signed by the student, the student's parent/guardian or caregiver if the student is less than 18 years of age, the certificated employee responsible for the general supervision of the independent study course, and as applicable for students with disabilities, the certificated employee designated as having responsibility for the special education programming of the student. If the independent study program is projected to last for more than 15 school days, the learning agreement shall be signed before the commencement of the program. For an independent study program that is projected to last for 15 or fewer school days, the learning agreement shall be signed at any time during the school year in which the independent study program is to take place.  (Education Code 51749.6)

For purposes of the above paragraph, caregiver means a person who has met the requirements of Family Code 6550-6552.

Learning agreements may be signed using an electronic signature that complies with state and federal standards, as determined by CDE.  (Education Code 51749.6)

A signed learning agreement from a parent/guardian of a student who is less than 18 years of age shall constitute the parent/guardian's permission for the student to receive instruction through course-based independent study.  (Education Code 51749.6)

Upon the request of a student's parent/guardian, and before signing a learning agreement as described above, the district shall conduct a telephone, videoconference, or in-person student-parent-educator conference, or other meeting during which the student, parent/guardian, and, if requested by the parent/guardian, an advocate, may ask questions about the educational options, including which curriculum offerings and nonacademic supports will be available to the student in independent study.  (Education Code 51749.6)

Student-Parent-Educator Conferences

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747 and 51749.5 require districts to hold student-parent-educator conferences as defined by Education Code 51745.5, at specified times. See the accompanying administrative regulation for the definition of student-parent-educator conference.
A student-parent-educator conference shall be held as appropriate including, but not limited to, as a reengagement strategy and/or, if requested by a parent/guardian, prior to enrollment or disenrollment from independent study.  (Education Code 51745.5, 51747, 51749.5)

Records

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51745.6, 51747, 51747.5, and 51749.5, the Education Audit Appeals Panel's, "Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting," includes verification of compliance with specified components of law related to independent study, with loss of apportionment for independent study for districts found to be noncompliant.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that records are maintained for audit purposes.

These records shall include, but not be limited to:  (Education Code 51748; 5 CCR 11703)

	A copy of the Board policy, administrative regulation, and other procedures related to independent study
	 
	A listing of the students, by grade level, program, and school, who have participated in independent study, along with the units of the curriculum attempted and completed by students in grades K-8 and the course credits attempted by and awarded to students in grades 9-12 and adult education
	 
	A file of all agreements, with representative samples of each student's work products bearing the supervising teacher's signed or initialed and dated notations indicating that the teacher has personally evaluated the work or personally reviewed the evaluations made by another certificated teacher
	 
	As appropriate to the program in which the students are participating, a daily or hourly attendance register that is separate from classroom attendance records, maintained on a current basis as time values of student work products judged by a certificated teacher, and reviewed by the supervising teacher if they are two different persons


CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51747.5, as amended by AB 176, clarifies that the district is required to maintain documentation of hours or fraction of an hour for both student work products and the time that the student engaged in asynchronous instruction. As a result, districts will need to document hours or fractions of an hour of work product time before converting to days of attendance.
Additionally, the district shall maintain documentation of hours or fraction of an hour for student work products and the time that students engaged in asynchronous instruction.  (Education Code 54747.5)


	Appropriate documentation of compliance with the teacher-student ratios required by Education Code 51745.6 and 51749.5
	 
	Appropriate documentation of compliance with the requirements pursuant to Education Code 51747.5 to ensure the coordination, evaluation, and supervision of the independent study of each student by a district employee who possesses a valid certification document pursuant to Education Code 44865 or an emergency credential pursuant to Education Code 44300

The district shall document each student's participation in live interaction and synchronous instruction pursuant to Education Code 51747 on each school day, as applicable, in whole or in part, for which live interaction or synchronous instruction is provided as part of the independent study program. A student who does not participate in scheduled live interaction or synchronous instruction shall be documented as non-participatory for that school day.  (Education Code 51747.5)

The Superintendent or designee shall also maintain a written or computer-based record such as a grade book or summary document of student engagement, for each class, of all grades, assignments, and assessments for each student for independent study assignments.  (Education Code 51747.5)

CSBA NOTE:  Education Code 51747 and 51749.6 authorize specified records to be maintained in an electronic file, as provided in the following paragraph. Pursuant to Education Code 51747 and 51749.6, an electronic file includes a computer or electronically stored image of an original document, including, but not limited to, a PDF, JPEG, or other digital file type, that may be sent via fax machine, email, or other electronic means.
Signed written and supplemental agreements, assignment records, work samples, and attendance records may be maintained as an electronic file in accordance with Education Code 51747 and 51749.6, as applicable.

Program Evaluation

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board the number of district students participating in independent study, the average daily attendance generated for apportionment purposes, student performance as measured by standard indicators and in comparison to students in classroom-based instruction, and the number and proportion of independent study students who graduate or successfully complete independent study. Based on the program evaluation, the Board and Superintendent shall determine areas for program improvement, as needed.

The Governing Board authorizes independent study as an optional alternative instructional strategy for students whose needs may be best met through study outside of the regular classroom setting. Independent study shall offer a means of individualizing the educational plan to serve students who desire a more challenging educational experience, whose health or other personal circumstances make classroom attendance difficult, who are unable to access course(s) due to scheduling problems, and/or who need to make up credits or fill gaps in their learning. As necessary to meet student needs, independent study may be offered for short- or long-term placements, on a full-time or part-time basis, and/or in conjunction with part- or full-time classroom study.<br>

The district&#39;s course-based independent study program for students in grades K-12 shall be subject to the following requirements:&nbsp; (Education Code 51749.5)
<ol>
	<li>A signed learning agreement shall be completed and on file for each participating student, pursuant to Education Code 51749.6<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Courses shall be taught under the general supervision of certificated employees who hold the appropriate subject matter credential and are employed by the district or by another district, charter school, or county office of education with which the district has a memorandum of understanding to provide the instruction<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Courses shall be annually certified by Board resolution to be of the same rigor and educational quality and to provide intellectual challenge that is substantially equivalent to in-person, classroom-based instruction, and shall be aligned to all relevant local and state content standards<br>
	<br>
	For high schools, this shall include access to all courses offered by the district for graduation and approved by UC or CSU as creditable under the A-G admissions criteria.<br>
	<br>
	The certification shall, at a minimum, include the duration, number of equivalent daily instructional minutes for each school day that a student is enrolled, number of equivalent total instructional minutes, and number of course credits for each course, consistent with that of equivalent classroom-based courses. Additionally, the certification shall include plans to provide opportunities throughout the school year for all students in TK-3 to receive daily synchronous instruction, for all students in grades 4-8, to receive both daily live interaction and at least weekly synchronous instruction, and for all students in grades 9-12 to receive at least weekly synchronous instruction.<br>

	<br>
	If satisfactory educational progress in one or more independent study courses is not being made, the teacher providing instruction shall notify the student and, if the student is under 18 years of age, the student&#39;s parent/guardian. The teacher shall conduct an evaluation to determine whether it is in the student&#39;s best interest to remain in the course or whether the student should be referred to an alternative program, which may include, but is not limited to, a regular school program.<br>
	<br>
	Procedures for tiered reengagement strategies shall be used for all students who are not making satisfactory educational progress in one or more courses or who are in violation of the written learning agreement, as described in the section &quot;Learning Agreement for Course-Based Independent Study&quot; below. These procedures shall include, but are not necessarily limited to, the verification of current contact information for each enrolled student; a plan for outreach from the school to determine student needs, including connection with health and social services as necessary; and a clear standard for requiring a student-parent-educator conference to review a student&#39;s written agreement and reconsider the independent study program&#39;s impact on the student&#39;s achievement and well-being.<br>

	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The student-teacher ratio in the courses in this program shall be in accordance with Education Code 51745.6<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>For each student, the combined equivalent daily instructional minutes for courses in this program and all other courses shall meet applicable minimum instructional day requirements, and the student shall be offered the minimum annual total equivalent instructional minutes pursuant to Education Code 46200-46208<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Courses required for high school graduation or for admission to UC or CSU shall not be offered exclusively through independent study<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A student participating in this program shall not be assessed a fee that is prohibited by Education Code 49011<br>
