## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide learning opportunities for students beyond the regular school day that support the regular education program in a supervised environment. The content of such programs shall be coordinated with the District's vision and goals for student learning, local control and accountability plan, curriculum, and academic standards.

Each program offered by the District shall be planned through a collaborative process as required by law.  (Education Code 8422, 8482.5, 8484.75, 46120)

The District shall prioritize offering Expanded Learning Opportunities Programs (ELO) at school sites in the lowest income communities, as determined by prior year percentages of students eligible for free and reduced-price meals, while maximizing the number of schools and neighborhoods with ELOs across their attendance area.  (Education Code 46120)

To the extent feasible, the District shall give priority to establishing expanded learning opportunities beyond the regular school day in low-performing schools and/or programs that serve low-income and other at-risk students.

Any expanded learning opportunities, including but not limited to After School Education and Safety  (ASES), 21st Century Community Learning Center (21st CCLC), 21st Century High School After School Safety and Enrichment for Teens (ASSETs), ELO, or any other program to be established pursuant to Education Code 8421, 8482.3, 8484.75, or 46120, shall be approved by the Board. Additionally, the Board shall declare its operational intent to run an ELO to the Superintendent of Public Instruction as specified in Education Code 46120.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all staff who directly supervise students in any expanded learning opportunities possess appropriate knowledge and experience. As needed, staff and volunteers shall receive ongoing training related to their job responsibilities.

Each before-school, after-school, summer, vacation or intersessional expanded learning opportunity shall include academic and enrichment elements in accordance with law and administrative regulation, and may be used in conjunction with attendance recovery programs. Additionally, each program may include support services that reinforce the educational component and promote student health and well-being.

A family fee may be charged to participating families based on the actual cost of services.

For ASES, 21st CCLC, and/or ELO, no fee shall be charged for a student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals, or a student experiencing homelessness, or in foster care. Family fees shall be calculated on a sliding scale that considers family income and ability to pay.  (Education Code 8482.6, 46120)

Eligible students who are 11 or 12 years of age shall be placed in a before-school or after-school program, if and when available, rather than subsidized child-care and development services. During the time that the before-school or after-school program does not operate, such students may be provided the option of enrolling in child-care and development services in accordance with the enrollment priorities established in Administrative Regulation 5148 - Child Care and Development.  (Welfare and Institutions Code 10273)

The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall monitor student participation rates and shall identify multiple measures that shall be used to evaluate program effectiveness. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, student outcome data; program self-assessments; feedback from staff, participating students, and parents/guardians; and observations of program activities.

Every three years, the Superintendent or designee shall review the after-school program plan, including, but not limited to, program goals, program content, and outcome measures. Documentation of the program plan shall be maintained for a minimum of five years in accordance with law and as specified in Board Policy/Administrative Record 3580 - District Records and Board Policy/Administrative Record 5125 - Student Records.  (Education Code 8482.3, 46120)
