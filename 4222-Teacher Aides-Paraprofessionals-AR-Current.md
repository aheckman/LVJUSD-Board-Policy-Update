Qualifications

CSBA NOTE: The following section may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 45330, 45344.5, and 45361.5 require paraprofessionals who will be assigned to assist in instruction to demonstrate proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics equivalent to or exceeding the proficiency required for high school seniors in the district or, if the district does not maintain high schools, in the high school district that includes all or a portion of the district. Pursuant to Education Code 45330, the district must ensure that any educational qualifications or proficiency exam established by the district is appropriate to the responsibilities to be assigned to the paraprofessional. According to the California Department of Education's (CDE) web site, many districts use the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) for the purpose of determining proficiency of paraprofessionals.The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) (P.L. 114-95) repealed 20 USC  6319 which contained additional requirements pertaining to the qualifications of paraprofessionals working in programs supported by federal Title I funds and required the principal to attest to the school's compliance. However, 20 USC 6311, as amended by P.L. 114-95, requires that the state plan implementing ESSA include requirements addressing qualifications of such paraprofessionals. According to the CDE, the only requirement applicable to Title I paraprofessionals for the 2016-17 school year is the requirement to demonstrate proficiency on a local proficiency exam. Thus, requirements for Title I paraprofessionals are the same as for all other paraprofessionals.
No person shall be initially assigned to assist in instruction as a paraprofessional unless he/she has demonstrated proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics skills up to or exceeding that required for local high school seniors pursuant to Education Code 51220(a) and (f). (Education Code 45330, 45344.5, 45361.5)

A paraprofessional who has passed a proficiency test in another district and was employed in the same capacity shall be considered to have met the district's proficiency standards, unless the district determines that the other district's test is not comparable. (Education Code 45344.5, 45361.5)

Duties

CSBA NOTE: The following section applies to duties of all paraprofessionals and may be expanded to reflect district practice. The repeal of 20 USC  6319 by P.L. 114-95 eliminated additional requirements related to allowable duties that may be assigned to paraprofessionals in Title I programs, as well as the requirement that the principal annually attest to the school's compliance.
A paraprofessional shall perform only such duties as, in the judgment of the certificated personnel to whom the paraprofessional is assigned, may be performed by a person not licensed as a classroom teacher. These duties shall not include assignment of grades to students. (Education Code 45330)

Instructional aides need not perform their duties only in the physical presence of the teacher, but the teacher shall retain responsibility for the instruction and supervision of the students in his/her charge. (Education Code 45344)

Parental Notification

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph applies to districts that receive Title I funds and may be used or revised by other districts. 20 USC 6312, as amended by P.L. 114-95, contains the following notification requirement formerly in 20 USC 6311.
At the beginning of each school year, parents/guardians shall be notified that they may request information regarding whether their child is provided services by a paraprofessional and, if so, the paraprofessional's qualifications. (20 USC 6312)
