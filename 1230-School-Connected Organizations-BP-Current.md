## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy should be revised to reflect district practice.For purposes of this Board policy, the term "school-connected organization" includes booster clubs, parent-teacher associations aligned with the California State PTA, or other parent-teacher organizations. These organizations generally raise funds for classroom activities or activities at specific schools. For policy regarding educational foundations, see BP 1260 - Educational Foundation. For policy regarding associated student body organizations, see BP 3452 - Student Activity Funds.In some districts, there may be legal or equity concerns that result from the benefit provided to a particular school while other schools in the district do not receive the benefit from the additional resources. For example, pursuant to state and federal law (Education Code 200-262.4; 5 CCR 4900-4965; 20 USC 1681-1688), the Governing Board is responsible for ensuring that the district's athletic program provides equivalent opportunities for both males and females. Booster club activities must be included in the district's analysis of the equivalent opportunities provided by each school. See BP/AR 6145.2 - Athletic Competition. Because school-connected organizations are generally separate legal entities, if a concern arises regarding the equitable distribution of funds, the Superintendent or designee should consult with the leadership of such organizations and district legal counsel. For language regarding acceptance of gifts and grants, see BP 3290 - Gifts, Grants, and Bequests.
The Governing Board recognizes that parents/guardians and community members may wish to organize parent organizations and/or booster clubs for the purpose of supporting the district's educational and extracurricular programs. The Board appreciates the contributions made by such organizations toward the Board's vision for student learning and for providing all district students with high-quality educational opportunities.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. See the accompanying administrative regulation for details regarding the types of information that the district might require to be included in a school-connected organization's request to operate within the district or school.
Persons proposing to establish a school-connected organization shall submit a request to the Board for authorization to operate within the district or at a district school.

CSBA NOTE: Generally, booster and parent clubs are separate legal entities from the district and thus are not under the control or the responsibility of district personnel. The district should consult legal counsel if it has any questions about its appropriate relationship with school-connected organizations.Certain tax-exempt organizations may be required to register with the state Attorney General's Registry of Charitable Trusts. As part of this registration, the organization may also be required to file copies of the organization's articles of incorporation and other documents governing its operations.
A school-connected organization, including a booster club, parent-teacher association or organization, or other organization that does not include an associated student body or other student organization, shall be established and maintained as a separate entity from the school or district. Each school-connected organization shall be subject to its own bylaws and operational procedures or to the rules or bylaws of its affiliated state or national organization, as applicable.

CSBA NOTE: School-connected organizations are required to comply with applicable laws. For example, food sales by outside organizations must not compete with the district's school nutrition program and must comply with state and/or federal nutritional standards (Education Code 49431-49431.7; 5 CCR 15500-15501, 15575-15578; 7 CFR 210.11, 220.12). See BP/AR 3554 - Other Food Sales.
In addition, activities by school-connected organizations shall be conducted in accordance with law, Board policies, administrative regulations, and any rules of the sponsoring school.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. The Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT), in its 2015 ASB Accounting Manual, Fraud Prevention Guide and Desk Reference, suggests rules governing the relationship between the district and booster clubs and other school-connected organizations. For examples of such rules, see the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish appropriate rules for the relationship between school-connected organizations and the district.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51521 requires that any fundraising activity designed to raise money to benefit a school or its students receive approval from the Board or the Board's designee. The following paragraph delegates this authority to the Superintendent or designee and may be revised to reflect district practice.
A school-connected organization shall obtain the written approval of the Superintendent or designee prior to soliciting funds upon the representation that the funds will be used wholly or in part for the benefit of a district school or the students at that school.  (Education Code 51521)

A school-connected organization may consult with the principal to determine school needs and priorities.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49011, the district is permitted to solicit voluntary donations, participate in fundraising activities, or provide prizes or other recognition for participants in fundraising activities. However, the district must not offer or award to a student any course credit or privileges related to educational activities in exchange for voluntary donations or participation in fundraising activities by or on behalf of the student and shall not remove, or threaten to remove, from a student any course credit or privileges related to educational activities, or otherwise discriminate against the student, due to a lack of voluntary donations or participation in fundraising activities by or on behalf of the student. See BP 3260 - Fees and Charges.
Any participation in fundraising activities by students and their parents/guardians and/or any donation of funds or property shall be voluntary.  (Education Code 49011)
