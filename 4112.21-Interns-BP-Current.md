## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that employ interns through one or more intern programs approved by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC).Intern programs allow individuals to be employed as fully paid teachers of record while completing a teacher preparation program. "University intern programs" are administered by colleges and universities in partnership with school districts pursuant to Education Code 44450-44468, and "district intern programs" are administered by school districts in consultation with colleges or universities pursuant to Education Code 44325-44328 and 44830.3.AB 97 (Ch. 47, Statutes of 2013) eliminated the alternative certification program which was designed to address teacher shortages in geographic or subject matter areas (Education Code 44380-44387) and the enhanced intern program (Education Code 44387) and redirected the funding for those programs into the local control funding formula.
The district may employ interns as necessary to fulfill the need for sufficient instructional staff and to provide future teachers an opportunity to link teaching theory with practice in order to meet state credentialing requirements. In addition, the district may employ teachers who already possess a preliminary or clear credential and are pursuing a credential in a different specialization as interns for positions that require such other credential.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect the type(s) of intern programs available through the district.  All intern programs are subject to CTC program standards and preconditions for program approval.  These are available on the CTC web site and in its handbooks SB 2042 Multiple Subject and Single Subject Preliminary Credential Program Standards and Education Specialist Teaching and Other Related Services Credential Program Standards
The district may enter into partnership agreements with one or more approved teacher preparation programs sponsored by colleges or universities and/or may provide a district intern program with approval of the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). Any intern program in which the district participates shall be aligned with the preconditions and program standards adopted by the CTC.

CSBA NOTE: When the district is unable to hire a "fully prepared" teacher who has completed a teacher preparation program (i.e., a teacher who holds a clear or preliminary teaching credential), Education Code 44225.7 permits the district to hire a teacher without those credentials. Education Code 44225.7 establishes a hierarchy for such hires which gives priority to individuals who are enrolled in an approved intern program in the region of the district; see BP 4112.2 - Certification. CTC Coded Correspondence 13-01 clarifies that such an individual must possess a CTC-issued intern credential.
The Superintendent or designee shall make reasonable efforts to recruit an intern from an approved program within the region whenever a teacher with a preliminary or clear credential is not available for a position requiring certification.  (Education Code 44225.7)

CSBA NOTE: Before recommending a candidate for the intern credential, the intern program must certify that the candidate possesses the required qualifications pursuant to Education Code 44325 and 44453 and 5 CCR 80033, as added by Register 2014, No. 7.Pursuant to Education Code 44455-44456, candidates participating in a university intern program may be granted an intern credential of any type for a period of two years, which may subsequently be extended for one year if the CTC determines that the intern needs additional time to complete the requirements for the preliminary credential due to extenuating circumstances. Pursuant to Education Code 44325, candidates participating in a district intern program may be granted a multiple subject or single subject intern credential for two years or an education specialist intern credential for three years, and may seek a one-year extension.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any intern employed by the district possesses an appropriate intern credential and is adequately prepared for the responsibilities of the position.

An intern may be assigned to provide the same service as a holder of a regular multiple subject, single subject, or education specialist credential in accordance with the authorizations and grade/age level specified on the intern credential.  (Education Code 44454, 44325, 44326, 44830.3)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44466 and 44885.5, an employee shall be classified as a probationaryemployee while serving as an intern and for one succeeding school year following completion of the intern program if he/she is reelected to serve in a position requiring certification qualifications.  In districts that grant permanent status to certificated staff, the employee would then be granted permanent status if reelected to a certificated position for the subsequent school year. See AR 4116 - Probationary/Permanent Status.  Because this area of law is complex, the district should consult with legal counsel as to the appropriate terms of employment for interns.
Terms of employment for interns shall be consistent with law and the district's collective bargaining agreement, as applicable.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44466 and 44885.5, an employee shall be classified as a probationary employee while serving as an intern and for one succeeding school year following completion of the intern program if he/she is reelected to serve in a position requiring certification qualifications. In districts that grant permanent status to certificated staff, the employee would then be granted permanent status if reelected to a certificated position for the subsequent school year. See AR 4116 - Probationary/Permanent Status. Because this area of law is complex, the district should consult with legal counsel as to the appropriate terms of employment for interns.
Interns shall receive intensive, structured supervision and ongoing support by qualified personnel in order to enhance their instructional skills and knowledge. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that district staff serving as supervisors, mentor teachers, or other support providers receive appropriate training to fulfill their responsibilities and that they maintain frequent communication with the interns they are assigned to assist.

Interns shall be provided with ongoing feedback regarding their performance and shall be formally evaluated in accordance with Board policy and the district's collective bargaining agreement.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 44328 and 44830.3, after an intern has completed service sufficient to meet program standards and performance assessments, the Governing Board may recommend to the CTC that the district intern be awarded a preliminary teaching credential. Education Code 44468 contains similar provisions for interns who fulfill the early completion option for either the university or district intern program; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
Upon receiving notification from the Superintendent or designee that an intern has successfully completed the program, the Governing Board may recommend to the CTC that the intern be awarded a preliminary credential.  (Education Code 44328, 44468, 44830.3)

The Board shall regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the intern program(s) to determine whether changes are needed in the support and/or assignment of interns. The Board's evaluation shall be based on a report by the Superintendent or designee, including, but not limited to, data on student performance in classes taught by interns, feedback from interns and supervisors, and the number of interns who successfully complete the program and obtain general education or education specialist credentials.
