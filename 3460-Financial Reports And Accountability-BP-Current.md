## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is optional and should be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board is committed to ensuring public accountability and the fiscal health of the district. The Board shall adopt sound fiscal management policies and practices, oversee the district's financial condition, and continually evaluate whether the district's budget and financial operations support the district's goals for student achievement.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph sets the Governing Board's expectation that the district's financial reports will adhere to generally accepted financial and accounting standards. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is a nonprofit agency that establishes financial and accounting standards for state and local government agencies, including school districts. By using the California Department of Education's (CDE) standardized account code structure (SACS) software to develop financial reports, the district will be assured of complying with generally accepted accounting principles prescribed by GASB and meeting other state and federal reporting guidelines.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that district financial reports are prepared in accordance with law and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and financial reporting standards stipulated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board and the California Department of Education (CDE). The Superintendent or designee shall establish a system of ongoing internal controls to ensure the reliability of financial reporting.

When required by law or as directed by the Board, the Superintendent or designee shall submit to the Board reports of the district's financial status, including, but not limited to, any report specified in this Board policy or accompanying administrative regulation. When submission of any such report to a local, state, and/or federal agency requires prior Board approval, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the report to the Board in sufficient time to enable the Board to carefully review the report without breaking any applicable submission deadline.

CSBA NOTE: The Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT) is an independent entity whose primary mission is to help districts identify, prevent, and resolve financial, operational, and data management challenges, including assisting districts to avert fiscal insolvency, providing districts with fiscal management assistance, and creating efficient organizational operations. According to FCMAT's, "Indicators of Risk or Potential Insolvency for K-12 Local Education Agencies," the indicators of risk or potential insolvency include conditions related to unreliable budget development, insufficient budget monitoring or updates, inadequate cash management, mismanaged collective bargaining agreements, increasing and/or unplanned contributions and transfers, continuing deficit spending, mismanaged employee benefits, inattention to enrollment and attendance reporting, decreasing fund balance and reserve for economic uncertainty, ineffective internal controls and fraud prevention, breakdown in leadership and communication, lack of multiyear planning, inattention to non-voter-approved debt and risk management, lack of position control, and other issues of concern.In reviewing the district's budget, the County Superintendent of Schools is required by Education Code 42127 and 42127.6 to consider any studies, reports, evaluations, or audits of the district that contain evidence of fiscal distress based on the standards and criteria specified in Education Code 33127 or a finding that the district is in moderate or high risk of intervention based on the most common FCMAT indicators of a district needing intervention; see BP/AR 3100 - Budget. In the event of any such evidence or finding, or if the district is showing fiscal distress under state criteria and standards for budgets or interim reports, as specified in 5 CCR 15440-15451 and 15453-15464, the County Superintendent is required to investigate whether the district may be unable to meet the current year's or two subsequent fiscal years' financial obligations.
The Board shall regularly assess the district's financial position and communicate the results to the public, and shall use financial reports to determine the actions and budget amendments, if any, that are needed to ensure the district's financial stability. If district conditions predict fiscal distress or indicate that the district might not be able to meet its fiscal obligations, the Board and Superintendent or designee shall take action to resolve these conditions without delay. The Board shall work cooperatively with the County Superintendent of Schools to improve the district's fiscal health and may contract with an external individual or organization to provide the district with needed advice or fiscal management or training.

CSBA NOTE: When a district is fiscally insolvent and is considering applying to the state for an emergency apportionment that exceeds 200 percent of the recommended reserve for that district, Education Code 41326 requires the Board to first discuss the need for that apportionment at a regular or special meeting. At that meeting, the Board is required to receive testimony from parents/guardians, exclusive representatives of employees of the district, and other community members. Any district that receives such an apportionment is subject to the conditions set forth in Education Code 41326, including assumption of all the Board's legal rights, duties, and powers by the County Superintendent, who is required to appoint, with concurrence from the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) and President of the State Board of Education (SBE), or the President's designee, an administrator to exercise the authority.
If the district is facing fiscal insolvency, the Board may consider applying to the state for an emergency apportionment that exceeds 200 percent of the district's recommended reserve. Before applying for such emergency apportionment, the Board shall discuss, at a regular or special meeting, the need for an emergency apportionment and receive testimony regarding the apportionment from parents/guardians, the exclusive representatives of employees of the district, and other members of the community.  (Education Code 41326)

Unaudited Actual Receipts and Expenditures

On or before September 15, the Board shall approve and file with the County Superintendent a statement of the district's unaudited actual receipts and expenditures for the preceding fiscal year. The Superintendent or designee shall prepare this statement using the state's standardized account code structure (SACS) as prescribed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI).  (Education Code 42100)

Gann Appropriations Limit Resolution

On or before September 15, the Board shall, at a regular or special meeting, adopt a resolution identifying, pursuant to Government Code 7900-7914, the district's estimated appropriations limit for the current fiscal year and the actual appropriations limit for the preceding fiscal year. Documentation used to identify these limits shall be made available to the public on the day of the Board meeting.  (Education Code 42132; Government Code 7910)

Interim Reports/Certification of Ability to Meet Fiscal Obligations

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42130 requires that the district issue two interim reports, as described below, based on the criteria and standards for fiscal stability adopted by SBE pursuant to Education Code 33127. These criteria and standards are delineated in 5 CCR 15453-15464. See the accompanying administrative regulation for further information about the contents of the interim reports.
Each fiscal year, the Superintendent or designee shall submit two interim reports to the Board. The first report shall cover the district's financial and budgetary status for the period ending October 31 and the second report shall cover the period ending January 31. These reports and supporting data shall be made available by the district for public review.  (Education Code 42130)

Within 45 days after the close of the period reported, the Board shall approve the interim report and, on the basis of the interim report and any additional financial information known by the Board, shall certify in writing whether the district will be able to meet its fiscal obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year and, based on current forecasts, for the two subsequent fiscal years. The certification shall be classified as one of the following:  (Education Code 42130, 42131)

	"Positive certification" indicating that the district will meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and two subsequent fiscal years
	 
	"Qualified certification" indicating that the district may not meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year or two subsequent fiscal years
	 
	"Negative certification" indicating that the district will be unable to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year or the subsequent fiscal year

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42130 and 42131 require that the interim report and certification be submitted to the County Superintendent in a format or on forms prescribed by the SPI. CDE requires that these be reported using the SACS software. Pursuant to Education Code 42131, upon receiving the certification, the County Superintendent is required to send any qualified or negative certification, along with the interim report, to the State Controller and the SPI.
The Superintendent or designee shall submit a copy of each interim report and certification to the County Superintendent using the state's SACS software, as prescribed by the SPI.  (Education Code 42130, 42131)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42131 gives the County Superintendent 75 days after the close of the reporting period to downgrade the district's positive certification to qualified or negative or a qualified certification to negative. Districts may appeal the County Superintendent's determination to the SPI, who will then determine the certification to be given to the district.
If the district's certification is subsequently changed by the County Superintendent from a positive to a qualified or negative certification, or from a qualified to a negative certification, the Board may appeal the decision to the SPI within five days of receiving the notice of change.  (Education Code 42131)

CSBA NOTE: Whenever the district receives a qualified or negative certification, Education Code 42131 requires the County Superintendent, within 75 days after the close of the reporting period, to submit comments on the certification to the State Controller and the SPI and report any remedial action proposed or taken under the authority granted by Education Code 42127.6. Pursuant to Education Code 42127.6, the County Superintendent is required to take one or more of the following actions: (1) assign a fiscal expert to advise the district on the financial problems; (2) conduct a study of the district's financial and budgetary conditions including, but not limited to, a review of internal controls; (3) direct the district to submit a financial projection of all fund and cash balances as of June 30 of the current year and subsequent fiscal years; (4) require the district to encumber all contracts and other obligations, prepare appropriate cash flow analyses and monthly or quarterly budget revisions, and appropriately record all receivables and payables; (5) direct the district to submit a proposal for addressing the fiscal conditions that caused the negative or qualified certification; (6) withhold Board stipend and Superintendent compensation if requested financial information is not provided; and/or (7) assign FCMAT to review and provide recommendations to improve the district's teacher hiring process, teacher retention rate, percentage of provision of highly qualified teachers, and extent of teacher misassignment. Education Code 42131 also authorizes the State Controller to conduct an audit or review of the financial condition of any district having a negative or qualified certification.Pursuant to Education Code 42652, a district that receives a qualified or negative certification also may lose the County Superintendent's or SPI's approval to draw warrants on the county treasury. Furthermore, pursuant to Education Code 42133, a district that receives a qualified or negative certification must have the County Superintendent's approval before issuing any certificates of participation, tax anticipation notes, revenue bonds, or other non-voter-approved debt; see the section "Non-Voter-Approved Debt Report" in the accompanying administrative regulation.Whenever a district with a qualified or negative certification is negotiating a collective bargaining agreement, it must allow the County Superintendent 10 working days to review and comment on the proposed collective bargaining agreement pursuant to Government Code 3540.2; see BP 4143/4243 - Negotiations/Consultation.
Whenever the district receives a qualified or negative certification from the Board or the County Superintendent, the Superintendent or designee shall cooperate in the implementation of any remedial actions taken or prescribed by the County Superintendent.  (Education Code 42131)

CSBA NOTE: Whenever the district's second interim report is accompanied by a qualified or negative certification, the district must submit another financial statement by June 1 as described below; this report is sometimes referred to as the "third interim report."
If the second interim report is accompanied by a qualified or negative certification, the Board shall, no later than June 1, provide to the County Superintendent, the State Controller, and the SPI a financial statement as of April 30 ("third interim report") that projects the district's fund and cash balances through June 30.  (Education Code 42131)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42637 authorizes the County Superintendent, upon concluding at any time during the fiscal year that the district's budget does not comply with criteria and standards for fiscal stability adopted by SBE, to conduct a comprehensive review of the district's financial and budgetary conditions and, if such a review is conducted, requires the County Superintendent to report the findings to the Board at a public meeting. According to FCMAT's, "Fiscal Oversight Guide," the County Superintendent must exercise this authority when the district receives a negative certification and is authorized to do so when the district receives a qualified certification. After receiving the report, the Board is required to respond to the recommendations within 15 days.
If at any time during the fiscal year, the County Superintendent concludes that the district's budget does not comply with the standards and criteria for financial stability and conducts a comprehensive review of the district's financial and budgetary conditions, the Board shall review any report of the County Superintendent's findings and recommendations at a public Board meeting. Within 15 days of receiving the report, the district shall notify the County Superintendent and the SPI of the Board's proposed actions on the recommendation.  (Education Code 42637)

Audit Report

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 41020, the Board must, no later than May 1 of each year, arrange for an audit of all the district's funds. However, if the Board has not provided for an audit by April 1, the County Superintendent must do so at the district's cost. Thus, the paragraph below reflects the April 1 deadline.Pursuant to Education Code 41020, any district contract for auditing services must be approved by the Board and the County Superintendent if the district has a disapproved budget, has received a negative certification on any budget or interim report during the current fiscal year or either of the two preceding fiscal years, or has otherwise been determined by the County Superintendent to have a lack of going concern.
By April 1 of each year, the Board shall provide for an annual audit of the district's books and accounts.  (Education Code 41020)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 41020 requires the Board to select an auditor from a directory of certified public accountants and public accountants deemed by the State Controller as qualified to conduct audits of local education agencies. The State Controller is required to publish this directory by December 31 of each year.In addition, Education Code 41020.5 prohibits the Board from employing any accountant identified by the State Controller as ineligible based on failure of past audits to comply with provisions of the K-12 annual audit guide. The State Controller will annually notify districts of ineligible accountants by March 1.
To conduct the audit, the Board shall select a certified public accountant or public accountant licensed by the State Board of Accountancy from among those deemed qualified by the State Controller.  (Education Code 41020, 41020.5)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 41020 requires that districts rotate auditors as specified below. However, the district may request that the Education Audit Appeals Panel waive this requirement if no otherwise eligible auditor is available to perform the audit.
Except when, as determined by the Education Audits Appeal Panel, no otherwise eligible auditor is available, a public accounting firm whose lead or coordinating audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit or whose audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit has performed audit services for the district in each of the six previous fiscal years shall not be selected to perform a district audit.  (Education Code 41020)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 41020.3 requires the Board to review the audit report at an open meeting by January 31 of each year. However, Education Code 41020 requires that the audit report be filed with the County Superintendent, CDE, and State Controller no later than December 15. Thus, it is recommended that the Board conduct its review of the audit prior to December 15 whenever possible.
No later than December 15, the report of the audit for the preceding fiscal year shall be filed with the County Superintendent, CDE, and the State Controller.  (Education Code 41020)

Prior to December 15 whenever possible, but in no case later than January 31, the Board shall review, at an open meeting, the annual district audit for the prior year, any audit exceptions identified in that audit, the recommendations or findings of any management letter issued by the auditor, and any description of correction or plans to correct any exceptions or any issue raised in a management letter.  (Education Code 41020.3)

The Board shall have an opportunity at the meeting to ask questions of the auditor and request further information about the audit findings.

Audit Committee

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice. Although it is the responsibility of district staff to prepare financial statements and the responsibility of the independent auditor to assure that the information in the statements is reliable and fairly presented, establishment of an audit committee provides an additional mechanism to ensure fiscal responsibility, as well as providing an opportunity for community participation. Committees established by Board action are subject to the Brown Act; see BP/AR 1220 - Citizen Advisory Committees and BB 9130 - Board Committees.
The Board may appoint an audit committee composed of staff knowledgeable about fiscal matters, other staff, and representatives of the community.

The committee shall serve in an advisory capacity and may:

	Make recommendations regarding the selection of the external independent auditor in accordance with Education Code 41020 and 41020.5
	 
	Review the plan for the audit process with the independent auditor to determine the adequacy of the nature, scope, and timetable of the audit
	 
	Review the results of the audit and participate with the independent auditor and management in preparing final recommendations and responses
	 
	Participate with the independent auditor in presenting the audit report to the Board
	 
	Review Board policies and administrative regulations to recommend any revisions needed to ensure effective financial reporting
	 
	Provide input on the effectiveness of the independent auditor
	 
	Periodically report to the Board regarding the status of previous audit recommendations for improving the accounting and internal control systems

In the event of any such evidence or finding, or if the district is showing fiscal distress under state criteria and standards for budgets or interim reports, as specified in 5 CCR 15440-15451 and 15453-15464, the County Superintendent is required to investigate whether the district may be unable to meet the current year's or two subsequent fiscal years' financial obligations.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="zNzMNA2" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22zNzMNA2%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22EOQ7%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1694537189%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20Fiscal%20Crisis%20and%20Management%20Assistance%20Team%20%28FCMAT%29%20is%20an%20independent%20entity%20whose%20primary%20mission%20is%20to%20help%20districts%20identify%2C%20prevent%2C%20and%20resolve%20financial%2C%20operational%2C%20and%20data%20management%20challenges%2C%20including%20assisting%20districts%20to%20avert%20fiscal%20insolvency%2C%20providing%20districts%20with%20fiscal%20management%20assistance%2C%20and%20creating%20efficient%20organizational%20operations.%20According%20to%20FCMAT%27s%2C%20%5C%22Indicators%20of%20Risk%20or%20Potential%20Insolvency%20for%20K-12%20Local%20Education%20Agencies%2C%5C%22%20the%20indicators%20of%20risk%20or%20potential%20insolvency%20include%20conditions%20related%20to%20unreliable%20budget%20development%2C%20insufficient%20budget%20monitoring%20or%20updates%2C%20inadequate%20cash%20management%2C%20mismanaged%20collective%20bargaining%20agreements%2C%20increasing%20and/or%20unplanned%20contributions%20and%20transfers%2C%20continuing%20deficit%20spending%2C%20mismanaged%20employee%20benefits%2C%20inattention%20to%20enrollment%20and%20attendance%20reporting%2C%20decreasing%20fund%20balance%20and%20reserve%20for%20economic%20uncertainty%2C%20ineffective%20internal%20controls%20and%20fraud%20prevention%2C%20breakdown%20in%20leadership%20and%20communication%2C%20lack%20of%20multiyear%20planning%2C%20inattention%20to%20non-voter-approved%20debt%20and%20risk%20management%2C%20lack%20of%20position%20control%2C%20and%20other%20issues%20of%20concern.%5Cn%5CnIn%20reviewing%20the%20district%27s%20budget%2C%20the%20County%20Superintendent%20of%20Schools%20is%20required%20by%20Education%20Code%2042127%20and%2042127.6%20to%20consider%20any%20studies%2C%20reports%2C%20evaluations%2C%20or%20audits%20of%20the%20district%20that%20contain%20evidence%20of%20fiscal%20distress%20based%20on%20the%20standards%20and%20criteria%20specified%20in%20Education%20Code%2033127%20or%20a%20finding%20that%20the%20district%20is%20in%20moderate%20or%20high%20risk%20of%20intervention%20based%20on%20the%20most%20common%20FCMAT%20indicators%20of%20a%20district%20needing%20intervention%3B%20see%20BP/AR%203100%20-%20Budget.%20In%20the%20event%20of%20any%20such%20evidence%20or%20finding%2C%20or%20if%20the%20district%20is%20showing%20fiscal%20distress%20under%20state%20criteria%20and%20standards%20for%20budgets%20or%20interim%20reports%2C%20as%20specified%20in%205%20CCR%2015440-15451%20and%2015453-15464%2C%20the%20County%20Superintendent%20is%20required%20to%20investigate%20whether%20the%20district%20may%20be%20unable%20to%20meet%20the%20current%20year%27s%20or%20two%20subsequent%20fiscal%20years%27%20financial%20obligations.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-zNzMNA2" title="CSBA NOTE: The Fiscal Crisis and Management Assist..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

Committees established by Board action are subject to the Brown Act; see BP/AR 1220 - Citizen Advisory Committees and BB 9130 - Board Committees.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="zNzMNA14" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22zNzMNA14%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22zNA19%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1694537774%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20following%20optional%20section%20may%20be%20revised%20to%20reflect%20district%20practice.%20Although%20it%20is%20the%20responsibility%20of%20district%20staff%20to%20prepare%20financial%20statements%20and%20the%20responsibility%20of%20the%20independent%20auditor%20to%20assure%20that%20the%20information%20in%20the%20statements%20is%20reliable%20and%20fairly%20presented%2C%20establishment%20of%20an%20audit%20committee%20provides%20an%20additional%20mechanism%20to%20ensure%20fiscal%20responsibility%2C%20as%20well%20as%20providing%20an%20opportunity%20for%20community%20participation.%20Committees%20established%20by%20Board%20action%20are%20subject%20to%20the%20Brown%20Act%3B%20see%20BP/AR%201220%20-%20Citizen%20Advisory%20Committees%20and%20BB%209130%20-%20Board%20Committees.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-zNzMNA14" title="CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be r..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
