Schoolwide Programs

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6314, Title I funds may be used and consolidated with other federal, state, and local program funds to upgrade the entire educational program in schools that meet eligibility criteria. Schools participating in schoolwide programs are not required to identify particular students as eligible or identify individual services as supplementary. The following optional section is for use by districts with schoolwide program(s).
A school may operate a Title I schoolwide program in order to upgrade the entire educational program of the school when at least 40 percent of the students in the school attendance area, or at least 40 percent of the students enrolled in the school, are from low-income families.  (20 USC 6314; 34 CFR 200.25)

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6314 provides that an ineligible school may request a waiver from the California Department of Education (CDE) to operate a schoolwide program, taking into account how a schoolwide program will best serve the needs of the students in the school. For information regarding the criteria and process for seeking a waiver, see the CDE's web site.
A school that does not meet these criteria may operate a Title I schoolwide program if it receives a waiver from the California Department of Education.  (20 USC 6314)

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6314 requires schools with Title I schoolwide programs to develop a comprehensive plan with specified components. Pursuant to Education Code 64001, this plan must be consolidated with plans required for other federal and state categorical programs into a school plan for student achievement (SPSA). The SPSA must be developed by a school site council; see BP/AR 0420 - School Plans/Site Councils. However, because 20 USC 6314 requires broader engagement, the district must ensure that plan development provides opportunities for the participation of the individuals listed below. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
Any school operating a schoolwide program shall develop a comprehensive plan with the involvement of parents/guardians, other members of the community to be served, and individuals who will carry out the plan, including teachers, principals, other school leaders, paraprofessionals present in the school, administrators (including administrators of other federal education programs), the district, tribes and tribal organizations present in the community, and, if appropriate, specialized instructional support personnel, technical assistance providers, school staff, secondary school students as applicable, and other individuals determined by the school.  (20 USC 6314)

The schoolwide program plan shall be based on a comprehensive needs assessment of the entire school and shall be incorporated into a single plan for student achievement which also incorporates the plans required for other categorical programs included in the state's consolidated application.  (Education Code 64001; 20 USC 6314)

The plan shall describe the strategies that the school will implement to address school needs, including a description of how such strategies will:  (20 USC 6314)
 

	Provide opportunities for all students, including economically disadvantaged students, ethnic subgroups, students with disabilities, and English learners, to meet state academic standards
	 
	Use methods and instructional strategies that strengthen the school's academic program, increase the amount and quality of learning time, and help provide an enriched and accelerated curriculum, which may include programs, activities, and courses necessary to provide a well-rounded education
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #3 may be revised to reflect the grade levels and programs offered by the district.
	Address the needs of all students in the school, but particularly the needs of those at risk of not meeting state academic standards, through activities which may include the following:
	 
	
		Counseling, school-based mental health programs, specialized instructional support services, mentoring services, and other strategies to improve students' skills outside the academic subject areas
		 
		Preparation for and awareness of opportunities for postsecondary education and the workforce, which may include career and technical education programs and broadening secondary school students' access to coursework to earn postsecondary credit while still in high school
		 
		Implementation of a schoolwide tiered model to prevent and address problem behavior, and early intervention services, coordinated with similar activities and services carried out under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
		 
		Professional development and other activities for teachers, paraprofessionals, and other school personnel to improve instruction and use of data from academic assessments and to recruit and retain effective teachers, particularly in high-need subjects
		 
		Strategies for assisting preschool children in the transition from early childhood education programs to local elementary school programs
	
	


The plan shall also include a description of any applicable federal, state, and local programs that will be consolidated in the schoolwide program.  (20 USC 6314; 34 CFR 200.27)

The plan and its implementation shall be regularly monitored and revised as necessary based on student needs to ensure that all students are provided opportunities to meet state academic standards.  (20 USC 6314)

Targeted Assistance Programs

CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to 20 USC 6315, any school that is selected to receive Title I funds but is ineligible for or chooses not to operate a schoolwide program may only use Title I funds for programs that provide services to eligible students identified as having the greatest need for special assistance.The following paragraph may be revised to reflect grade levels offered by the district.
Any school that receives Title I funds but does not operate a schoolwide program shall use Title I funds to provide services to eligible students who are failing, or most at risk of failing, to meet state academic standards. Students shall be identified on the basis of multiple, educationally related, objective criteria, except that students in preschool through grade 2 shall be selected solely on the basis of criteria, including objective criteria, established by the district and supplemented by the school.  (20 USC 6315)

Eligible students include those who are economically disadvantaged; students with disabilities; migrant students, including those who participated in a migrant education program pursuant to 20 USC 6391-6399 in the preceding two years; English learners; students who participated in a Head Start or state preschool program in the preceding two years; students in a local institution for neglected or delinquent children and youth or attending a community day program for such students; and homeless students.  (20 USC 6315)

Any targeted assistance program shall:  (20 USC 6315)
 

	Use program resources to help participating students meet state academic standards, which may include programs, activities, and academic courses necessary to provide a well-rounded education
	 
	Use methods and instructional strategies that strengthen the academic program, through activities which may include:
	 
	
		Expanded learning time, before- and after-school programs, and summer programs and opportunities
		 
		A schoolwide tiered model to prevent and address behavior problems, and early intervention services, coordinated with similar activities and services carried out under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
		 
	
	
	Coordinate with and support the regular education program, which may include services to assist preschool students in the transition to elementary school programs
	 
	Provide professional development to teachers, principals, other school leaders, paraprofessionals, and, if appropriate, specialized instructional support personnel and other school personnel who work with eligible students in Title I programs or in the regular education program. The professional development shall be provided using funds from Title I and, to the extent practicable, other sources.
	 
	Implement strategies to increase the involvement of parents/guardians of participating students
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #6 may be revised to reflect programs offered by the district.
	If appropriate and applicable, coordinate and integrate federal, state, and local services and programs, such as programs supported by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, violence prevention programs, nutrition programs, housing programs, Head Start programs, adult education programs, career technical education programs, and comprehensive or targeted support and improvement activities under 20 USC 6311
	 
	Provide assurances to the Superintendent or designee that the program will:
	 
	
		Help provide an accelerated, high-quality curriculum
		 
		Minimize the removal of students from the regular classroom during regular school hours for instruction supported by Title I funds
		 
		On an ongoing basis, review the progress of participating students and revise the targeted assistance program, if necessary, to provide additional assistance to enable such students to meet state academic standards
	
	


Participation of Private School Students

Teachers and families of participating private school students shall have an opportunity to participate, on an equitable basis, in parent/guardian and family engagement activities and professional development pursuant to 20 USC 6318.  (20 USC 6320, 7881)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph reflects U.S. Department of Education non-regulatory guidance, Title I Services to Eligible Private School Students.
Each year the Superintendent or designee shall contact officials of private schools with students who reside within district boundaries, regardless of whether the private school they attend is located within the district or whether or not those officials have previously indicated any interest in program participation, and invite them to a meeting to discuss the intent of Title I and the roles of public and private school officials.

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6320 requires meaningful and timely consultation with private school officials as described below. Pursuant to 20 USC 6320, a private school official has the right to complain to the CDE that the district did not comply with these requirements, and the district must forward the appropriate documentation to the CDE.
The Superintendent or designee shall consult with appropriate private school officials, in a meaningful and timely manner, during the design and development of the district's Title I programs, with the goal of reaching agreement on how to provide equitable and effective programs for eligible private school students. Such consultation shall occur before the district makes any decision that affects the opportunities of eligible private school students to participate in Title I programs and shall include consultation on issues such as the following:  (20 USC 6320, 7881; 34 CFR 200.56)
 

	How the needs of private school students will be identified
	 
	What services will be offered
	 
	How, where, and by whom the services will be provided
	 
	How the services will be academically assessed and how assessment results will be used to improve those services
	 
	The size and scope of the equitable services to be provided to eligible private school students, the proportion of funds to be allocated for such services, and how that proportion of funds is determined
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6320, the district has the final authority to calculate, each year or every two years, the number of private school students, ages 5-17, who are from low-income families. The district may use the same measure of low income as used to determine eligibility for public school students or any other measure listed in 20 USC 6320(c)(1).
	The method or sources of data that are used to determine the number of students from low-income families in participating school attendance areas who attend private schools
	 
	How and when the district will make decisions about the delivery of services to such students, including a thorough consideration and analysis of the views of private school officials on the provision of services through a third-party provider
	 
	How, if the district disagrees with the views of private school officials on the provision of services through a third-party provider, the district will provide to private school officials a written analysis of the reasons that the district has chosen not to use a contractor
	 
	Whether the district will provide services directly or through a separate government agency, consortium, entity, or third-party contractor
	 
	Whether to provide services to eligible private school students by pooling funds or on a school-by-school basis
	 
	When services will be provided, including the approximate time of day
	 
	Whether to consolidate and use funds provided under Title I with other funds available for services to private school students


If the district disagrees with the views of private school officials with respect to any of the above issues, the district shall provide the officials, in writing, the reasons that the district disagrees.  (20 USC 6320)

Meetings between district and private school officials shall continue throughout implementation and assessment of services.  (20 USC 6320)

The district shall maintain, and shall provide to the CDE, a written affirmation signed by officials of each participating private school that consultation has occurred. The affirmation shall provide the option for private school officials to indicate their belief that timely and meaningful consultation has not occurred or that the program design is not equitable with respect to private school students. If private school officials do not provide the affirmation within a reasonable period of time, the district shall send documentation to the CDE demonstrating that the consultation has, or attempts at such consultation have, taken place.  (20 USC 6320)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall also maintain copies of program descriptions, notices, funding allocations, and other communications and records pertaining to the provision of services to private school students.
