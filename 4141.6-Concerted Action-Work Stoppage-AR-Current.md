## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional regulation may be revised to reflect district practice.The legality of public employee work stoppages in California is not specifically addressed in statutes and depends on the type of work stoppage, what provoked it and other circumstances. Generally, the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) has exclusive jurisdiction to determine if a strike is protected or unprotected under the Educational Employment Relations Act (Government Code 3540-3549.3). Districts may request that PERB seek an injunction to stop a strike or to limit certain strike behavior.
Maintenance of District Operations

During any work stoppage, strike, or other concerted employee activity, the Superintendent or designee shall take measures to minimize disruption to district operations and student learning.  At the discretion of the Superintendent or designee, employees reporting for duty may be temporarily assigned to other duties. In addition, the Superintendent or designee may hire qualified substitute and/or temporary employees as needed to maintain district operations and shall recommend to the Governing Board an appropriate rate of pay for such employees for the period of the work stoppage.

Strike Plan

The Superintendent or designee may establish a committee to develop a plan in the event of a work stoppage.  This committee may include district-level staff, legal counsel, the district's negotiator and parents/guardians.

	Internal communications among district staff and the Board during a work stoppage

	Communications with parents/guardians, the media, business partners, public officials and other community members that identify key messages, strategies and district spokespersons
	 
	Equipment and supply needs
	 
	Desirability and feasibility of conducting extracurricular activities during a work stoppage including an analysis of the number of events and activities that would be affected, the availability of staffing, the degree of student and/or community participation and the ability to provide adequate security at events
	 
	Contingency plans for transportation
	 
	Contingency plans for the provision of food services
	 
	Identification of outside resources who may be called upon to help with school operations
	 
	Coordination with law enforcement and other agencies
	 
	Appropriate safeguards for the safety of students, working employees, substitutes, volunteers, parent/guardians and Board members
	 
	Provisions for safe, effective board meetings
	 
	Cost estimates for the various strategies to be implemented during a work stoppage
	 
	Legal remedies available to enjoin the work stoppage if possible or to file unfair labor practice charges against the employee organization
	 
	Continuation of negotiations during a work stoppage
	 
	Plans for resuming normal district operations, rebuilding relations and disciplining employees if necessary after the work stoppage

Activities of Employees

CSBA NOTE: In situations where strikes by employees are protected by the EERA, not all strike behavior is legal and employees who engage in unprotected activity may be subject to disciplinary action. Under most circumstances, peaceful picketing in areas considered public forums, distributing handbills or leaflets to employees or the public and letter writing are protected by the U.S. Constitution and California Constitution. However, picketers have no right to violate criminal laws or engage in misconduct which "may reasonably tend to coerce or intimidate [nonstriking] employees in the exercise of their rights" (Fresno Unified School District).
The district shall not impose or threaten to impose reprisals, discriminate or threaten to discriminate, or otherwise interfere with, restrain or coerce employees for the exercise of their rights.  (Government Code 3543.5-3543.6)

Employees engaging in a work stoppage shall not prevent access to school facilities by other employees, substitutes or students; use or threaten physical violence or bodily injury; trespass; distribute malicious or defamatory leaflets or materials; or otherwise coerce or intimidate individuals in the conduct of school business.

During an actual or threatened work stoppage, an employee shall not retain any district property, including but not limited to student attendance and grading records, lesson plans, keys, equipment and supplies.

CSBA NOTE: PERB has found certain employee strike activities related to students to be unprotected under the EERA, including sending notes about a labor dispute to parents/guardians through the students as well as addressing students during duty time by stopping a school bus to encourage students to support a strike (Konocti Unified School District).
Employees shall not use students to distribute messages that promote or explain the position of any employee organization that is contemplating or engaged in a work stoppage.  In addition, employees shall not use classroom or other duty time to promote an employee organization's position in negotiations or in a work stoppage.

When students raise questions related to a work stoppage, teachers shall approach the subject in accordance with the district's policy on controversial issues and shall not allow such discussions to interfere with their regular teaching responsibilities. 

Salary and Benefits

Employees withholding services shall not receive salary or unemployment benefits during the period of the work stoppage.

CSBA NOTE: The district should consult legal counsel regarding its obligations to continue to pay benefits during a work stoppage and revise the following section accordingly. The district may be required to continue certain benefits depending on the number of days employees are absent from work or to offer employees an opportunity to pay for their own coverage.Government Code 3140-3142, (the Public Employee Health Protection Act), as added by AB 237 (Ch. 740, Statutes of 2021), prohibits California public employers, including school districts and county offices of education, from discontinuing employer contributions for health care or medical coverage for employees who, during an authorized strike, fall below the minimum work hours required to qualify for coverage.  An employer that violates this law may be required to restore any premiums, contributions, or out-of-pocket expenses paid by an employee as a result of the employer's violation.
Any employee withholding services may be subject to the loss of payroll deduction privileges.

Throughout the duration of any enrolled employee’s participation in an authorized strike, the district shall not fail or refuse to maintain and pay for the employee’s continued health care or other medical coverage or the coverage of their enrolled dependents, nor shall the district fail to collect and remit the employee’s contributions to any such coverage.  The district shall maintain the coverage at the same level and under the same conditions that the coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued to work in the employee's position for the duration of the strike.  Health care or other medical coverage for this purpose includes coverage for medical, dental, vision, behavioral health, disability, accidental death and dismemberment, life, and supplemental health insurance benefits.  (Government Code 3141-3142)

“Authorized strike” means a strike sanctioned by the central labor council or the membership of an employee organization that represents the striking employees, or one that is engaged in by unrepresented employees.  (Government Code 3141)

Employees whose vacation leave has been authorized prior to the work stoppage shall receive vacation pay for the authorized period.

If an employee is on a paid sick or disability leave when the work stoppage begins, the employee shall be entitled to continued payment as long as the employee remains ill or disabled and is otherwise eligible according to Board policy and collective bargaining agreements.

The Superintendent or designee may determine that credit shall not be applied toward probationary service, salary schedule advancement, permanent status, vacation earnings, retirement credit or sick leave accrual during the period of time that employees withhold services.
