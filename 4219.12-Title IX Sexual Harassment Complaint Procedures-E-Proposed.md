The District also prohibits retaliation against any employee for filing a complaint or exercising any right granted under Title IX.

The District shall take prompt and equitable action to address any potential Title IX violations that are brought to its attention.  Any inquiries about the application of Title IX, this notice, and who is protected by Title IX may be referred to the District's Title IX Coordinator, to the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education, or both.
