## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation may be used as a component of a comprehensive safety plan and should be modified to reflect district practice. See BP/AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety PlanAdditionally, 6 USC 665k, as added by the Luke and Alex School Safety Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-159), requires the creation of a Federal Clearinghouse on School Safety Evidence-Based Practices to serve as a federal resource to identify and publish online evidence-based practices and recommendations to improve school safety.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a campus security plan which contributes to a positive school climate, fosters social and emotional learning and student well-being, and includes strategies to:

	Secure the campus perimeter and school facilities in order to prevent criminal activity
	
	These strategies include a risk management analysis of each campus' security system, lighting system, and fencing.  Procedures to ensure unobstructed views and eliminate blind spots caused by doorways and landscaping shall also be considered.  In addition, parking lot design may be studied, including methods to discourage through traffic.
	 
	Secure buildings and interior spaces from outsiders and discourage trespassing
	
	These strategies may include installing locks, requiring visitor registration, providing staff and student identification tags, and patrolling places used for congregating and loitering.
	
	 CSBA NOTE: Government Code 11549.3, as amended by AB 1352 (Ch. 593, Statutes of 2021), authorizes districts, at district expense, to request the Military Department, in consultation with the California Cybersecurity Integration Center, to perform an independent security assessment of the district or individual district school. Districts are encouraged to consult with the California Office of Emergency Services (OES) and utilize resources such as the State Threat Assessment System and Regional Fusion Centers to help assess potential threats. For more information see OES' web site.Pursuant to Education Code 35266, as added by AB 2355 (Ch. 498, Statutes of 2022), districts that experience a cyberattack, as defined, which impacts more than 500 students or personnel, are required to report such cyberattack to the California Cybersecurity Integration Center.
	Secure the district's network infrastructure and web applications from cyberattacks
	
	These strategies may include performing an independent security assessment of the district's network infrastructure and selected web applications.
	 
	Discourage vandalism and graffiti
	
	These strategies may include plans to immediately cover graffiti and implement campus beautification.
	 
	Control access to keys and other school inventory
	 
	Detect and intervene with school crime
	
	These strategies may include creating a school watch program, increasing adult presence and supervision, establishing an anonymous crime reporting system, monitoring suspicious and/or threatening digital media content, analyzing school crime incidents, and collaborating with local law enforcement agencies, including providing for law enforcement presence.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49390 and 49393, as added by SB 906 (Ch. 144, Statutes of 2022), require certificated and classified employees of the district, or other school officials such as Governing Board members, whose duties bring the employee or other school official in contact on a regular basis with students in any of grades 6-12, as part of a middle school or high school, who are alerted to or observe any threat or perceived threat of a homicidal act, as defined, to immediately report the threat or perceived threat to law enforcement in accordance with Education Code 49393. "Threat or perceived threat" means any writing or action of a student that creates a reasonable suspicion that the student is preparing to commit a homicidal act related to school or a school activity. This may include possession, use, or depictions of firearms, ammunition, shootings, or targets in association with infliction of physical harm, destruction, or death in a social media post, journal, class note, or other media associated with the student. It may also include a warning by a parent, student, or other individual.
	Additionally, all staff shall be made aware of their responsibilities regarding the immediate reporting of potential homicidal acts to law enforcement, and receive training in the assessment and reporting of such threats.

All staff shall receive training in building and grounds security procedures and emergency response.

Locks

All state-funded new construction and modernization projects shall include locks that allow doors to classrooms and any room with an occupancy of five or more persons to be locked from the inside.  Student restrooms and doors that lock from the outside at all times are not required to have locks that can be locked from the inside.  (Education Code 17075.50, 17583; 24 CCR 1010.2, 1010.2.8.2)

Keys

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section should be modified to reflect district practice.
The principal or designee shall be responsible for all keys used in a school. Keys shall be issued only to authorized employees who regularly need a key in order to carry out job responsibilities.

The principal or designee shall create a key control system with a record of each key assigned and room(s) or building(s) which the key opens.

Keys shall never be loaned to students, parents/guardians, or volunteers, nor shall the master key ever be loaned.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Penal Code 469, a person who knowingly possesses, makes, duplicates, uses, or attempts to use, make, or duplicate a key without authorization may be guilty of a misdemeanor.
Any person issued a key shall be responsible for its safekeeping.  The duplication of school keys is prohibited.  If a key is lost, the person responsible shall immediately report the loss to the principal or designee and shall pay for a replacement key.
