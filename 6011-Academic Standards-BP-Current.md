## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.Education Code 60605-60605.9 require the State Board of Education (SBE) to adopt statewide standards in specified core subject areas and authorize the SBE to adopt model standards in other subject areas. Statewide standards serve as the basis for the state's curriculum frameworks and state assessment of core curriculum areas. To date, the SBE has adopted Common Core State Standards for English language arts and mathematics and California Next Generation Science Standards, all aligned with a set of voluntary national standards, as well as content standards for English language development, health education, history-social science, physical education, visual and performing arts, world languages, career technical education, and school library standards for students (information literacy). Pursuant to Education Code 60605.4, K-12 content standards for computer science are expected to be submitted to the SBE by July 31, 2019. Voluntary "preschool learning foundations," which describe the knowledge, skills, and competencies that children are expected to exhibit as they complete their first or second year of preschool, are under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of Public Instruction rather than the SBE; see BP 5148.3 - Preschool/Early Childhood Education.Although the state standards are "models" rather than mandates, it is expected that the Governing Board will adopt local standards that meet or exceed the state standards. In addition, the Board may choose to adopt content standards in other subjects that are not addressed in the state standards.
The Governing Board shall adopt high standards for student achievement which challenge all students to reach their full potential and specify what students are expected to know and to be able to do at each grade level and in each area of study.  These standards shall reflect the knowledge and skills needed for students to be adequately prepared for postsecondary education, employment, and responsible citizenship.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board with recommended standards using a process that involves teachers, school site and district administrators, students, parents/guardians, representatives from business/industry and postsecondary institutions, and/or community members.  He/she shall ensure the proper articulation of standards between grade levels and the alignment of the standards with the district's vision and goals, graduation requirements, college entrance requirements, and other desired student outcomes. He/she also shall ensure that the standards are easily understandable and measurable.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph should be revised to reflect the courses of study offered by the district.
District content standards for English language arts, English language development, mathematics, science, health education, history-social science, physical education, visual and performing arts, world languages, career technical education, and preschool education shall meet or exceed statewide model content standards adopted by the State Board of Education or the State Superintendent of Public Instruction as applicable.

CSBA NOTE: In evaluating certificated employees, Education Code 44662 requires the Board to use standards of expected student achievement at each grade level in each area of study; see BP/AR 4115 - Evaluation/Supervision.
District curriculum, instruction, student assessments, and evaluations of the instructional program shall be aligned with district content standards.  In accordance with Education Code 44662, standards of expected student achievement also shall be used in evaluating teacher performance.

Teachers and school administrators shall receive ongoing professional development to inform them of changes in the standards and to build their capacity to implement effective standards-based instructional methodologies.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually communicate the applicable standards to students and their parents/guardians to inform them of the expectations for student learning at their grade level.

Staff shall continually assess students' progress toward meeting the standards, report each student's progress to the student and his/her parents/guardians, and offer remedial assistance in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that district standards are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. At a minimum, district standards shall be reviewed whenever applicable statewide standards are revised and in response to changing student needs.
