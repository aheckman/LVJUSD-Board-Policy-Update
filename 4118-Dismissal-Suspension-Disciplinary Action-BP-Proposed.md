## Policy Content

The Board of Education expects all employees to perform their jobs satisfactorily, exhibit professional and appropriate conduct, and serve as positive role models both at school and in the community. A certificated employee may be disciplined for conduct or performance in accordance with law, the applicable collective bargaining agreement, Board policy, or administrative regulation.

Disciplinary action shall be based on the particular facts and circumstances involved and the severity of the conduct or performance.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that disciplinary actions are appropriately documented and taken in a consistent, nondiscriminatory manner. In addition, an employee shall not be suspended, disciplined, reassigned, transferred, dismissed, or otherwise retaliated against solely for engaging in protected activities, or for acting to protect a student engaged in exercising any free speech or press right authorized by, or for refusing to infringe upon a student's conduct protected pursuant to, Education Code 48907 or 48950.

Disciplinary actions may include, but are not limited to, verbal and written warnings, suspension or leave without pay, or dismissal.

Suspension/Dismissal Procedures

The Superintendent shall notify the Board whenever there is cause to suspend or dismiss an employee pursuant to Education Code 44932 or 44933.

When the Board finds that there is cause to suspend or dismiss an employee pursuant to Education Code 44932 or 44933, it may formulate a written statement of charges specifying instances of behavior and the acts or omissions constituting the charge, the statutes and rules that the employee is alleged to have violated when applicable, and the facts relevant to each charge. The Board shall also review any duly signed and verified written statement of charges filed by any other person.  (Education Code 44934, 44934.1)

Based on the written statement of charges, the Board may, upon majority vote, give notice to the employee of the Board's intention to suspend or dismiss the employee at the expiration of 30 days from the date the notice is served.  (Education Code 44934, 44934.1)

Prior to serving a suspension or dismissal notice that includes a charge of unsatisfactory performance, the District shall give the employee written notice of the unsatisfactory performance that specifies the nature of the unsatisfactory performance with such specific instances of behavior and with such particularity as to furnish the employee an opportunity to correct the faults and overcome the grounds for any unsatisfactory performance charges and, if applicable, that includes the evaluation made pursuant to Education Code 44660-44665. The written notice of the unsatisfactory performance shall be provided at least 90 days prior to the filing of the suspension or dismissal notice or prior to the last one-fourth of the school days in the year.  (Education Code 44938)

Prior to serving a suspension or dismissal notice that includes a charge of unprofessional conduct, the District shall give the employee written notice that describes the nature of the unprofessional conduct with such specific instances of behavior and with such particularity as to furnish the employee an opportunity to correct the faults and overcome the grounds for any unprofessional conduct charges and, if applicable, that includes the evaluation made pursuant to Education Code 44660-44665. The written notice of the unprofessional conduct shall be provided at least 45 days prior to the filing of the suspension or dismissal notice.  (Education Code 44938)

Except for notices that only include charges of unsatisfactory performance, the written suspension or dismissal notice may be served at any time of year. Such notice shall be served upon the employee personally if given outside of the instructional year or, if given during the instructional year, may be served personally or by registered mail to the employee's last known address. Notices with a charge of unsatisfactory performance shall be given only during the instructional year of the school site where the employee is physically employed and may be served personally or by registered mail to the employee's last known address.  (Education Code 44936)

If an employee has been served notice and demands a hearing pursuant to Government Code 11505 and 11506, the Board shall either rescind its action or schedule a hearing on the matter.  (Education Code 44941, 44941.1, 44943, 44944)

Pending suspension or dismissal proceedings for an employee who is charged with egregious misconduct, immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude, incompetency due to mental disability, or willful refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause as prescribed by District rules and regulations, the Board may, if it deems it necessary, immediately suspend the employee from assigned duties. If the employee files a motion with the Office of Administrative Hearings for immediate reversal of the suspension based on a cause other than egregious misconduct, the Board may file a written response before or at the time of the hearing.  (Education Code 44939, 44939.1)

When a suspension or dismissal hearing is to be conducted by a Commission on Professional Competence, the Board shall, no later than 45 days before the date set for the hearing, select one person with a currently valid credential to serve on the Commission. The appointee shall not be an employee of the District and shall have at least three years' experience within the past 10 years at the same grade span or assignment as the employee, as defined in Education Code 44944.  (Education Code 44944)

Compulsory Leave of Absence

Upon being informed that a certificated employee has been charged with a mandatory leave of absence offense, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately place the employee on a compulsory leave of absence.  (Education Code 44940, 44940.5)
