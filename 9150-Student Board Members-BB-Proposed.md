Additionally, the student Board member(s) shall receive monthly compensation of $100. A student Board member who receives monthly compensation shall receive compensation when absent from a Board meeting if the Board, by resolution duly adopted and included in its minutes, finds that at the time of the Board meeting the student Board member was performing services outside the Board meeting for the District, was ill, was on jury duty, or was absent due to a hardship considered acceptable by the Board.  (Education Code 35120)

Within 60 days of receiving a student petition, or at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting if no meeting is held within those 60 days, the Board shall adopt a Board bylaw or amend this Board bylaw to create at least one student Board member position on the Board.  (Education Code 35012)

If the District has more high schools than student Board member positions, the student Board member position(s) shall rotate annually between the high schools of the District.

The term of the student Board member(s) shall be one year, commencing each July 1. The Board may adjust the term of a student Board member only if a vacancy occurs or to provide more students with an opportunity to serve on the Board.  (Education Code 35012)

Role and Responsibilities of Student Board Members

The student Board member(s) shall have the right to attend all Board meetings except closed sessions.  (Education Code 35012)

The student Board member(s) shall also be invited to attend staff briefings, or be provided with a separate staff briefing, within the same timeframe as the briefing of other Board members. Additionally, the student Board member(s) shall receive all materials given to Board members between meetings, except for materials that pertain to closed session items, at the same time they are presented to other Board members.  (Education Code 35012)

The student Board member(s) shall be recognized at Board meetings as full member(s), shall be seated with other members of the Board, and shall be allowed to participate in questioning witnesses and discussing issues.  (Education Code 35012)

The student Board member(s) shall be allowed to cast preferential votes on all matters except those subject to closed session discussion. Preferential voting means a formal expression of opinion that is recorded in the minutes and cast before the official vote of the Board. Preferential votes shall not affect the final numerical outcome of a vote.  (Education Code 35012)

The student Board member(s) shall not be considered members of the Board for purposes of the Brown Act.  (Education Code 35012)

On a case-by-case basis, the student Board member(s) may make restorative justice recommendations to the Board regarding specific expulsion matters. In order for such a recommendation to be made, the student who is subject to the expulsion and that student's parent/guardian shall first provide written consent. If such consent is given, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the student Board member(s) with information regarding the expulsion but only to the extent necessary for the student Board member(s) to provide a recommendation related to restorative justice to the Board.  (Education Code 35012)

Student Board Member Training

The Superintendent or designee may, at District expense, provide learning opportunities to the student Board member(s) through trainings, workshops, and conferences, such as those offered by the California School Boards Association and other organizations, to enhance their knowledge, understanding, and performance of leadership skills and their Board responsibilities.

The Superintendent or designee may periodically provide information to student Board member candidates to give them an understanding of the position. Once selected, the incoming student Board member(s) shall be provided an orientation designed to build knowledge of the District and an understanding of the responsibilities and expectations of the position.

Alternate Student Board Member

If the Board determines that a student Board member is not fulfilling the duties of the position, the Board may appoint another student to serve out the term of the student Board member. If an alternate student Board member is appointed, the Board shall suspend the prior student Board member's rights and privileges related to service on the Board.  (Education Code 35012)

Elimination of Student Board Member Position

Once established, the student Board member position shall continue to exist until the Board, by majority vote of all voting Board members, approves a motion to eliminate the position. Such a motion shall be listed as a public agenda item for a Board meeting prior to the motion being voted upon.  (Education Code 35012)
