Site-Level Rules

Site-level rules shall be consistent with state law and Board policies and administrative regulations. In developing site-level disciplinary rules, the principal or designee shall solicit the participation, views and advice of one representative selected by each of the following groups: (Education Code 35291.5)


	Parents/guardians
	 
	Teachers
	 
	School administrators
	 
	School security personnel, if any
	 
	Students in grades seven through twelve


Annually, site-level discipline rules shall be reviewed and, if necessary, updated to align with any changes in state law, District discipline policies and regulations, and/or goals for school safety and climate as specified in the District's local control and accountability plan. A copy of the rules be filed with the Superintendent or designee for inclusion in the comprehensive safety plan.

School rules shall be communicated to students clearly and in an age-appropriate manner.

It shall be the duty of each employee of the school to enforce the school rules on student discipline. (Education Code 35291.5)

Disciplinary Strategies

To the extent possible, staff shall use disciplinary strategies that keep students in school and participating in the instructional program. Except when students' presence causes a danger to themselves or others or they commit a single act of a grave nature or an offense for which suspension or expulsion is required by law, suspension, supervised suspension, or expulsion shall be used only when other means of correction have failed to bring about proper conduct. Disciplinary strategies may include but are not limited to:


	Referral of the student to the school counselor or other school support service personnel for case management and counseling
	 
	Discussion or conference with school staff, the student, and the student's parents/guardians
	 
	Convening of a study team, guidance team, resource panel, or other intervention-related team to assess the behavior and develop and implement an individual plan to address the behavior in partnership with the student and the student's parents/guardians
	 
	When applicable, referral for a comprehensive psychosocial or psychoeducational assessment, including for purposes of creating an individualized education program (IEP) or a Section 504 plan
	 
	Enrollment in a program for teaching prosocial behavior or anger management
	 
	Participation in a restorative justice program
	 
	A positive behavior support approach with tiered interventions that occur during the school day on campus
	 
	After-school programs that address specific behavioral issues or expose students to positive activities and behaviors, including, but not limited to, those operated in collaboration with local parent and community groups
	 
	Participation in a social and emotional learning program that teaches students the ability to understand and manage emotions, develop caring and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relationships, and handle challenging situations capably
	Participation in a program that is sensitive to the traumas experienced by students, focuses on students' behavioral health needs, and addresses those needs in a proactive manner
	 
	Detention after school hours as provided in the section below titled "Detention After School"
	 
	Community service as provided in the section below titled "Community Service"
	 
	In accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation, restriction or disqualification from participation in extracurricular activities
	 
	Reassignment to an alternative educational environment
	 
	Suspension and expulsion in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation

When, by law or District policy, other means of correction are required to be implemented before a student could be suspended or expelled, any other means of correction implemented shall be documented and retained in the student's records.  (Education Code 48900.5)

When a student has been suspended, or other means of correction have been implemented against the student, for an incident of racist bullying, harassment, or intimidation, the principal or designee shall engage both the victim and perpetrator in a restorative justice practice suitable to the needs of the students. The principal or designee shall also require the perpetrator to engage in a culturally sensitive program that promotes racial justice and equity and combats racism and ignorance and shall regularly check on the victim to ensure that the victim is not in danger of suffering from any long-lasting mental health issues.  (Education Code 48900.5)

Staff shall enforce disciplinary rules fairly, consistently, and in accordance with the District's nondiscrimination policies.

When disciplining a student who has been identified for special education and related services, the procedures specified in Administrative Regulation 5144.2 - Suspension And Expulsion/Due Process (Students With Disabilities) shall be applied. If a student has not been identified as a student with a disability and the District suspects the behavior that resulted in discipline may be based in an unidentified disability, the District shall conduct an evaluation to determine if the student has a disability which requires an IEP or 504 plan.  (U.S.C. 1412(a)(3))
Detention After School

Students may be detained for disciplinary reasons up to one hour after the close of the maximum school day, or until the departure of the school bus to which they have been assigned if applicable.. (5 CCR 307, 353)

The student shall not be detained unless the principal or designee notifies the parent/guardian.

Students shall remain under the supervision of a certificated employee during the period of detention.

Students may be offered the choice of serving their detention on Saturday rather than after school.

Community Service

As part of or instead of disciplinary action, the Board, Superintendent, principal or principal's designee may require a student to perform community service during non-school hours on school grounds, or with written permission of the student's parent/guardian off school grounds. Such service may include, but is not limited to, community or school outdoor beautification, community or campus betterment, and teacher, peer or youth assistance programs. (Education Code 48900.6)

This community service option is not available for a student who has been suspended, pending expulsion, pursuant to Education Code 48915. However, if the recommended expulsion is not implemented or the expulsion itself is suspended, then a student may be required to perform community service for the resulting suspension pursuant to this section. (Education Code 48900.6)

Notice to Parents/Guardians and Students

At the beginning of the school year, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians, in writing, about the availability of District rules related to discipline. (Education Code 35291, 48980)

The Superintendent or designee shall also provide written notice of the disciplinary rules to transfer students at the time of their enrollment in the District.
