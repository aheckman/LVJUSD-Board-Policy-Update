NOTICE OF TITLE IX SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY

The District shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in any education program or activity that it operates. The prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex is required by federal law (20 USC 1681-1688; 34 CFR Part 106) and extends to admission and employment. The District also prohibits retaliation against any student for filing a complaint or exercising any right granted under Title IX.

The District shall take prompt and equitable action to address any potential Title IX violations that are brought to its attention. Any inquiries about the application of Title IX, this notice, and who is protected by Title IX may be referred to the District's Title IX Coordinator, to the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education, or both.

The following employee serves as the District's Title IX Coordinator and is responsible for addressing concerns or inquiries regarding discrimination on the basis of sex, including sexual harassment:

Director of Student Services
685 E. Jack London Blvd., Livremore, CA 95441

Any individual may report sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, to the Title IX Coordinator or any other school employee at any time, including during non-business hours, by mail, phone, or email. During District business hours, reports may also be made in person. Upon receiving an allegation of sexual harassment, the Title IX Coordinator shall promptly notify the parties, in writing, of the applicable District complaint procedure.
