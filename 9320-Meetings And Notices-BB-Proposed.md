Consistent with Government Code 54957.5 and Board Bylaw 9322 - Agenda/Meeting Materials, whenever agenda materials relating to an open session of a regular meeting are distributed to the Board less than 72 hours before the meeting, the Superintendent or designee shall make the materials available for public inspection at a public office or location designated for that purpose.
