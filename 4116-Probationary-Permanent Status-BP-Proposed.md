## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to employ and retain highly qualified certificated personnel to implement the District's educational program.  Newly hired certificated personnel shall serve a probationary period during which the Board shall determine their suitability for long-term District employment.

Certificated employees who satisfactorily complete the probationary period shall be granted permanent status.

A probationary employee who has been employed by the District in position(s) requiring certification for two complete consecutive school years and is then reelected for the next succeeding school year shall become a permanent employee at the beginning of the third year.  (Education Code 44929.21, 44929.23)

During the probationary period, employees shall receive professional development and assistance which may consist of inservice training and/or meetings with the employee's evaluator to discuss areas of strength and areas requiring improvement.  Inservice training may be provided during school hours as part of a comprehensive staff development program.

The performance of each probationary employee shall be evaluated and assessed at least once every school year.

Dismissal/Nonreelection of Probationary Employees

During the school year, a probationary employee may be suspended or dismissed only for cause and in accordance with District procedures.  (Education Code 44948.3)

With proper notice, the Board may, without cause, elect not to reemploy a probationary employee for the subsequent year.    (Education Code 44929.21, 44929.23)

The Superintendent or designee shall annually provide the Board with recommendations regarding the reelection or nonreelection of probationary certificated personnel for the ensuing school year.

At any time during a probationary employee's first year of employment in the District, the Board may give written notice to the employee of the Board's decision not to reelect the employee for a second school year.  If the Board does not give written notice, the employee shall be deemed reelected for the next succeeding school year.

During the final year of the probationary period, the Board may decide not to reelect the employee for the following year, and shall so notify the employee in writing on or before March 15.  If the Board does not give written notice on or before March 15, the employee shall be deemed reelected for the next succeeding school year.  (Education Code 44929.21, 44948.5)

Such notices shall be delivered through personal service upon the employee, certified mail with return receipt, email, or another method which documents actual receipt of the notice by the employee.
