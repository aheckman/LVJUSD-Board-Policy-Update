## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes that periodic health examinations of students may lead to early detection and treatment of conditions that impact learning.  Health examinations also may help in determining whether special adaptations of the school program are necessary.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that maintain grades K-8.
The Superintendent or designee shall verify that students have complied with legal requirements for a comprehensive health screening, an oral health assessment, and immunizations at school entry.  In addition, the district shall administer tests for vision, hearing, and scoliosis as required by law.

CSBA NOTE: The California Interscholastic Federation requires students in grades 9-12 to undergo medical examinations before participating in interscholastic competition; see BP 6145.2 - Athletic Competition. Pursuant to Education Code 49458, any examination required for participation in an interscholastic athletic program may be conducted by a physician or physician assistant.The following optional paragraph extends the requirement for a medical examination to athletes at all grade levels and to cheerleaders and song leaders, and may be revised to reflect district practice.
All students who participate as cheerleaders, song leaders, or athletes in organized competitive sports shall first undergo a medical examination and submit documentation of medical clearance to the district.  Upon sustaining an injury or serious illness, a student may be required to have another examination before participating further.  This requirement does not apply to participants in occasional play day or field day activities.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49450 mandates the Board to develop rules for the physical examination of students that ensure their proper care and the confidentiality of their medical records. In November 2008, the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued guidance regarding the application of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to student health records. The guidance clarifies that a student's health record maintained by the district, including a health or medical record maintained by a school nurse who is employed or under contract with a district, is a "student record" subject to FERPA. As such, it may be accessed only by parents/guardians and other persons specifically granted authority by law and those with a legitimate educational interest. See BP/AR 5125 - Student Records.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that staff employed to examine students exercise proper care of each student and that examination results are kept confidential.  Records related to these examinations shall be maintained and released only in accordance with law.
