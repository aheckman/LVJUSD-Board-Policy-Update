## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice and should be aligned with relevant collective bargaining agreement provisions.Additionally, the Governing Board should ensure that district hiring procedures are aligned with law, Board policy, and collective bargaining agreements. In C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School District, the California Supreme Court held that a district can be held vicariously liable for the negligence of its administrators and supervisors in the hiring, retention, and supervision of a counselor who sexually harassed and/or abused a student.The following paragraph reflects concepts from the California Department of Education's (CDE) publication, "How to Increase the Diversity of California's Educator Workforce," and the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing's (CTC) publication, "Strategic Plan: Ensuring Educator Excellence," related to the benefits students receive when staff reflects the racial, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of the district.
The Governing Board is committed to employing suitable, qualified individuals to effectively carry out the district's vision, mission, and goals, and believes that students benefit when district staff reflects the racial, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of the district.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop equitable, fair, and transparent recruitment and selection processes and procedures that ensure individuals are selected for employment in the district based on demonstrated knowledge, skills, and competence and not on any bias, personal preference, or unlawful discrimination.

Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall, through the recruitment and selection processes and procedures, seek to establish and maintain a diverse staff, including the active recruitment from institutions and organizations that serve populations underrepresented among district employees.

When a vacancy occurs, the Superintendent or designee shall review, as appropriate, the job description for the position to ensure that it accurately describes the major functions and duties of the position. The Superintendent or designee shall also disseminate job announcements to ensure a wide range of candidates.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Labor Code 432.3, an employer with 15 or more employees is required to include the pay scale for a position in any job posting.
When posting an employment opportunity, the Superintendent or designee shall include the pay scale for the open position.  (Labor Code 432.2)

The Superintendent shall develop and maintain appropriate hiring procedures to identify the best possible candidates for a position. In doing so, an interview committee may be established to rank candidates and recommend finalists. During job interviews, applicants may be asked to describe or demonstrate how they will be able to perform the duties of the job. All discussions and recommendations shall be confidential and consistent with law.

No inquiry shall be made about any information prohibited by state or federal nondiscrimination laws.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 12954, the district may not discriminate against a person in hiring based on the person's use of cannabis when off the job or away from the workplace. Additionally, Government Code 12954, as amended by SB 700 (Ch. 408, Statutes of 2023), prohibits the district from requesting information from an applicant related to the applicant's prior use of cannabis, apart from the person's criminal history, unless the district is otherwise legally permitted to consider or inquire about that information. However, Government Code 12954 does not interfere with the district's right to maintain drug-free schools or to prohibit employees from possessing, being impaired by, or using cannabis while at work. Government Code 12954 does not preempt state or federal laws requiring applicants to be tested for controlled substances as a condition of employment or to applicants in the building and construction trades or for positions requiring a federal background investigation. The district may utilize drug screenings that do not rely on nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolite results. Districts with questions about applicant cannabis use or screening should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
Unless otherwise provided for in law, the district may not discriminate against a person in hiring based on the person's use of cannabis off the job and away from the workplace, including that the district may not request information from an applicant related to the applicant's prior use of cannabis, apart from the applicant's criminal history, or penalize an applicant based on a drug screening which finds that the applicant has nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolites in the applicant's hair, blood, urine, or other bodily fluid.  (Government Code 12954)

However, the district retains the right to maintain drug-free schools or prohibit employees from possessing, being impaired by, or using cannabis while on the job.  (Government Code 12954)

CSBA NOTE: Labor Code 432.3 prohibits districts from seeking a job applicant's salary history information and from relying on salary history as a factor in determining whether to offer employment to an applicant or the salary to offer. However, if the applicant discloses salary history information voluntarily and without prompting, the district is not prohibited from considering or relying on such information in determining the salary for that applicant. Labor Code 432.3 is not applicable to salary history information that is disclosable pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Government Code 7920.000 - 7930.170) or the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552).
The Superintendent or designee shall not inquire, orally or in writing, about an applicant's salary history information, including compensation and benefits. Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall not rely on salary history information as a factor in determining whether to offer employment to an applicant or the salary to offer. However, the Superintendent or designee may consider salary information that is disclosable under state or federal law or that the applicant discloses voluntarily and without prompting.  (Labor Code 432.3)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph should be modified to reflect district practice.
For each position, the Superintendent or designee shall present to the Board one candidate who meets all qualifications established by law and the Board for the position. No person shall be employed by the Board without the recommendation or endorsement of the Superintendent or designee.

Incentives

CSBA NOTE: Consistent with any applicable collective bargaining agreements, the district may offer incentives (e.g., signing bonuses, assistance with beginning teacher induction costs, assistance with the process of obtaining a clear credential including covering credential costs, a mentoring program, additional compensation, and/or subsidized housing) to recruit teachers, administrators, or other employees in accordance with district needs.SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023) establishes the Diverse Education Leaders Pipeline Initiative to train, place, and retain culturally responsive school administrators to improve student outcomes and meet the needs of California's education workforce.Health and Safety Code 53573 permits districts to establish and implement programs that address the housing needs of teachers and other district employees who face challenges in securing affordable housing. Health and Safety Code 53574 enables housing projects on district property restricted to rentals for district employees to qualify for both federal and state low-income housing tax credits. For more information regarding housing for district employees, see the Center for Cities   Schools (UC Berkeley), cityLAB (UCLA), and the Terner Center for Housing Innovation's (UC Berkeley), "Education Workforce Housing Handbook."The following optional section may be revised to reflect local incentive programs.
With Board approval and in accordance with district needs and any applicable collective bargaining agreements, the district may provide incentives to recruit teachers, administrators, or other employees, such as signing bonuses, assistance with beginning teacher induction and/or credential costs, mentoring, additional compensation, and/or subsidized housing. ​​​​​​​
