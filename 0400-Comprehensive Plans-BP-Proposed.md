## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that careful planning is essential to effective implementation of District programs and policies. Comprehensive plans shall identify cohesive strategies for school improvement, provide stability in District operations, and be aligned to ensure consistency among District approaches for student academic growth and achievement.

Comprehensive plans adopted by the District shall include the local control and accountability plan (LCAP) and other plans required by law or determined by the Board to be in the best interest of the District. Such plans may describe anticipated short- and long-term needs, measurable outcomes, priorities, activities, available resources, timelines, staff responsibilities, and strategies for internal and external communications regarding the plan.

The process for developing comprehensive plans shall include broad participation of school and community representatives. Committees may, and when required by law shall, be appointed to assist in the development of such plans. District comprehensive plans are subject to review and approval by the Board.

School-level plans may be developed to meet the unique circumstances of individual school sites, provided that they are consistent with law, Board policies, District administrative regulations, the District vision, the LCAP, and other Districtwide plans. School plans shall be subject to review and approval of the Superintendent or designee, except when law or Board policy requires Board approval of the plan.

Comprehensive plans shall be available to the public, and shall be reviewed and updated at regular intervals as specified within the plan or required by law.
