Complaint Procedure

Any complaint alleging unlawful discrimination or harassment shall be addressed in accordance with the following procedures:

	Notice and Receipt of Complaint: A complainant may inform a direct supervisor, another supervisor, the coordinator, the Superintendent or, if available, a complaint hotline or an ombudsman. The complainant's direct supervisor may be bypassed in filing a complaint when the supervisor is the subject of the complaint.
	
	The complainant may first attempt to resolve the situation informally with the complainant's supervisor before filing a written complaint.
	
	A supervisor or manager who has received information about an incident of discrimination or harassment, or has observed such an incident, shall report it to the coordinator, whether or not the complainant files a written complaint.
	
	The written complaint should contain the complainant's name, the name of the individual who allegedly committed the act, a description of the incident, the date and location where the incident occurred, any witnesses who may have relevant information, any available evidence of the discrimination or harassment, and any other pertinent information which may assist in investigating and resolving the complaint.
	 
	Investigation Process: The coordinator shall initiate an impartial investigation of an allegation of discrimination or harassment within five business days of receiving notice of the alleged discriminatory or harassing behavior, regardless of whether a written complaint has been filed or whether the written complaint is complete.
	
	The coordinator shall meet with the complainant to describe the District's complaint procedure and discuss the actions being sought by the complainant in response to the allegation. The coordinator shall inform the complainant that the investigation of the allegations will be fair, timely, and thorough and will be conducted in a manner that provides all parties due process and reaches reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected. The coordinator shall also inform the parties that the investigation will be kept confidential to the extent possible, but that some information may be disclosed as necessary to conduct an effective investigation.
	
	If the coordinator determines that a detailed fact-finding investigation is necessary, the investigation shall begin immediately. As part of this investigation, the coordinator should interview the complainant, the person accused, and other persons who could be expected to have relevant information.
	
	The coordinator shall track and document the progress of the investigation to ensure reasonable progress and shall inform the parties as necessary.
	
	When necessary to carry out the investigation or to protect employee safety, the coordinator may discuss the complaint with the Superintendent or designee, District legal counsel, or the District's risk manager.
	
	The coordinator shall also determine whether interim measures, such as scheduling changes, transfers, or leaves, need to be taken before the investigation is completed in order to prevent further incidents. The coordinator shall ensure that such interim measures do not constitute retaliation.
	 
	Written Report on Findings and Remedial/Corrective Action: No more than 20 business days after receiving the complaint, the coordinator shall conclude the investigation and prepare a written report of the findings. This timeline may be extended for good cause. If an extension is needed, the coordinator shall notify the parties and explain the reasons for the extension.
	
	The report shall include the decision and the reasons for the decision and shall summarize the steps taken during the investigation. If a determination has been made that discrimination or harassment occurred, the report shall also include any corrective action(s) that have been or will be taken to address the behavior, provide appropriate options for remedial actions and resolutions for the complainant, and ensure that retaliation or further discrimination or harassment is prevented. The report shall be presented to the Superintendent or designee.
	
	A summary of the findings shall be presented to the complainant and the person accused.
	 
	Appeal to the Board of Education: The complainant or the person accused may appeal any findings to the Board within 10 business days of receiving the written report of the coordinator's findings. The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board with all information presented during the investigation. Upon receiving an appeal, the Board shall schedule a hearing as soon as practicable. Any complaint against a District employee shall be addressed in closed session in accordance with law. The Board shall render its decision within 10 business days.

Other Remedies

In addition to filing a discrimination or harassment complaint with the District, a person may file a complaint with either CRD or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The time limits for filing such complaints are as follows:

	For filing a complaint with CRD alleging a violation of Government Code 12940-12952, within three years of the alleged discriminatory act(s), unless an exception exists pursuant to Government Code 12960  (Government Code 12960)
	 
	For filing a complaint with EEOC, within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act(s)  (42 USC 2000e-5)
	 
	For filing a complaint with EEOC after first filing a complaint with CRD, within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory act(s) or within 30 days after the termination of proceedings by CRD, whichever is earlier  (42 USC 2000e-5)

An employee may also file a complaint with the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor for an alleged violation of the PUMP Act and/or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for failure to provide reasonable accommodations pursuant to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.  (29 USC 218c, 218d, 42 USC 2000gg-2)

Additionally, an employee may file a complaint with the Labor Commissioner at the California Department of Industrial Relations for any alleged violation of Labor Code 1030-1034. (Labor Code 1034)
