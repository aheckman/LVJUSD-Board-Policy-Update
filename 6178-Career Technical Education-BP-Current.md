## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is for use by districts that maintain any of grades 7-12. Education Code 51220 requires that the adopted course of study for grades 7-12 include courses in career technical education (CTE); see BP/AR 6143 - Courses of Study.Funding for CTE programs may be available through the federal Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, sometimes referred to as Perkins V (20 USC 2301-2414), and state grant programs such as the California Career Pathways Trust pursuant to Education Code 53010-53016, the California Career Technical Education Incentive Grant Program pursuant to Education Code 53070-53076.4, the Golden State Pathways Program pursuant to Education Code 53020-53025, the Apprenticeship Innovation Funding Program pursuant to Labor Code 3110-3112.1, and Youth Apprenticeship pursuant to Labor Code 3120-3122.4. In addition, secondary schools may offer CTE through partnership academies (Education Code 54690-54697), regional occupational centers and programs (ROC/Ps) (Education Code 52300-52335.12), and/or district-funded programs.The following policy should be revised to reflect program(s) offered by the district and grade levels at which such programs shall be offered.
The Governing Board desires to provide a comprehensive career technical education (CTE) program in the secondary grades which integrates core academic instruction with technical and occupational instruction in order to increase student achievement, graduation rates, and readiness for postsecondary education and employment. The district's CTE program shall be designed to help students develop the academic, career, and technical skills needed to succeed in a knowledge- and skills-based economy.

The district's CTE program shall focus on preparing students to enter current or emerging high-skill, high-wage, and/or high-demand occupations by providing a rigorous academic component and practical experience in all aspects of an industry. CTE opportunities may be offered through linked learning programs, partnership academies, apprenticeship programs or orientation to apprenticeships, regional occupational centers or programs (ROC/Ps), charter schools, small learning communities, magnet programs, or other programs that expose students to career options while preparing them for future careers in a given industry or interest area.

The Superintendent or designee shall explore available funding sources that may be used to support CTE programs. The Board shall review and approve all district plans and applications for the use of district, state, and/or federal funds supporting CTE.

CSBA NOTE: State model curriculum standards for CTE for grades 7-12 integrate the state's academic content standards with industry-specific knowledge and skills in 58 career pathways organized into 15 industry sectors: agriculture and natural resources; arts, media, and entertainment; building trades and construction; education, child development, and family services; energy and utilities; engineering and design; fashion and interior design; finance and business; health science and medical technology; hospitality, tourism, and recreation; information technology; manufacturing and product development; marketing, sales, and service; public services; and transportation. The state's curriculum framework for CTE provides guidance in implementing the state content standards. Any district that adopts a course of study that meets or exceeds the state model curriculum standards will be deemed to have satisfied the requirement of Education Code 51228 that the district offer students in grades 7-12 the opportunity to attain entry-level employment skills in business or industry upon high school graduation; see BP 6143 - Courses of Study.
The Board shall adopt district standards for CTE which meet or exceed the state's model content standards and describe the essential knowledge and skills that students enrolled in these courses are expected to master.  The course curriculum shall be aligned with district-adopted standards and the state's curriculum framework.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52376, the following two paragraphs are mandated for districts that accept funds for the purpose of developing and implementing, in consultation with the ROC/P and community college serving the geographic area of the district, a CTE program for high school students.
At least every three years, the Board shall compare the district's curriculum, course content, and course sequence of CTE with the model state curriculum standards.  (Education Code 52376)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52376 requires districts to determine the extent to which their CTE courses may offer an alternative means for completing course requirements for high school graduation.Pursuant to Education Code 51225.3, as amended by AB 185 (Ch. 571, Statutes of 2022), the option to authorize the completion of a CTE course in lieu of the visual or performing arts or world language course requirement for high school graduation, which authority was deleted by AB 101 (Ch. 661, Statutes of 2021), has been restored until July 1, 2027; see BP 6146.1 - High School Graduation Requirements.
The Superintendent or designee shall systematically review the district's CTE courses to determine the degree to which each course may offer an alternative means for completing and receiving credit for specific portions of the course of study prescribed by the district for high school graduation.  CTE courses approved for these purposes shall be equivalent in content and rigor to the courses prescribed for graduation.  (Education Code 52376)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51760.1 authorizes districts, county offices of education, ROC/Ps, and partnership academies to provide work-based learning opportunities which may include, but are not limited to, work experience education as defined in Education Code 51764, community classrooms or cooperative CTE programs as defined in Education Code 52372.1, and job shadowing as defined in Education Code 51769; see BP/AR 6178.1 - Work-Based Learning. In addition, although not specified in state law, other examples of work-based learning opportunities cited in CDE's publication, "Multiple Pathways to Student Success: Envisioning the New California High School," include student internships/field study, apprenticeships, service learning, work in social/civic enterprises or school-based enterprises such as student stores, and technology-based or other simulated work experiences.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop partnerships with local businesses and industries to ensure that course sequences, career technical and integrated curriculum, classroom instruction and projects, and assessments have real-world relevance and reflect labor market needs and priorities. The Superintendent or designee shall also work to develop connections with businesses, postsecondary institutions, community organizations, and/or other employers to provide students with actual or simulated work-based learning opportunities.

The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with postsecondary institutions to ensure that the district's program is articulated with postsecondary programs in order to provide a sequential course of study. Articulation opportunities may include dual or concurrent enrollment in community college courses.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 8070 requires the Board to appoint a CTE advisory committee composed of representatives from specified groups, as detailed below. During the Federal Program Monitoring process, CDE staff will review whether the district has appointed such a committee.In addition, pursuant to 20 USC 2354 districts that receive Perkins V funding are required to involve specified stakeholders in conducting a needs assessment and developing the district application, and on a continuing basis thereafter. One way to accomplish this is to include such stakeholders on the CTE advisory committee. Other programs may have similar requirements for stakeholder involvement. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect requirements applicable to programs offered by the district.
The Board shall appoint a CTE advisory committee to develop recommendations on the district's CTE program and to serve as a liaison between the district and potential employers.  The committee shall consist of at least one student, teacher, business representative, industry representative, school administrator, member of the general public knowledgeable about the disadvantaged, and representative of the field office of the California Employment Development Department.  (Education Code 8070)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Among the criteria for admission to the University of California (UC) or California State University (CSU) system is a requirement that high school students satisfactorily complete 15 units of specified courses ("A-G" courses). These include a growing number of CTE courses that connect knowledge of academic content with practical or work-related applications. Education Code 51229 requires that districts annually provide parents/guardians of students in grades 9-12 with (1) a brief explanation of the A-G course requirements; (2) a list of UC and CSU web sites that provide related information and a list of certified A-G courses; (3) a brief description of CTE, as defined by CDE; (4) the Internet address for the portion of CDE's web site where students can learn more about CTE; and (5) information about how students may meet with school counselors to help them choose courses that will meet college admission requirements and/or to enroll in CTE courses. See AR 6143 - Courses of Study and E(1) 5145.6 - Parental Notifications.
The Superintendent or designee shall inform all secondary students and their parents/guardians about the CTE experiences available in the district, CTE courses that satisfy college admission criteria, and, if applicable, CTE courses that satisfy high school graduation requirements.  In addition, secondary students shall receive individualized academic counseling which provides information about academic and CTE opportunities related to the student's career goals.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 34 CFR 100 (Appendix B), the notice specified below may be made in local newspapers, publications or media reaching target populations, or by other means and should include a brief summary of program offerings, admission criteria, and the name and contact information of the person designated to coordinate Title IX and Section 504 compliance activity. If the population within the district contains a community of persons with limited English language skills, the notification must be disseminated in the languages of the community. See BP 5145.6 - Parental Notifications for state requirements pertaining to the translation of parental notifications.
Prior to the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall advise students, parents/guardians, employees, and the general public that all CTE opportunities are offered without regard to any actual or perceived characteristic protected from discrimination by law. The notification shall be disseminated in languages other than English as needed and shall state that the district will take steps to ensure that the lack of English language skills will not be a barrier to admission and participation in the district's CTE program.  (20 USC 2354; 34 CFR 100 Appendix B, 104.8, 106.9)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that receive funding through Perkins V for basic CTE programs pursuant to 20 USC 2301-2414. See the accompanying administrative regulation for further information regarding the participation of private school students and staff in district programs.
To the extent required by law, the Superintendent or designee shall invite the participation of private school students in CTE programs supported by federal funding under the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins).  (20 USC 2397)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Labor Code 3074.2, as added by AB 643 (Ch. 324, Statutes of 2021), districts are encouraged to provide students with opportunities to explore, make career choices, and seek appropriate instruction and training to support those choices, by hosting locally focused apprenticeship and/or career technical education fair events, such as college and career fairs.
The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with businesses, government agencies, postsecondary institutions including universities and career technical schools, community organizations, and/or other employers to provide students with actual or simulated work-based learning opportunities through college and/or career fairs.

CSBA NOTE: Labor Code 3074.2, as added by AB 643, requires any district planning to hold a college or career fair to identify approved apprenticeship programs in the county and notify such programs that they are hosting a college or career fair.  To identify approved programs the district is required to rely on the Division of Apprenticeship Standards' database of approved apprenticeship programs, located on its web site.
When planning to hold a college or career fair, the Superintendent or designee shall notify each apprenticeship program in the county.  The notification shall include the planned date, time and location of the college or career fair.  (Labor Code 3074.2)

CSBA NOTE: Teachers of technical, trade, or vocational courses must possess a single subject credential or a designated subjects credential issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing which authorizes teaching CTE courses. The designated subjects CTE credential is available in 15 subjects which reflect the 15 industry sectors identified in the state's model curriculum standards; see AR 4112.2 - Certification. In order to obtain the preliminary designated subjects credential, teachers must have at least three years of work experience directly related to each industry sector specified on the credential.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that teachers of CTE courses possess the qualifications and credentials necessary to teach their assigned courses. The Superintendent or designee shall also provide teachers and administrators with professional development designed to enhance their knowledge of standards-aligned CTE and shall provide opportunities for CTE teachers to collaborate with teachers of academic courses in the development and implementation of integrated curriculum models.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide counselors and other guidance personnel with professional development that includes, but is not limited to, information about current workforce needs and trends, requirements of the district's CTE program, work-based learning opportunities, and postsecondary education and employment options following high school.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Education Code 17078.72 provides funding for improving and expanding CTE programs through construction of new facilities, remodeling of existing facilities, and/or purchase of equipment.
The Superintendent or designee shall regularly assess district needs for facilities, technologies, and equipment to increase students' access to the district's CTE program.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect requirements applicable to programs offered by the district. Pursuant to Education Code 52060, the district must annually review its progress toward the goals identified in its local control and accountability plan, including, when applicable, measures of student achievement such as the percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for CTE sequences or programs of study that align with state CTE standards and frameworks. The California School Dashboard provides a tool to assist in evaluation of district and school performance and includes measures of CTE pathway completion within the college/career readiness indicator.In addition, each district receiving Perkins V funding must evaluate its progress in achieving specific performance levels on core indicators as detailed in the state plan and 20 USC 2323. Pursuant to 20 USC 2343, if the district falls below 90 percent on any of these targets, the district will be required to develop and implement an improvement plan.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board achievement data on participating students, including, but not limited to, the percentage of participating students who successfully complete CTE programs, their performance on state and district academic achievement tests, and graduation rates. Data shall be disaggregated by program and various student subgroups. Based on such data, the Board shall determine the need for program improvements and update the goals in the district's local control and accountability plan as necessary.
