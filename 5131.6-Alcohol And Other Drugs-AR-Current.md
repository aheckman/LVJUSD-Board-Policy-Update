Instruction

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51203 mandates the Governing Board to adopt regulations specifying the grade(s) and course(s) in which drug education is given. The following paragraphs may be revised to specify Board-designated grades and courses.
The curriculum of all elementary and secondary schools shall include instruction on the effects upon the human body, as determined by science, of tobacco, alcohol, narcotics, dangerous drugs as defined in Health and Safety Code 11032, and other dangerous substances. Instruction shall be sequential in nature and suited to meet the needs of students at their respective grade level.  (Education Code 51203, 51260)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education 51203, as amended by AB 2865 (Ch. 314, Statutes of 2024), instruction on the nature and effects of alcohol is required to include information about excessive alcohol use and the short- and long-term health risks of excessive alcohol use, which may include instruction about depression and anxiety.
Instruction on the nature and effects of alcohol shall include information about excessive alcohol use and the short- and long-term health risks of excessive alcohol use, including information about excessive drinking, the immediate effects of alcohol that increase the risks of harmful health conditions, and how excessive alcohol use can lead to the development of chronic diseases and other serious problems, including alcohol-related deaths and mental health problems.  (Education Code 51203)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51260 provides that instruction on drug education "should" be conducted in conjunction with courses given on health to students in grades 1-6 and "shall" be conducted in conjunction with courses given on health to students in grades 7-12. Given this distinction, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education or district counsel regarding drug education in grades 1-6.
In grades 1-6, instruction in drug education should be given in health courses required by Education Code 51210.  (Education Code 51260)

In grades 7-12, instruction in drug education shall be conducted in health courses and in any other appropriate area of study required by Education Code 51220.  (Education Code 51260)

Secondary school instruction shall also include a study of the effects of alcohol and other drugs upon prenatal development.  (Education Code 51203)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for districts that require students to complete a course in health education for graduation from high school. Pursuant to Education Code 51225.38, as added by AB 2429 (Ch. 67, Statutes of 2024), beginning with the 2026-27 school year, if a district has elected to require students to complete a course in health education for graduation from high school, such course is required to include instruction in the dangers associated with fentanyl use.
Additionally, beginning with the 2026-27 school year, courses in health education required for graduation from high school shall include instruction in the dangers associated with fentanyl use in accordance with Education Code 51225.38.

Instruction shall be provided by appropriately trained instructors who have demonstrated competencies, as determined by the principal or designee, in the following areas:  (Education Code 51260)

	The ability to interact with students in a positive way
	 
	Knowledge of the properties and effects of tobacco, alcohol, narcotics, dangerous drugs, and shared drug apparatus
	 
	Effective teaching skills and competency in helping students to express opinions responsibly and to become aware of their values as they affect drug-use decisions

Intervention

District staff shall intervene whenever students use alcohol or other illegal drugs while on school property or under school jurisdiction. Staff members who have a reasonable suspicion that a student may be under the influence of alcohol or drugs shall immediately notify the principal or designee.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44049 authorizes the principal or designee to report a known or suspected instance of student alcohol- or drug-use to the student's parent/guardian, except when such a report would involve a disclosure of confidential information acquired during counseling in violation of Education Code 49602 and as specified below. The principal or designee incurs no criminal or civil liability as a result of this report, unless a false report was made knowingly or with reckless disregard for truth or falsity.
If the principal or designee, observes or suspects that a student may be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the principal or designee may notify the student's parent/guardian.  (Education Code 44049)

School staff shall not disclose confidential information provided during counseling by a student 12 years of age or older. A school counselor may report such information to the principal or parent/guardian only when the counselor believes that disclosure is necessary to avert a clear and present danger to the health, safety or welfare of the student or other persons living in the school community. The school counselor shall not disclose such information to the parent/guardian if the counselor believes that the disclosure would result in a clear and present danger to the student's health, safety or welfare.  (Education Code 44049, 49602)
