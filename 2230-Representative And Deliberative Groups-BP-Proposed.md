## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that broad input on District operations and policy from staff, parents/guardians, students and members of the public can provide the District with a diversity of viewpoints and expertise, help build a sense of ownership of the schools, enhance District efficiency and assist District communications.  As desired, the Superintendent or designee may establish a management team, administrative councils, task forces, cabinets or committees in accordance with law.

The membership, composition and responsibilities of these groups shall be defined by the Superintendent or designee. The Superintendent or designee may establish, change or dissolve these groups at his/her discretion.

Groups established by the Superintendent or designee shall act in an advisory capacity unless specifically authorized to act on behalf of the Superintendent or designee. Advisory groups shall submit their recommendations to the Superintendent or designee, who may report the recommendations to the Board as appropriate.

Expenses incurred for consulting services, materials, travel or other related operations shall be approved by the Superintendent or designee in advance.
