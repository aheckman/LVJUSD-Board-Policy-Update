## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following mandated administrative regulation and accompanying Board policy address student records, which are governed by both federal and state law, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 USC 1232g, 34 CFR 99.1-99.8), the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) (20 USC 1232h), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) (15 USC 6501-6506, 16 CFR 312), Education Code 49069.7 and 49073.1, K-12 Pupil Online Personal Information Protection Act (Business and Professions Code 22584), Early Learning Personal Information Protection Act (Business and Professions Code 22586), and 5 CCR 430-438. For information regarding public access to certain records in accordance with the California Public Records Act (CPRA) (Government Code 7920.000 - 7930.215), see BP/AR 1340 - Access to District Records and BB 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications. For information regarding retention of records, see BP/AR 3580 - District Records and AR 4112.6/4212.6/4312.6 - Personnel Files.Pursuant to 5 CCR 431, districts are mandated to establish policies and procedures to implement state law and regulations regarding student records, including policies and procedures which (1) enumerate and describe the student records collected and maintained by the district, (2) ensure security of the records, and (3) guarantee access to authorized persons within five days of a request. Education Code 49069.7 mandates procedures related to parental review of student records. The following administrative regulation includes language implementing these mandates.Pursuant to Education Code 234.7, districts were mandated to adopt policies with language that is equivalent to the model policy language developed by the California Attorney General in "Promoting a Safe and Secure Learning Environment for All: Guidance and Model Policies to Assist California's K-12 Schools in Responding to Immigration Issues," first published in April 2018 ("2018 Guidance"), by June 1, 2018. The Attorney General updated the 2018 Guidance in December 2024 ("2024 Guidance") and has stated that districts "should" adopt or update their policies based on the 2024 Guidance by May 1, 2025. The 2024 Guidance is available on the Office of the Attorney General's website and includes model policy language regarding student records.
Definitions

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49063 requires districts to include the criteria for defining "legitimate educational interest" and "school officials and employees" in their annual notification; see "Notification of Parents/Guardians", below.
Legitimate educational interest is an interest held by any school official, employee, contractor, or consultant whose official duties, responsibilities, or contractual obligations to the district, whether routine or as a result of special circumstances, require access to information contained in student records.

Mandatory interim student records are those records which the schools are directed to compile and maintain for specified periods of time and are then destroyed in accordance with state law, regulation, or administrative directive.  (5 CCR 430)

Mandatory permanent student records are those records which are maintained in perpetuity and which schools have been directed to compile by state law, regulation, or administrative directive.  (5 CCR 430)

Parent/guardian means a natural parent, an adopted parent, legal guardian, surrogate parent, or foster parent.  (Education Code 49061, 56050, 56055)

Personally identifiable information includes, but is not limited to:  (34 CFR 99.3)


	The student's name
	 
	The name of the student's parent/guardian or other family members
	 
	The address of the student or student's family
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 34 CFR 99.3, the definition of "personally identifiable information" includes a personal identifier such as a student's social security number. Education Code 49076.7 prohibits districts from collecting or soliciting social security numbers, or the last four digits of social security numbers, from students or their parents/guardians unless otherwise required to do so by state or federal law. If a social security number is collected under such circumstances, it must be classified as personally identifiable information and is subject to the restrictions related to access or de-identification of records specified in 34 CFR 99.30-99.39 and this administrative regulation.
	A personal identifier, such as the student's social security number, student number, or biometric record (e.g., fingerprints, retina and iris patterns, voiceprints, DNA sequence, facial characteristics, and handwriting)
	 
	Other indirect identifiers, such as the student's date of birth, place of birth, and mother's maiden name
	 
	Other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty
	 
	Information requested by a person who the district reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the student record relates

CSBA NOTE: 34 CFR 99.31 defines "school officials and employees" for purposes of determining who may be given personally identifiable information from student records, as provided below. In 73 Fed. Reg. 74815 (2008), the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) stated that local agencies are in the best position to determine the types of parties who may serve as school officials. Examples cited include school transportation officials (including bus drivers), school nurses, practicum and fieldwork students, unpaid interns, consultants, contractors, volunteers, and other outside parties providing institutional services and performing institutional functions, provided that each of the requirements in 34 CFR 99.31 has been met.
School officials and employees are officials or employees, including teachers, whose duties and responsibilities to the district, whether routine or as a result of special circumstances, require access to student records.  (34 CFR 99.31)

Student means any individual who is or has been in attendance at the district and regarding whom the district maintains student records.  (34 CFR 99.3)

CSBA NOTE: USDOE and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services', "Joint Guidance on the Application of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to Student Health Records," clarifies that a student's immunization and health record maintained by the district is a "student record" subject to FERPA.
Student records are any items of information (in handwriting, print, tape, film, computer, or other medium) gathered within or outside the district that are directly related to an identifiable student and maintained by the district, required to be maintained by an employee in the performance of the employee's duties, or maintained by a party acting for the district. Any information maintained for the purpose of second-party review is considered a student record. Student records include the student's health record.  (Education Code 49061, 49062; 5 CCR 430; 34 CFR 99.3)

Student records do not include:  (Education Code 49061, 49062; 34 CFR 99.3)

	Directory information
	 
	Informal notes compiled by a school officer or employee which remain in the sole possession of the maker, are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any other person except a substitute employee
	
	CSBA NOTE: USDOE guidance, "School Resource Officers, School Law Enforcement Units, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)," clarifies that records created by the district's law enforcement unit, such as student images appearing on security videotapes, are not considered student records under FERPA as long as the records are created for a law enforcement purpose.
	Records of the law enforcement unit of the district, as specified in 34 CFR 99.8
	 
	Records created or received by the district after an individual is no longer a student and that are not directly related to the individual's attendance as a student
	 
	Grades on peer-graded papers before they are collected and recorded by a teacher

Persons Granted Absolute Access

In accordance with law, absolute access to any student records shall be granted to:

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Family Code 6323.5, districts are required to develop protocols to comply with a court's restraining order that prohibits a party from accessing records and information pertaining to the education, daycare, health care, recreational activities, or employment of a minor child of the parties, which may include a parent/guardian who would otherwise be entitled to the records. For additional information see the accompanying Board policy.


	Parents/guardians of students younger than age 18 years, including the parent who is not the student's custodial parent  (Education Code 49069.7; Family Code 3025)
	
	However, the district shall not disclose student records to a party, including a parent/guardian, who is legally prohibited from accessing records and information of a student pursuant to a restraining order.  (Family Code 6323.5)
	 
	An adult student, or a student under the age of 18 years who attends a postsecondary institution, in which case the student alone shall exercise rights related to the student's records and grant consent for the release of records  (34 CFR 99.3, 99.5)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 56041.5, all the rights accorded to the parent/guardian of a student with exceptional needs, including the right to access student records, are transferred to the student at 18 years of age, except when the student has been declared incompetent under state law.

Access for Limited Purpose/Legitimate Educational Interest

The following persons or agencies shall have access to those particular records that are relevant to their legitimate educational interest or other legally authorized purpose:

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49076 and 34 CFR 99.31 require that access to relevant records be given to parents/guardians of a dependent child, defined by 26 USC 152 as one who lives with a parent/guardian for more than half the taxable year, meets the specified age requirements, has not provided more than half of one's own support during that year, and has not filed a joint tax return with a spouse.


	Parents/guardians of a student 18 years of age or older who is a dependent child as defined in 26 USC 152  (Education Code 49076; 34 CFR 99.31)
	 
	Students who are age 16 or older or who have completed the 10th grade  (Education Code 49076)

	Officials and employees of other public schools, school systems, or postsecondary institutions where the student intends or is directed to enroll, including local, county, or state correctional facilities where educational programs leading to high school graduation are provided, or where the student is already enrolled, as long as the disclosure is for purposes related to the student's enrollment or transfer  (Education Code 49076; 34 CFR 99.31)


CSBA NOTE: 34 CFR 99.34 requires the district to make a reasonable attempt to notify the parent/guardian or adult student when the district discloses certain information as described in the following paragraph. However, if the district includes a statement in its annual parental notification that the district may forward education records under such circumstances, it is not obligated to individually notify parents/guardians or adult students. The following optional paragraph may be deleted by districts that include such a statement in their annual parental notification. See "Notification of Parents/Guardians," below.
Unless the annual parent/guardian notification issued pursuant to Education Code 48980 includes a statement that the district may disclose students' personally identifiable information to officials of another school, school system, or postsecondary institution where the student seeks or intends to enroll, the Superintendent or designee shall, when such a disclosure is made, make a reasonable attempt to notify the parent/guardian or adult student at the last known address, provide a copy of the record that is disclosed, and give the parent/guardian or adult student an opportunity for a hearing to challenge the record.  (34 CFR 99.34)

CSBA NOTE: Item #6 is for use by districts that maintain high schools. Education Code 69432.9 provides that all students in grade 12 will be considered Cal Grant applicants and will have their grade point average (GPA) submitted to the Student Aid Commission, unless they opt out or are permitted under Commission rules to submit test scores in lieu of the GPA. Education Code 69432.9 requires that the report be submitted on a standardized form provided by the Commission. Pursuant to Education Code 69432.92, the Commission may also require that districts submit verification of high school graduation or its equivalent for all students who graduated in the prior academic year, except for students who have opted out.Education Code 69432.9 requires that parents/guardians be notified that their child's GPA will be forwarded, unless they opt out within the time period specified in the notice. This notification may be included in the annual parental notification issued pursuant to Education Code 48980.Pursuant to Education Code 69475, portions of the existing Cal Grant Program will be conditionally repealed upon the Legislature's implementation of the Cal Grant Reform Act. AB 107 (Ch. 22, Statutes of 2024) announced the Legislature's intent to "phase in" the Cal Grant Reform Act beginning in 2025-26. As such, the existing Cal Grant Program remains in effect, but it is recommended that districts with questions about the Cal Grant Reform Act's effect on the existing Cal Grant Program consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.


	The Student Aid Commission, to provide the grade point average (GPA) of all district students in grade 12 and, when required, verification of high school graduation or its equivalent of all students who graduated in the prior academic year, for use in the Cal Grant postsecondary financial aid program
	
	However, such information shall not be submitted when students opt out or are permitted by the rules of the Student Aid Commission to provide test scores in lieu of the GPA.  (Education Code 69432.9, 69432.92)
	
	No later than January 1 each year, the Superintendent or designee shall notify each student in grade 11, and the student's parents/guardians if the student is under age 18 years, that the student's GPA will be forwarded to the Student Aid Commission by October 1, unless the student opts out within a period of time specified in the notice, which shall not be less than 30 days.  (Education Code 69432.9)
	
	Students' social security numbers shall not be included in the submitted information unless the Student Aid Commission deems it necessary to complete the financial aid application and the Superintendent or designee obtains permission from the student's parent/guardian, or from the adult student, to submit the social security number.  (Education Code 69432.9)

Any person, agency, or organization granted access is prohibited from releasing information to another person, agency, or organization without written permission from the parent/guardian or adult student unless specifically allowed by state law or FERPA.  (Education Code 49076; 20 USC 1232g; 34 CFR 99.1-99.8)

De-identification of Records

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 1232g and Education Code 49076 authorize the district to release student records for specified purposes without parent/guardian consent after the removal of all "personally identifiable information," as defined in "Definitions" above, and provided that the district has made a reasonable determination that a student's identity will not be personally identifiable through single or multiple releases. Education Code 49074 further authorizes the district to provide de-identified statistical data to public or private agencies, postsecondary institutions, or educational research organizations when such actions would be "in the best educational interests of students."34 CFR 99.31 lists objective standards under which districts may release information from de-identified records. These standards are applicable to both requests for individual, redacted records and requests for statistical information from multiple records.
When authorized by law for any program audit, educational research, or other purpose, the Superintendent or designee may release information from a student record without prior consent of the parent/guardian or adult student after the removal of all personally identifiable information. Prior to releasing such information, the Superintendent or designee shall make a reasonable determination that the student's identity is not personally identifiable, whether through single or multiple releases and taking into account other reasonably available information.  (Education Code 49074, 49076; 20 USC 1232g; 34 CFR 99.31)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49069.7 mandates procedures for notifying parents/guardians of the location of student records if not centrally located. The following paragraph may be expanded to include notification procedures.
Student records shall be maintained in a central file at the school attended by the student or, when records are maintained at different locations, a notation shall be placed in the central file indicating where other records may be found. Parents/guardians and adult students shall be notified of the location of student records if not centrally located.  (Education Code 49069.7; 5 CCR 433)

The custodian of records shall be responsible for the security of student records and shall ensure that access is limited to authorized persons.  (5 CCR 433)

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 431 mandates districts to establish written procedures to ensure the security of student records, including (1) guaranteeing access to authorized persons within five business days following the date of request, (2) assuring security of the records, and (3) enumerating and describing the student records collected and maintained by the district. The following three paragraphs reflect this mandate and should be modified to reflect any specific physical, technological, or administrative controls developed by the district. The types of student records collected and maintained by the district are enumerated and described in "Retention and Destruction of Student Records," below.34 CFR 99.31 requires districts to use "reasonable methods" to (1) ensure that school officials, employees, and outside contractors obtain access to only those records, both paper and electronic, in which they have a legitimate educational interest and (2) identify and authenticate the identity of parents/guardians, students, school officials, and any other party to whom the district discloses personally identifiable information from education records. In addition, 34 CFR 99.31 specifies that a district that does not use physical or technological access controls, such as a locked file cabinet or computer security limiting access, must ensure that its administrative policy for controlling access is effective and remains in compliance with the "legitimate educational interest" requirement.In commentary accompanying the Final Rule (73 Fed.Reg. 237, page 74817), USDOE suggests a balance of physical, technological, and administrative controls to prevent unauthorized access and to ensure that school officials do not have unrestricted access to the records of all students. The Analysis also clarifies that the reasonableness of the method depends, in part, on the potential harm involved. For example, high-risk records, such as social security numbers or other information that could be used for identity theft, should receive greater and more immediate protection.In addition, as a condition of participation in an interagency data information system, such as the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS), Education Code 49076 requires that the district develop security procedures or devices by which unauthorized personnel cannot access data in the system and procedures or devices to secure privileged or confidential data from unauthorized disclosure.
The custodian of records shall develop reasonable methods, including physical, technological, and administrative policy controls, to ensure that school officials and employees obtain access to only those student records in which they have legitimate educational interests.  (Education Code 49076; 5 CCR 431; 34 CFR 99.31)

To inspect, review, or obtain copies of student records, authorized persons shall submit a request to the custodian of records. Prior to granting the request, the custodian of records shall authenticate the individual's identity. For any individual granted access based on a legitimate educational interest, the request shall specify the interest involved.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49069.7 and 5 CCR 431 mandate that the district adopt procedures for granting parent/guardian requests to inspect, review, and obtain copies of records.
Within five business days following the date of request, the authorized person shall be granted access to inspect, review, and obtain copies of student records during regular school hours.  (Education Code 49069.7; 5 CCR 431)

CSBA NOTE: 34 CFR 99.30 specifies information that is required be included in the parent/guardian consent form, as provided below.
When required by law, a student's parent/guardian or an adult student shall provide written, signed, and dated consent before the district discloses the student record. Such consent may be given through electronic means in those cases where it can be authenticated. The district's consent form shall specify the records that may be disclosed, state the purpose of the disclosure, and identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made. Upon request by the parent/guardian or adult student, the district shall provide a copy of the records disclosed.  (34 CFR 99.30)

If the parent/guardian or adult student refuses to provide written consent for the release of student information, the Superintendent or designee shall not release the information, unless it is otherwise subject to release based on a court order or a lawful subpoena.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49069.7 mandates procedures for the availability of qualified certificated personnel to interpret records when requested. The following paragraph may be expanded to include specific procedures for persons to request and receive the assistance of certificated personnel.
Qualified certificated personnel shall be available to interpret records when requested.  (Education Code 49069.7)

The custodian of records or the Superintendent or designee shall prevent the alteration, damage, or loss of records during inspection.  (5 CCR 435)

Access Log

A log shall be maintained for each student's record which lists all persons, agencies, or organizations requesting or receiving information from the record and the legitimate educational interest of the requester.  (Education Code 49064)

In every instance of inspection by persons who do not have assigned educational responsibility, the custodian of records shall make an entry in the log indicating the record inspected, the name of the person granted access, the reason access was granted, and the time and circumstances of inspection.  (5 CCR 435)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The custodian of records shall also make an entry in the log regarding any request for record(s) that was denied and the reason for the denial.

CSBA NOTE: Although Education Code 49064 does not require the district to record access by individuals specified in Items #1-5 below, the district may consider recording access by all individuals as part of the reasonable administrative controls required by 34 CFR 99.31; see "Process for Providing Access to Records," above.
The log shall include requests for access to records by:

	Parents/guardians or adult students
	 
	Students who are 16 years of age or older or who have completed the 10th grade
	 
	Parties obtaining district-approved directory information
	 
	Parties who provide written parental consent, in which case the consent notice shall be filed with the record pursuant to Education Code 49075
	 
	School officials and employees who have a legitimate educational interest
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 234.7, any request for student information by a law enforcement agency for the purpose of enforcing immigration laws must be reported to the Superintendent and the Governing Board; see the accompanying Board policy. Therefore, it is recommended that the custodian of records make an entry in the log regarding any such requests, as provided in Item #6 below.
	Law enforcement personnel seeking immigration-related information

The log shall be open to inspection only by the parent/guardian, adult student, dependent adult student, custodian of records, and certain state or federal officials specified in Education Code 49064.  (Education Code 49064; 5 CCR 432)

Duplication of Student Records

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49069.7 mandates that the district adopt procedures for granting parent/guardian requests for copies of student records pursuant to Education Code 49065.
To provide copies of any student record, the district may charge a reasonable fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing the copies. No charge shall be made for providing up to two transcripts or up to two verifications of various records for any former student. No charge shall be made to locate or retrieve any student record.  (Education Code 49065)

Changes to Student Records

Only a parent/guardian having legal custody of a student or a student who is 18 years of age or is attending an institution of postsecondary education may challenge the content of a record or offer a written response to a record.  (Education Code 49061)

No addition or change shall be made to a student's record after high school graduation or permanent departure, other than routine updating, unless required by law or with prior consent of the parent/guardian or adult student.  (Education Code 49070; 5 CCR 437)

CSBA NOTE: In CALPADS', "Update FLASH #158, Guidance for Changing a Student's Legal Name in CALPADS," CDE states that a request to change a student's legal name must be supported by legal documentation such as a court record, birth certificate, or passport.Pursuant to Education Code 220.3, as added by AB 1955 (Ch. 95, Statutes of 2024), a district is prohibited from requiring an employee or contractor to disclose any information related to a student's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, including changing student records, to any other person without the student's consent unless otherwise required by state or federal law.
Any request to change a student's legal name in the student's mandatory permanent student record shall be accompanied with appropriate documentation.

Any challenge to the content of a student's record shall be filed in accordance with Education Code 49070 and the process specified in Administrative Regulation 5125.3 - Challenging Student Records.

Retention and Destruction of Student Records

All anecdotal information and assessment reports maintained as student records shall be dated and signed by the individual who originated the data.  (5 CCR 431)

The following mandatory permanent student records shall be kept indefinitely:  (5 CCR 432, 437)

	Legal name of student
	 
	Date and place of birth and method of verifying birth date
	 
	Sex of student

	Date of high school graduation or equivalent

Mandatory interim student records, unless forwarded to another district, shall be maintained subject to destruction during the third school year after the school year in which they originated, following a determination that their usefulness has ceased or the student has left the district. These records include:  (Education Code 48918, 51747; 5 CCR 432, 437, 16027)


	Expulsion orders and the causes therefor
	 
	A log identifying persons or organizations who request or receive information from the student record

	Written findings resulting from an evaluation conducted after a specified number of missed assignments to determine whether it is in a student's best interest to remain in independent study

Permitted student records may be destroyed six months after the student completes or withdraws from the educational program and their usefulness ceases, including:  (5 CCR 432, 437)


	Objective counselor and/or teacher ratings
	 
	Standardized test results older than three years
	 
	Routine discipline data
	 
	Verified reports of relevant behavioral patterns
	 
	All disciplinary notices
	 
	Supplementary attendance records

Records shall be destroyed in a way that assures they will not be available to possible public inspection in the process of destruction.  (5 CCR 437)

Transfer of Student Records

When a student transfers into this district from any other school district or a private school, the Superintendent or designee shall inform the student's parent/guardian of rights regarding student records, including a parent/guardian's right to review, challenge, and receive a copy of student records.  (Education Code 49068; 5 CCR 438)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48201 requires districts to request records of a transferring student regarding acts that resulted in the student's suspension or expulsion from the previous school, as specified below. Once the record is received, the Superintendent or designee must inform the student's teachers of the acts; see AR 4158/4258/4358 - Employee Security.
When a student transfers into this district from another district, the Superintendent or designee shall request that the student's previous district provide any records, either maintained by that district in the ordinary course of business or received from a law enforcement agency, regarding acts committed by the transferring student that resulted in the student's suspension or expulsion.  (Education Code 48201)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49068, a district is required to transfer a copy of a student's records to another school in which the student is enrolled or intends to enroll within 10 school days of receiving a request for the records. However, this is not applicable in circumstances where a more restrictive timeline is required. For example, a district is required to transfer the records of a student who is a foster youth to the new school within two business days, pursuant to Education Code 48853.5.
When a student transfers from this district to another school district or to a private school, the Superintendent or designee shall forward a copy of the student's mandatory permanent record within 10 school days of the district's receipt of the request for the student's records. The original record or a copy shall be retained permanently by this district. If the transfer is to another California public school, the student's entire mandatory interim record shall also be forwarded. If the transfer is out of state or to a private school, the mandatory interim record may be forwarded. Permitted student records may be forwarded to any other district or private school.  (Education Code 48918, 49068; 5 CCR 438)

Upon receiving a request from a county placing agency to transfer a student in foster care out of a district school, the Superintendent or designee shall transfer the student's records to the next educational placement within two business days.  (Education Code 49069.5)

Additionally, when a student in foster care is enrolling in a district school, the district's liaison for foster youth shall contact, within two business days of the student's request for enrollment, the school last attended by the student to obtain all academic and other records.  (Education Code 48853.5)

All student records shall be updated before they are transferred.  (5 CCR 438)

Student records shall not be withheld from the requesting district because of any charges or fees owed by the student or parent/guardian.  (5 CCR 438)

If the district is withholding grades, diploma, or transcripts from the student because of damage or loss of school property, this information shall be sent to the requesting district along with the student's records.

Notification of Parents/Guardians

Upon any student's initial enrollment, and at the beginning of each school year thereafter, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians and eligible students, in writing, of their rights related to student records. If 15 percent or more of the students enrolled in the district speak a single primary language other than English, then the district shall provide these notices in that language. Otherwise, the district shall provide these notices in the student's home language insofar as practicable. The district shall effectively notify parents/guardians or eligible students with exceptional needs.  (Education Code 48985, 49063; 5 CCR 431; 34 CFR 99.7)

The notice shall include:  (Education Code 49063, 60900.5; 34 CFR 99.7, 99.34)

	The types of student records kept by the district and the information contained therein
	 
	The title(s) of the official(s) responsible for maintaining each type of record
	 
	The location of the log identifying those who request information from the records
	 
	District criteria for defining school officials and employees and for determining legitimate educational interest
	 
	District policies for reviewing and expunging student records
	 
	The right to inspect and review student records and the procedures for doing so

	The cost, if any, charged for duplicating copies of records
	 
	The categories of information defined as directory information pursuant to Education Code 49073
	 
	The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's records except when disclosure without consent is authorized by law
	 
	Availability of the curriculum prospectus developed pursuant to Education Code 49091.14 containing the titles, descriptions, and instructional aims of every course offered by the school
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #12 is for districts that serve students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code 60900, as amended by SB 153, districts are required to annually notify parents/guardians that specified district data and data collected by CDE is shared with CCGI.
	The sharing with CCGI of specified district data and data collected by the California Department of Education for the purposes of college admissions, academic placement, and eligibility for student financial aid  (Education Code 60900)
	 
	Any other rights and requirements set forth in Education Code 49060-49085, and the right of parents/guardians to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning an alleged failure by the district to comply with 20 USC 1232g
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 34 CFR 99.34, if the district's annual parental notification contains the information described in optional Item #14 below, the district does not need to attempt to individually notify a parent/guardian or adult student when the district discloses an education record to officials of another school, school system, or postsecondary institution; see Item #5 in the list of persons/agencies with legitimate educational interests in "Access for Limited Purpose/Legitimate Educational Interest," above.
	A statement that the district forwards education records to other agencies or institutions that request the records and in which the student seeks or intends to enroll or is already enrolled as long as the disclosure is for purposes related to the student's enrollment

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph reflects model policy language from the 2024 Guidance developed pursuant to Education Code 234.7.
In addition, the annual parental notification shall include a statement that a student's citizenship status, immigration status, place of birth, or any other information indicating national origin will not be released without parental consent or a court order.

Student Records from Social Media

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that have adopted a program, pursuant to Education Code 49073.6, to gather or maintain any information obtained from students' social media activity that pertains directly to school safety or student safety. Districts that adopt such a program, as specified in the accompanying Board policy, must comply with the requirements described below. Districts that have not adopted such a program should delete the following section.
For the purpose of gathering and maintaining records of students' social media activity, the Superintendent or designee shall:  (Education Code 49073.6)

	Gather or maintain only information that pertains directly to school safety or student safety
	 
	Provide a student with access to any information that the district obtained from the student's social media activity and an opportunity to correct or delete such information
	 
	Destroy information gathered from social media and maintained in student records within one year after a student turns 18 years of age or within one year after the student is no longer enrolled in the district, whichever occurs first
	 
	Notify each parent/guardian that the student's information is being gathered from social media and that any information maintained in the student's records shall be destroyed as provided in Item #3 above
	
	The notification shall also include, but is not limited to, an explanation of the process by which a student or the student's parent/guardian may access the student's records for examination of the information gathered or maintained and the process by which removal of the information may be requested or corrections to the information may be made. The notification may be provided as part of the annual parental notification required pursuant to Education Code 48980.
	 
	If the district contracts with a third party to gather information on a student from social media, ensure that the contract:
	 
	
		Prohibits the third party from using the information for purposes other than those specified in the contract or from selling or sharing the information with any person or entity other than the district, the student, or the student's parent/guardian
		 
		Requires the third party to destroy the information immediately upon satisfying the terms of the contract, or when the district notifies the third party that the student has turned 18 years of age or is no longer enrolled in the district, whichever occurs first
	
	

Updating Name and/or Gender of Former Students

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49062.5 requires a district to update a former student's records to reflect a change to the former student's name and/or gender, as specified below.
When a former student submits a state-issued driver's license, birth certificate, passport, social security card, court order, or other government-issued documentation demonstrating that the former student's legal name and/or gender has changed, the district shall update the former student's records to include the updated legal name and/or gender. Upon request by the former student, the district shall reissue any documents conferred upon the former student, including, but not limited to, a transcript, a high school diploma, a high school equivalency certificate, or other similar documents.  (Education Code 49062.5)

If the former student's name or gender is changed and the requested records are reissued, a new document shall be added to the former student's file that includes all of the following information:  (Education Code 49062.5)

	The date of the request
	 
	The date the requested records were reissued to the former student

The following three paragraphs reflect this mandate and should be modified to reflect any specific physical, technological, or administrative controls developed by the district.

In addition, 34 CFR 99.31 specifies that a district that does not use physical or technological access controls, such as a locked file cabinet or computer security limiting access, must ensure that its administrative policy for controlling access is effective and remains in compliance with the "legitimate educational interest" requirement.<br><br>In commentary accompanying the Final Rule (73 Fed.Reg. 237, page 74817), USDOE suggests a balance of physical, technological, and administrative controls to prevent unauthorized access and to ensure that school officials do not have unrestricted access to the records of all students. The Analysis also clarifies that the reasonableness of the method depends, in part, on the potential harm involved. For example, high-risk records, such as social security numbers or other information that could be used for identity theft, should receive greater and more immediate protection.<br><br>In addition, as a condition of participation in an interagency data information system, such as the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS), Education Code 49076 requires that the district develop security procedures or devices by which unauthorized personnel cannot access data in the system and procedures or devices to secure privileged or confidential data from unauthorized disclosure.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="ENzENw18" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22ENzENw18%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22IOQ164%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1741906969%2C%22text%22%3A%225%20CCR%20431%20mandates%20districts%20to%20establish%20written%20procedures%20to%20ensure%20the%20security%20of%20student%20records%2C%20including%20%281%29%20guaranteeing%20access%20to%20authorized%20persons%20within%20five%20business%20days%20following%20the%20date%20of%20request%2C%20%282%29%20assuring%20security%20of%20the%20records%2C%20and%20%283%29%20enumerating%20and%20describing%20the%20student%20records%20collected%20and%20maintained%20by%20the%20district.%20The%20following%20three%20paragraphs%20reflect%20this%20mandate%20and%20should%20be%20modified%20to%20reflect%20any%20specific%20physical%2C%20technological%2C%20or%20administrative%20controls%20developed%20by%20the%20district.%20The%20types%20of%20student%20records%20collected%20and%20maintained%20by%20the%20district%20are%20enumerated%20and%20described%20in%20%5C%22Retention%20and%20Destruction%20of%20Student%20Records%2C%5C%22%20below.%5Cn%5Cn34%20CFR%2099.31%20requires%20districts%20to%20use%20%5C%22reasonable%20methods%5C%22%20to%20%281%29%20ensure%20that%20school%20officials%2C%20employees%2C%20and%20outside%20contractors%20obtain%20access%20to%20only%20those%20records%2C%20both%20paper%20and%20electronic%2C%20in%20which%20they%20have%20a%20legitimate%20educational%20interest%20and%20%282%29%20identify%20and%20authenticate%20the%20identity%20of%20parents/guardians%2C%20students%2C%20school%20officials%2C%20and%20any%20other%20party%20to%20whom%20the%20district%20discloses%20personally%20identifiable%20information%20from%20education%20records.%20In%20addition%2C%2034%20CFR%2099.31%20specifies%20that%20a%20district%20that%20does%20not%20use%20physical%20or%20technological%20access%20controls%2C%20such%20as%20a%20locked%20file%20cabinet%20or%20computer%20security%20limiting%20access%2C%20must%20ensure%20that%20its%20administrative%20policy%20for%20controlling%20access%20is%20effective%20and%20remains%20in%20compliance%20with%20the%20%5C%22legitimate%20educational%20interest%5C%22%20requirement.%5Cn%5CnIn%20commentary%20accompanying%20the%20Final%20Rule%20%2873%20Fed.Reg.%20237%2C%20page%2074817%29%2C%20USDOE%20suggests%20a%20balance%20of%20physical%2C%20technological%2C%20and%20administrative%20controls%20to%20prevent%20unauthorized%20access%20and%20to%20ensure%20that%20school%20officials%20do%20not%20have%20unrestricted%20access%20to%20the%20records%20of%20all%20students.%20The%20Analysis%20also%20clarifies%20that%20the%20reasonableness%20of%20the%20method%20depends%2C%20in%20part%2C%20on%20the%20potential%20harm%20involved.%20For%20example%2C%20high-risk%20records%2C%20such%20as%20social%20security%20numbers%20or%20other%20information%20that%20could%20be%20used%20for%20identity%20theft%2C%20should%20receive%20greater%20and%20more%20immediate%20protection.%5Cn%5CnIn%20addition%2C%20as%20a%20condition%20of%20participation%20in%20an%20interagency%20data%20information%20system%2C%20such%20as%20the%20California%20Longitudinal%20Pupil%20Achievement%20Data%20System%20%28CALPADS%29%2C%20Education%20Code%2049076%20requires%20that%20the%20district%20develop%20security%20procedures%20or%20devices%20by%20which%20unauthorized%20personnel%20cannot%20access%20data%20in%20the%20system%20and%20procedures%20or%20devices%20to%20secure%20privileged%20or%20confidential%20data%20from%20unauthorized%20disclosure.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-ENzENw18" title="CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 431 mandates districts to establi..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
