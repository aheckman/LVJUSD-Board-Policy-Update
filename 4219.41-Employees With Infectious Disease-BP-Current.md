## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.  Because infectious diseases may be either highly communicable (e.g., influenza, chicken pox) or not casually transmitted (e.g., HIV/AIDs, hepatitis B, hepatitis C), the district's response to an employee with infectious disease should be dependent on any legal protections established for employees and take into consideration the potential risk to students, staff, and others.
The Governing Board desires to promote the health of district students and staff in order to reduce absenteeism and enhance employee and student performance.  The Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies to prevent the outbreak or spread of infectious diseases at district schools.

CSBA NOTE: The following definitions reflect information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) web site.
An infectious disease is one that is caused by a microorganism and is potentially transmittable to another individual, whether through airborne transmission, bloodborne transmission, skin-to-skin contact, foodborne transmission, or other casual or noncasual means.  A communicable infectious disease, such as influenza or chicken pox, is contagious and can be readily transmitted by infectious bacteria or viral organisms.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49406, as amended by AB 1667 (Ch. 329, Statutes of 2014), requires employees, upon being initially employed by the district and at specified periods thereafter, to submit to a tuberculosis risk assessment and, if risk factors are identified, then submit to an approved tuberculin skin test followed by an x-ray when required.  In addition, when the district is filling a certificated position with an applicant who has not previously been employed in a certificated position in California or a retirant who has not previously been employed as a retirant, Education Code 44839 and 44839.5 require the applicant or retirant to provide a medical certification that he/she is free from any disabling disease that renders him/her unfit to instruct children or associate with them. The sample medical certificate provided in 5 CCR 5504 includes an assessment of whether there is evidence of infectious disease in a communicable stage. For further information, see AR 4112.4/4212.4/4312.4 - Health Examinations.
In accordance with law, job applicants shall be required to provide evidence that they are free of tuberculosis or any other communicable infectious disease prior to beginning employment.

To prevent the outbreak or spread of infectious diseases, the Superintendent or designee may provide infection prevention supplies and information to employees, including information about recommended vaccinations. Employees also shall observe universal precautions to avoid contact with potentially infectious blood or other bodily fluids.

CSBA NOTE: CDC recommends that districts develop contingency plans for dealing with an infectious disease outbreak. These contingency plans may be developed with the involvement of local health agencies and/or health care providers and should be incorporated into the district's emergency and disaster preparedness plan. See BP 5141.22 - Infectious Diseases and AR 3516 - Emergencies and Disaster Preparedness Plan as well as CSBA's fact sheets on Pandemic Influenza and H1N1 Influenza (Swine Flu).
Plans for addressing a communicable infectious disease outbreak, including, but not limited to, plans for addressing employee shortages during such an outbreak, shall be included in the district's emergency preparedness plan.

CSBA NOTE: For the protection of the public health, 17 CCR 2500 and 2508 require specified persons to report communicable diseases to the local health officer, as provided below. The list of reportable diseases is available on the California Department of Public Health's (CDPH) web site.  Local health departments may establish additional reporting requirements.
The Superintendent or designee shall immediately report to the local health officer the presence or suspected presence of any communicable infectious disease. In addition, a school nurse or other health care provider who knows of or is in attendance on a case or suspected case of any of the diseases or conditions listed in 17 CCR 2500 shall make a report to the local health officer.  If no health care provider is in attendance, any individual having knowledge of a person who is suspected to be suffering from one of the specified diseases or conditions may make a report to the local health officer. (17 CCR 2500, 2508)

Nondiscrimination/Reasonable Accommodation
CSBA NOTE: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 USC 12101-12213) and California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Government Code 12900-12996) prohibit discrimination in employment on the basis of disability.  Under the ADA and FEHA, an individual is considered to be disabled if he/she has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. According to the CDPH publication California HIV/AIDS Laws, 2009, individuals with clinical HIV disease or AIDS meet the definition of disabled. Court opinions have conflicted as to whether persons with asymptomatic HIV infection meet this definition and districts should consult legal counsel as necessary.In addition, Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that no otherwise qualified person may, solely by reason of his/her disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.  In School Board of Nassau County, Florida v. Arline, the U.S. Supreme Court extended this law's protection to employees significantly impaired by infectious diseases.

The district shall not discriminate against any employee or job applicant who has an infectious disease that meets the federal or state definition of a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, California Fair Employment and Housing Act, or Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act.  (Government Code 12900-12996; 29 USC 794; 42 USC 12101-12213)

CSBA NOTE: Both the ADA (42 USC 12101-12213) and FEHA (Government Code 12900-12996) require employers to reasonably accommodate employees and job applicants with known disabilities; see AR 4032 - Reasonable Accommodation.
Upon request, any qualified person with a disability shall be provided reasonable accommodation to perform the essential duties of his/her position in accordance with the criteria and processes described in AR 4032 - Reasonable Accommodation.
