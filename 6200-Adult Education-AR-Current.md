## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation may be revised for consistency with the adult education plan adopted by the regional consortium established for the Adult Education Program, pursuant to Education Code 84906.
Enrollment

For adult education programs, adults include persons age 18 or older and other persons not concurrently enrolled in a regular high school program. However, high school students may be concurrently enrolled in adult education under the conditions specified in the section "Concurrent Enrollment of High School Students" below.  (Education Code 52523, 52610)

Adults shall have first priority for enrollment in any adult education class, provided they enroll during the regular enrollment period.  (Education Code 52523)

With the exception of programs for adults with disabilities specified in Education Code 52570, adult education classes shall be located in a facility which clearly identifies attendance in the class as being open to the general public.  (Education Code 52517, 52570)

Concurrent Enrollment of High School Students

High school students may be permitted to enroll in an adult education program, course, or class for sound educational purposes, including, but not limited to, the following:  (Education Code 52523)

	The adult education program, course, or class is not offered in the regular high school curriculum.
	 
	The student needs the adult education program, course, or class in order to make up deficient credits for graduation from high school.
	 
	The adult education program, course, or class allows the student to gain vocational and technical skills beyond that provided by the regular high school's vocational and technical education program.
	 
	The adult education program, course, or class supplements and enriches the high school student's educational experience.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional.
High school students are expected to enroll in regular high school classes before seeking admission to any similar classes offered in the adult education program. A failed course, however, may be repeated through adult education.

Before enrolling in an adult education class, the high school student shall complete a counseling session that includes the student, the student's parent/guardian, and a certificated representative of the high school. The certificated high school representative shall ensure that the student's school record includes written documentation of the counseling session and both of the following statements:  (Education Code 52500.1, 52523)

	That the student is enrolling voluntarily in the adult education course or class
	 
	That the enrollment will enhance the student's progress toward meeting educational requirements for high school graduation

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Education Code 52500.1 does not require that the above statement be signed. However, obtaining the signature of all parties is one way to document the student's voluntary participation in the program and the high school representative's determination that the program will enhance the student's progress toward graduation.
The above statement shall be signed by the student, the student's parent/guardian, and the certificated high school representative.

Classes offered in the district's adult education program shall supplement and not supplant the regular high school curriculum. No course required by the district for high school graduation or necessary for students to maintain satisfactory academic progress shall be offered exclusively through the adult education program.  (Education Code 52523)

Programs and Courses

CSBA NOTE: The following list should be revised to reflect the types of adult education programs offered by the district. Education Code 41976, as amended by AB 486 (Ch. 666, Statutes of 2022), authorizes the use of Adult Education Program funds to support the programs listed in Items #1-7 below. Local control funding formula (LCFF) and/or other district funds may be used for many of these same purposes.
The district's adult education program shall offer instruction in one or more of the following areas:  (Education Code 41976)

	Programs in elementary and secondary basic skills, including programs leading to a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52550-52555 require establishing citizenship programs in high school districts when 25 or more persons residing in the district apply for such training, and permit such classes upon demand when there are a lesser number of applicants. Pursuant to Education Code 41976, as amended by AB 486, the course may include immigrant integration.
	Programs for immigrants eligible for educational services in citizenship, English as a second language, workforce preparation, and immigrant integration
	 
	Programs that are primarily related to entry or reentry into the workforce
	 
	Programs that are primarily designed to develop knowledge and skills to assist elementary and secondary students to succeed academically in school
	 
	Programs for adults with disabilities
	 
	Short-term career technical education programs with high employment potential
	 
	Programs offering pre-apprenticeship training activities in coordination with one or more apprenticeship programs approved by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards for the occupation and geographic area.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52540 sets conditions for establishing English as a second language classes in high school districts when 20 or more adults residing in the district apply for such classes.
The district may also offer programs in parenting, family and consumer awareness, English as a second language, classes for older adults, home economics, and health and safety education. Such programs shall not be paid for with Adult Education Program Funds.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51056 and 52515, adult education courses must be approved by the California Department of Education (CDE). According to CDE's website, within 20 working days of receiving a request, CDE will provide electronic certification of course approval. Authorized courses are listed in the Adult Education Course Approval System (A-22) on CDE's web site.
The Superintendent or designee shall regularly submit to the California Department of Education for approval the titles of classes that have been approved by the Governing Board to be offered in any of the program areas listed above.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that offer community service classes; see BP 6142.4 - Service Learning/Community Service Classes. Pursuant to Education Code 51810, the district may provide community service classes in specified subjects without the approval of CDE.
Adults may also be enrolled in community service classes offered by the district.  (Education Code 51811)

All adult education programs, courses, and classes and their enrollment period shall be published in the district's catalog of adult education classes provided to the public.  (Education Code 52523)

Independent Study

The Superintendent or designee may make independent study available as an instructional strategy for students enrolled in adult education as appropriate to meet their individual needs.

Student participation in independent study shall be voluntary and no student shall be required to participate.  (Education Code 51747)

Fees

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52612-52613 authorize the district to charge fees for adult education classes, with certain exceptions. The total of these fees plus revenues derived from average daily attendance must not exceed the estimated cost of all such classes. The following section should be revised to reflect district practice.
The district may require fees for enrollment in an adult education class. However, no fees shall be charged for the following adult education programs or classes:  (Education Code 52612, 52613)

	A class for which high school credit is granted, if the class is taken by an individual who does not hold a high school diploma.
	 
	A class in an elementary subject or a class in English as a second language or citizenship, unless the student is a nonimmigrant with an F-1 visa status. Any nonimmigrant enrolled in these classes shall be charged a fee to cover the full cost of the instruction, not to exceed actual costs. The fee shall be adopted by the Board at a regular meeting at least 90 days before the beginning of the class for which the fee is charged.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional.
Except for those fees required by law, the payment of fees may be waived in cases of hardship at the recommendation of the Superintendent or designee.

The Board may fix a charge, not to exceed cost, for books furnished to adult education students.  In lieu of fixing such charge, books may be loaned to students with the payment of a refundable deposit.   (Education Code 60410)
