## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The Education Code provides a number of options under which a district may enroll a student whose parent/guardian does not reside within district boundaries. Under an "interdistrict attendance permit" or "reciprocal agreement" pursuant to Education Code 46600-46610, a student may attend school in a different district when both the district of residence and the district of proposed attendance agree (Option 1 below). Alternatively, pursuant to Education Code 48300-48317, as amended by AB 185 (Ch. 571, Statutes of 2022), the Governing Board may, until July 1, 2028, declare the district to be a "school district of choice" willing to accept a specific number of interdistrict transfers into the district through a random selection process (Option 2 below). In order to maintain the integrity of the random selection process, it is recommended that a school district of choice not also accept transfers under the interdistrict attendance permit option except when extraordinary circumstances exist, as provided in Option 2 below. Districts that wish to use both sources of authority should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.In addition to these options, pursuant to Education 48345, as added by SB 941 (Ch. 711, Statutes of 2022), the Board is authorized, until July 1, 2029, to enter into an agreement with other local educational agencies (LEA) to offer courses and coursework to students from another LEA who have been impacted by disruptions or cancellations to specified courses, or teacher shortages to such courses. See the section "Instruction Collaboration Agreements" below.Pursuant to Education Code 48204, a district may authorize a student whose parent/guardian is employed within district boundaries to attend a school in the district (Allen bill transfer); see AR 5111.1 - District Residency.
The Governing Board recognizes that parents/guardians of students who reside within the geographic boundaries of one district may, for a variety of reasons, desire to enroll their children in a school in another district.

OPTION 1: Interdistrict Attendance Agreements and Permits

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that have entered into an agreement with one or more other districts to accept student transfers through interdistrict attendance permits pursuant to Education Code 46600-46610. Districts selecting this option should also select Option 1 in the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Board may enter into an agreement with any other school district, for a term not to exceed five school years, for the interdistrict attendance of students who are residents of the districts.  (Education Code 46600)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 46600 requires that the interdistrict attendance agreement specify the terms and conditions under which individual permits may be granted or denied. In addition, pursuant to Education Code 46600, students who have been granted an interdistrict attendance permit must be allowed to continue to attend the school without having to reapply unless the agreement between the two districts contains specific agreed-upon standards for reapplication; see the accompanying administrative regulation. Districts also may include in the agreement the agreed-upon standards for revocation of students' interdistrict attendance. Examples of conditions that may result in revocation include falsification of information stated on the permit application, unsatisfactory attendance, continual disruption, or poor academic achievement.
The agreement shall specify the terms and conditions under which interdistrict attendance shall be permitted or denied. It also may contain standards agreed upon by both districts for reapplication and/or revocation of the student's permit.  (Education Code 46600)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46600, it is the responsibility of the Superintendent or designee of the district of residence, subject to Board policies of the district of residence and terms of the agreement, to issue an individual permit verifying the district's approval of an interdistrict transfer out of the district. The permit shall become valid when endorsed by the Board's designee in the district of proposed enrollment.See the accompanying administrative regulation for procedures to follow when the permit is denied.
Upon receiving a permit for transfer into the district that has been approved by the student's district of residence, or upon receiving a written request from the parent/guardian of a district student who wishes to enroll in another district, the Superintendent or designee shall review the request and may approve or deny the permit subject to the terms and conditions of the interdistrict attendance agreement.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  School District of Choice Program

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that elect to participate in the school district of choice program pursuant to Education Code 48300-48317. Pursuant to Education Code 48301, such a district must register as a school district of choice with the Superintendent of Public Instruction and County Board of Education before enrolling students under this option. Districts selecting this option should also select Option 2 in the accompanying administrative regulation.Pursuant to Education Code 48315, as amended by AB 185 (Ch. 571, Statutes of 2022), the school district of choice program has been extended until July 1, 2028.
The Board has designated the district as a "school district of choice" and shall accept students who reside within other California school districts who wish to attend a district school.

The Board shall, by resolution, annually establish the number of students who will be accepted into the district through this program based on recommendations by the Superintendent or designee as to the number of transfer students the district will be able to accept and the schools, grades, and programs that will be able to accept the students. Once established, the district shall accept all students who apply to transfer into the district until the district is at maximum capacity, as required pursuant to Education Code 48301.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48301 requires a random, unbiased process for selecting students who will be admitted through the school district of choice program and prohibits consideration of certain characteristics and factors in making the selections. Pursuant to Education Code 48301, family income may only be considered to the extent necessary to determine enrollment priority pursuant to Education Code 48306; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
Students shall be admitted to district schools through an unbiased process that prohibits an inquiry into or evaluation or consideration of whether a student should be enrolled based upon the student's academic or athletic performance, physical condition, proficiency in English, any of the individual characteristics set forth in Education Code 200, or family income.  (Education Code 48301)

If the number of transfer applications exceeds the number of transfers the Board has elected to accept, approval for transfer shall be determined by a random drawing held in public at a regularly scheduled Board meeting.  (Education Code 48301)

CSBA NOTE: Because the school district of choice program requires a random selection process, it is recommended that participating districts not admit students through the interdistrict attendance permit process described in Option 1 above except under extraordinary circumstances. Such circumstances might include approving interdistrict attendance permits for students who are victims of an act of bullying. Such students are given priority for interdistrict attendance permits pursuant to Education Code 46600; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
Because the district admits students in accordance with the school district of choice program, the Superintendent or designee shall not admit students based on individual interdistrict attendance permits, pursuant to Education Code 46600-46610, except under extraordinary circumstances.

The Superintendent or designee shall keep an accounting of all requests for admittance through the school district of choice program and a record of their disposition, including, but not limited to, all of the following:  (Education Code 48313)

	The number of requests granted, denied, or withdrawn and, for denied requests, the reason for the denial
	 
	The number of students transferred into and out of the district pursuant to this program
	 
	The race, ethnicity, gender, self-reported socioeconomic status, eligibility for free or reduced-price meals, and the district of residence for each student transferred into or out of the district pursuant to this program
	 
	The number of students transferred into or out of the district pursuant to this program who are classified as English learners or students with disabilities
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48311 authorizes, but does not require, a school district of choice to provide transportation to participating students to the extent that the district provides transportation assistance to other students. See section on "Transportation" below. Item #5 may be deleted by districts that do not provide transportation.
	As applicable, the number of students described in Items #3 and 4 above who are provided transportation assistance to a district school or program, and the total number of students provided transportation assistance, pursuant to the school district of choice program

The information specified in Items #1-5 above shall be reported by the Superintendent or designee to the Board, at a regularly scheduled meeting. No later than October 15 of each year, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the same information for the current school year, as well as information regarding the district's status as a school district of choice in the upcoming school year, to each geographically adjacent school district, the county office of education, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction.  (Education Code 48313)

The district's compliance with specified program requirements shall be reviewed as part of the annual district audit conducted pursuant to Education Code 41020.  (Education Code 48301)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

Instruction Collaboration Agreements

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48345, as added by SB 941, the Board may enter into an instruction collaboration agreement (ICA) with school districts, county offices of education or charter schools to offer the same or similar corresponding individual courses and coursework to students from another LEA who have been impacted by teacher shortages, disruptions or cancellations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes, or disruptions or cancellations in dual language immersion programs.
The Superintendent or designee may, with board approval, enter into an instruction collaboration agreement (ICA) with another school district, county office of education or charter school to offer the same or similar courses and coursework to students who have been impacted by any of the following:  (Education Code 48345)

	Disruptions or cancellations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes
	 
	Disruptions or cancellations in dual language immersion programs
	 
	Teacher shortages in STEM classes or dual language immersion programs

Prior to accepting students for classes for any of the reasons specified in Items #1-3 above, the Superintendent or designee shall, with Board Approval, determine the maximum number of students that the district can accept for these purposes. The district shall accept students who apply until the district is at maximum capacity.

Students shall be admitted to this program through an unbiased process that prohibits an inquiry into, or evaluation or consideration of, whether a student should be authorized to participate in the course or coursework based upon the student's current academic or athletic performance, proficiency in English, physical condition, any of the individual characteristics specified in Education Code 200, or family income. If the number of applicants exceeds the number of seats available, the approval for participation shall be determined by a random public drawing at a regularly scheduled Board meeting.  (Education Code 48345)

The Superintendent or designee shall publicly post information, including, but not limited to, applicable forms and timelines for submission pursuant to the ICA, to ensure that students and their families are aware of the opportunities to participate.  (Education Code 48345)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48345, as added by SB 941, the average daily attendance attributable to a student participating in the ICA shall remain with the LEA of origination for purposes of state apportionment.
When negotiating the ICA, the Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with the other participating LEA(s) to agree upon an appropriate shared cost structure.  (Education Code 48345)

Transportation

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by all districts and should be revised to reflect district practice. Districts are not required to provide transportation or transportation assistance to students admitted under an interdistrict attendance permit pursuant to Education Code 46600-46610, except that Education Code 46600, requires the district of enrollment to provide transportation assistance to a student who is eligible for free or reduced price meals and is either a child of an active military duty parent/guardian or a victim of an act of bullying, as defined in Education Code 48900.Pursuant to Education Code 48311, a school district of choice is authorized, but not required, to provide transportation assistance to the extent that the district otherwise provides transportation assistance to students.
Upon parent/guardian request, the district shall provide transportation assistance to a student receiving an interdistrict transfer who is eligible for free and reduced-price meals and is the child of an active duty military parent/guardian or a victim of bullying, as defined in Education Code 46600.  (Education Code 46600)

In addition, upon request of a student's parent/guardian, the Superintendent or designee may authorize transportation for any interdistrict transfer student to and from designated bus stops within the attendance area of the school that the student attends if space is available.
