Involuntary Transfer

CSBA NOTE: Districts that assign students to continuation schools are mandated by Education Code 48432.5 to adopt rules and regulations governing procedures for involuntary transfer. Pursuant to Education Code 48432.5, districts may only involuntarily transfer students who meet one of the conditions specified in Items #1-2 below and may not establish additional criteria for involuntary transfers. However, districts are not required to involuntarily transfer such students, and may delete Item #1 or 2 below to reflect district practice.
A decision to transfer a student involuntarily into continuation education classes shall be based on a finding that the student:  (Education Code 48432.5)

	Committed an act enumerated in Education Code 48900
	 
	Has been habitually truant or irregular in attendance from instruction the student is lawfully required to attend.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48432.5 requires that involuntary transfer to a continuation school be made only when other means fail to bring about student improvement, as provided below. In Nathan G. v. Clovis Unified School District, the court of appeals upheld the district's decision to transfer a high school student to continuation school for an act enumerated in Education Code 48900, rejecting the student's argument that the district was first required to exhaust all other means of correction to bring about student improvement and concluding that an involuntary transfer to continuation school does not substantially affect a student's fundamental right to an education.
Involuntary transfer to a continuation school shall be made only when other means fail to bring about student improvement. However, a student may be involuntarily transferred the first time an act enumerated in Education Code 48900 is committed if the principal determines that the student's presence causes a danger to persons or property or threatens to disrupt the instructional process.  (Education Code 48432.5)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48432.5, as amended by AB 740 (Ch. 400, Statutes of 2022), mandates that the district's rules and regulations pertaining to involuntary transfer of students to continuation schools provide written notice to the student and the student's parent/guardian, or, if the student is a foster youth, to the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and social worker, or, if the student is an Indian child, the Indian child's tribal social worker, and if applicable, county social worker, of the opportunity to request a meeting with the Superintendent or designee, as provided below.
Prior to an involuntary transfer, the student and the student's parent/guardian, or a foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney and social worker, or an Indian child's tribal social worker, and if applicable, county social worker, shall be given written notice that a meeting may be requested with the Superintendent or designee.  (Education Code 48432.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48432.5, as amended by AB 740, a foster youth's educational right's holder, attorney, and county social worker, and an Indian child's tribal social worker, and, if applicable, a county social worker, have the same rights as a parent at the meeting with the Superintendent or designee.
At the meeting, the student and the student's parent/guardian, or, if the student is a foster youth, the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or, if the student is an Indian child, the Indian child's tribal social worker, or, if applicable, county social worker, shall be informed of the specific facts and reasons for the proposed transfer, and have the opportunity to inspect all documents relied upon, question any evidence and witnesses presented, and present evidence on the student's behalf. The student may designate one or more representatives and witnesses to be present with the student at the meeting.  (Education Code 48432.5)

A written decision to transfer, stating the facts and reasons for the decision, shall be sent to the student and the student's parent/guardian or, if the student is a foster youth, the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or, if the student is an Indian child, the Indian child's tribal social worker, or, if applicable, county social worker. It shall indicate whether the decision is subject to periodic review and the procedure for such review.  (Education Code 48432.5)

The persons making the final decision for involuntary transfer shall not be members of the staff of the school in which the student is enrolled at the time.  (Education Code 48432.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48432.5, involuntary transfers cannot extend beyond the end of the semester following the semester in which the acts leading to the transfer occurred, unless the district adopts a procedure for conducting yearly review at the request of the student,  the student's parent/guardian, or, if the student is a foster youth, the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or, if the student is an Indian child, the Indian child's tribal social worker, or, if applicable, county social worker. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
No involuntary transfer to a continuation school shall extend beyond the end of the semester following the semester when the acts leading to the involuntary transfer occurred.  (Education Code 48432.5)

Voluntary Enrollment

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that allow students to voluntarily enroll in continuation education classes; see the accompanying Board policy for more information regarding voluntary enrollment. Pursuant to Education Code 48432.3, such districts are mandated to adopt policy and procedures containing specified provisions and governing the identification, placement, and intake procedures for students who voluntarily enroll. The following section should be revised to reflect district practice.
As space permits, students who meet the eligibility criteria specified in Board policy may voluntarily enroll in a continuation school. A student may be considered for placement in the continuation school whenever the student's parent/guardian submits a written request to the Superintendent or designee or the student is referred by a counselor or school administrator.

Approval of a student's voluntary transfer shall be based on a finding that the placement will promote the educational interests of the student.  (Education Code 48432.3)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48432.3 mandates that the district's procedures ensure all of the conditions specified in Items #1-2 and 4-7, below.
Voluntary enrollment shall be subject to the following conditions:  (Education Code 48432.3, 48432.5)

	A student's voluntary placement in continuation education shall not be used as an alternative to expulsion unless alternative means of correction have been attempted pursuant to Education Code 48900.5.
	 
	The district shall strive to ensure that no specific group of students, including a group based on race, ethnicity, language status, or special needs, is disproportionately enrolled in continuation education within the district.
	
	CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph implements the above requirement and may be revised to reflect district practice.
	The Superintendent or designee shall annually review disaggregated student enrollment data and report such data to the Governing Board. If it is determined that one or more student groups are enrolled in continuation education at a significantly higher level than their proportional enrollment in the district, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct a review of enrollment criteria and procedures to determine the reason for the disproportionate enrollment.
	 
	A copy of this administrative regulation and accompanying Board policy shall be provided to a student whose voluntary transfer to a continuation school is under consideration and to the student's parent/guardian.
	 
	Before a student is transferred and upon request by the student's parent/guardian, the parent/guardian may meet with a counselor, principal, or administrator from both the school that the student is currently attending and the continuation school to determine if transferring is the best option for the student.
	 
	To the extent possible, voluntary transfer to a continuation school shall occur within the first four weeks of each semester.
	 
	The transfer is voluntary, and the student has a right to return to the student's previous school.
	 
	A student who is voluntarily enrolled in continuation education may return to the regular high school at the beginning of the following school year, or at any other time with the consent of the Superintendent or designee.

Intake and Orientation

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48432.3, districts that allow students to voluntarily enroll in continuation education are mandated to adopt intake procedures for such students. The following section addresses intake and orientation for all students enrolled in continuation education and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Upon voluntary or involuntary transfer to a continuation education program, an intake meeting shall be conducted with each student and the student's parent/guardian. At this meeting, the principal or counselor shall provide information about each course and the number of credits that the student needs to complete in order to graduate and shall develop an individualized academic plan for the student. The student, and the student's parent/guardian as appropriate, shall sign a contract indicating their commitment to these objectives.

In addition, at the beginning of each school year, the district coordinator for continuation education, school counselor(s), or other designee(s) shall provide an orientation session for all incoming students and their parents/guardians in order to explain the credit recovery process and establish expectations for student conduct and participation. As appropriate, extended orientation sessions may be provided to assist students in developing academic, social, communication, anger management, or other skills necessary to success in school.

Minimum Attendance Requirement

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46170, the minimum school day for continuation high schools and classes is 180 minutes and no student will be credited with more than 15 hours of attendance per school week for apportionment purposes. However, the California Department of Education's web site reports that many continuation high schools provide full-day programs that exceed the minimum daily requirement. The following section may be revised to reflect district practice.
In continuation high schools and classes, a day of attendance shall be at least 180 minutes. (Education Code 46170)

Each student shall attend classes for not less than 15 hours per week.  However, if a student gives satisfactory proof of regular employment, the student may attend classes for not less than four hours per week for the regular school term.  These requirements may be met by any combination of attendance in a continuation education class and/or regional occupational center or program.  (Education Code 46170, 48402, 48400)

Leaves of Absence

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48416, students age 16-18 years may take leaves of absence in accordance with law provided that the Board has adopted policy allowing such leaves of absence; see BP/AR 5112.3 - Student Leave of Absence. The following optional section is for use by districts that allow such leaves of absence for students in compulsory continuation education classes.
A student enrolled in compulsory continuation education classes may take a leave of absence for up to two semesters for the purpose of supervised travel, study, training, or work in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.  (Education Code 48416)

Reenrollment

Any person age 16 or 17 years who terminated enrollment in continuation school after obtaining a certificate of proficiency may reenroll in the district once without prejudice.  If the student leaves a second time, the Superintendent or designee may deny reenrollment until the beginning of the next semester.  (Education Code 48414)
