## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes its responsibility to represent the public's interests in the collective bargaining process. In ratifying agreements on employee contracts, the Board shall balance the needs of staff and the priorities of the District in order to provide students with a high-quality instructional program based on a sound, realistic budget.

The Board and the Superintendent shall establish a bargaining team to assist in analyzing contract provisions and conducting contract negotiations. The Board shall provide its negotiator(s) with expected outcomes and clear parameters for acceptable contract provisions which promote the realization of District goals and priorities.

The Board and its bargaining team shall negotiate in good faith with exclusive employee representatives on wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of employment identified in law as being within the scope of representation. (Government Code 3543.2)

When the District intends to make any change to matters within the scope of representation, it shall give reasonable written notice of its intent to the exclusive representative for the purpose of providing the exclusive representative a reasonable amount of time to negotiate with the District regarding the proposed changes.  (Government Code 3543.2)

A reasonable number of representatives of the employee organization shall have the right to receive reasonable periods of released time without loss of District compensation when meeting and negotiating and/or for the processing of grievances.  (Government Code 3543.1)

The Board and its bargaining team shall establish standards of conduct pertaining to the negotiations process for members of the bargaining team. Certain meetings related to negotiations shall not be open to the public in accordance with Government Code 3549.1 and 54957.6, except as otherwise required by law. Matters discussed in these meetings shall be kept in strict confidence in accordance with law.

The Board and its negotiator(s) shall not knowingly provide the employee organization with inaccurate information regarding the financial resources of the District.  (Government Code 3543.5)

The Board shall monitor the progress of negotiations and carefully consider how proposed contract provisions would affect the District's short- and long-term fiscal, programmatic, instructional, and personnel goals.

The Board and/or Superintendent or designee shall keep the public informed about the progress of negotiations and the ways in which negotiations may affect District goals unless otherwise agreed upon by the District and exclusive representative.

Whenever the District has a qualified or negative certification on an interim fiscal report, it shall allow the county office of education at least 10 working days to review and comment on any proposed agreement with exclusive representatives of employees. The District shall provide the County Superintendent of Schools with all information relevant to gain an understanding of the financial impact of any final collective bargaining agreement. (Government Code 3540.2)

Once the final terms of the agreement have been ratified by the membership of the employee organization, the contract shall be presented to the Board at a public meeting for acceptance.

Any agreement adopted by the Board may be for a term not to exceed three years. (Government Code 3540.1)

In the event of an impasse in negotiations, the District shall participate in good faith in mediation and fact-finding procedures pursuant to Government Code 3548-3548.8.  (Government Code 3543.5)

Following adoption of the collective bargaining agreement, any subsequent amendments shall be executed in writing and ratified by the Board and the employees' exclusive representative.

Consultation

The exclusive representative of certificated staff may consult with the Board on the definition of educational objectives, the determination of the content of courses and curriculum, and the selection of textbooks.
