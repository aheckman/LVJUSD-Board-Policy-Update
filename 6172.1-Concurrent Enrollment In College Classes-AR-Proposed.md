## Policy Content

Credit

District students enrolled in a community college as special part-time students, for example Middle College High School Program, may enroll in up to 11 units per semester, or the equivalent. Such students shall receive credit for community college courses that they complete in an amount jointly determined appropriate by the District and the community college governing board. (Education Code 48800, 76001, 76004)

A written agreement regarding the student's enrollment in postsecondary courses and the credits to be awarded for successful completion shall be signed by the student, parent/guardian, principal or Middle College Coordinator, and college representative.

To potentially receive District credit for coursework completed through a community college or four-year college, the student or parent/guardian shall submit an official college transcript showing completion of the course with a passing grade.

College and Career Access Pathways Partnerships

The District may enter into a CCAP agreement, in accordance with Education Code 76004, which includes terms regarding course offerings, student eligibility, protocols for sharing information, joint facilities use, and staff qualifications.

A copy of the CCAP agreement shall be filed with the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and with the California Department of Education before the start of the agreement. (Education Code 76004)

Only courses that provide career technical education or preparation for transfer, assist in improving high school graduation rates, or help high school students achieve college and career readiness shall be offered, and physical education courses shall not be provided. (Education Code 76004)

A high school student shall submit one parental consent form and principal recommendation for the duration of the student's concurrent enrollment under a CCAP partnership. (Education Code 76004)

The District shall report information annually to the office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges as specified in Education Code 76004.

Minimum School Day

A student enrolled full-time at a community college shall be exempted from full-time attendance in the District's regular education program. (Education Code 48800.5)

However, both part-time and full-time community college students shall be required to undertake courses of instruction of a scope and duration sufficient to satisfy the requirements of law. (Education Code 48800.5, 48801)

Community College Classes on High School Campus

If a community college class is to be offered at a District high school campus, the class shall be held during the time the campus is open to the general public as determined by the Board of Education. Members of the public who are enrolled in community college class(es) shall register immediately upon entering school buildings or grounds.
