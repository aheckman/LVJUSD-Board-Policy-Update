Education Code 56195.1 prohibits a district from creating a single-district SELPA until July 1, 2024.Each SELPA is required to develop and administer a local plan describing how it will provide special education services.  Pursuant to Education Code 56195.5, the Governing Board has authority, consistent with the SELPA plan, over the programs it directly maintains.The following policy and accompanying administrative regulation should be revised to reflect requirements for the type of SELPA in which the district participates.
The Governing Board recognizes its obligation to provide a free appropriate public education to all individuals with disabilities, aged 3 to 21 years, who reside in the district.

CSBA NOTE: Option 1 below is for use by districts that have their own single-district SELPA.  Option 2 below is for use by districts that join with other districts to form a SELPA.  Option 3 below is for use by districts that join with a COE to form a SELPA.

The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district and/or SELPA practice.
Special education programs and services shall be reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The results of such evaluations shall be used to identify and correct any program deficiencies.
