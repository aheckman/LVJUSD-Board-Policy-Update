Definitions

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54221, as amended by AB 480 (Ch. 788, Statutes of 2023), defines the term "dispose", as reflected below.
Dispose means either (1) the sale of surplus land or (2) the lease of surplus land for a term longer than 15 years, inclusive of any extension or renewal options included in the terms of the initial lease. Dispose does not include the entering of a lease for surplus land on which no development or demolition will occur, regardless of the term of the lease.  (Government Code 54221)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54221, as amended by AB 480, lists what constitutes "exempt surplus land." As many of the exemptions do not apply to school districts, only some are included in the definition of exempt surplus land below. Additional information on exempt surplus land is available in the California Department of Housing and Community Development's August 2024 publication, "Updated Surplus Land Act Guidelines."
Under the Surplus Land Act, exempt surplus land means land, as described in Items #1-10 below, that is:  (Government Code 54221)


	Less than one-half acre in area and is not contiguous to land owned by a state or local agency that is used for open-space or low- and moderate-income housing purposes
	 
	Being exchanged for another property necessary for the district's use, including easements, pursuant to Education Code 17536
	 
	Subject to the district advisory committee pursuant to Education Code 17388
	 
	Jointly occupied by the district and any private person, firm, local governmental agency or corporation pursuant to Education Code 17515
	 
	Being transferred to a local, state, or federal agency, or to a third-party intermediary for future dedication for the receiving agency's use, or to a federally recognized California Indian tribe
	 
	A former street, right of way, or easement, and is conveyed to an owner of an adjacent property
	 
	Developed for low- or moderate-income housing development that meets specified criteria
	 
	Subject to a valid legal restriction that is not imposed by the district and that makes housing prohibited, such as a conservation easement
	 
	Transferred to a community land trust, and meets certain specified conditions
	 
	Included in any of the other exemptions specified in Government Code 54221

District Advisory Committee

CSBA NOTE: Prior to the sale or lease of the property, Education Code 17388 requires the Governing Board to appoint a district advisory committee, often referred to as the 7-11 Committee, to advise the Board in the disposition of the property. For more information regarding district advisory committees, including when they are not required, see the accompanying Board policy.
The district advisory committee, which may be referred to as a "7-11 Committee," on use or disposition of surplus school buildings or space shall consist of not less than seven or more than 11 members representative of each of the following:  (Education Code 17389)

	The district's ethnic, age group, and socioeconomic composition
	 
	The business community, such as store owners, managers, or supervisors
	 
	Landowners or renters, with preference to representatives of neighborhood associations
	 
	Teachers
	 
	Administrators
	 
	Parents/guardians of students
	 
	Persons with expertise in environmental impact, legal contracts, building codes, and land use planning, including, but not limited to, knowledge of the zoning and other land use restrictions of the cities and counties in which the surplus property is located

This committee shall:  (Education Code 17390)


	Review projected school enrollment and other data to determine the amount of surplus space and real property
	 
	Establish and circulate throughout the attendance area a priority list for use of surplus space and real property that will be acceptable to the community
	 
	Hold hearings, with community input, on acceptable uses of space and real property, including the sale or lease of surplus real property for child care development purposes
	 
	Make a final determination of limits of tolerance of use of space and real property
	 
	Send the Governing Board a report recommending uses of surplus space and real property

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54952, the Brown Act applies to a committee created by formal action of the Board, regardless of whether that body is permanent or temporary, decision making, or advisory. Thus, because Education Code 17388 specifies that the district advisory committee is appointed by the Board, meetings of that committee are subject to the Brown Act. It is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel when questions arise regarding the applicability of Brown Act requirements to district or school committees. See AR 1220 - Citizen Advisory Committees and BB 9130 - Board Committees.
The district advisory committee shall comply with open meeting requirements of the Brown Act.  (Government Code 54952)
