## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board believes that grades serve a valuable instructional purpose by helping students and parents/guardians understand performance expectations and identifying the student's areas of strength and those areas needing improvement. Parents/guardians and students have the right to receive course grades that represent an accurate evaluation of the student's academic performance.

The Superintendent or designee shall establish a uniform grading system that shall be applied to all students in that course and grade level. Teachers shall inform students and parents/guardians how academic performance will be evaluated in the classroom.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. CSBA's governance brief Research-Supported Strategies to Improve the Accuracy and Fairness of Grades reviews research on the fairness, accuracy, and consistency of common grading practices. Based on research, the brief recommends that nonacademic factors (e.g., attendance, effort, behavior, work habits) not be incorporated into the academic grade, which is intended to be an indicator of a student's mastery of academic content.
A teacher shall base a student's grades solely on the quality of the student's academic work and his/her mastery of course content based on district standards. Students shall have the opportunity to demonstrate this mastery through a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, tests, projects, portfolios, and/or class discussion as appropriate. Other elements that are not a direct measure of knowledge and understanding of course content, such as attendance, effort, student conduct, and work habits, shall not be factored into the academic grade but may be reported separately.

Whenever a student misses an assignment or assessment due to either an excused or unexcused absence, he/she shall be given full credit for subsequent satisfactory completion of the assignment or assessment.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49067, the Governing Board may authorize teachers to assign failing grades to students with excessive unexcused absences, the number to be set by the Board. Districts using the following optional paragraph should fill in the blank to specify the number of unexcused absences that the Board determines to be "excessive." Alternatively, districts may revise the following paragraph to limit the degree to which a teacher may reduce a grade for attendance reasons.However, CSBA's governance brief Research-Supported Strategies to Improve the Accuracy and Fairness of Grades recommends that student absence be dealt with separately from grading and that absence should not be considered in determining a student's level of understanding of course content. See BP/AR 5113.1 - Chronic Absence and Truancy for further information about strategies to address excessive excused and/or unexcused absences.
A teacher may assign a failing grade to a student who has ____(fill in number)___ or more unexcused absences during the grading period.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that maintain elementary schools and should be revised to reflect district practice.
Students in grades K-3 shall receive progress reports at the end of each grading period rather than letter grades.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that choose to provide reports of academic performance on specific academic standards, and should be deleted by other districts.
At all grade levels, report cards may include reports of student progress on specific academic standards applicable to the course and grade level.

When reporting student performance to parents/guardians, teachers may add narrative descriptions, observational notes, and/or samples of classroom work in order to better describe student progress in specific skills and subcategories of achievement.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph reflects correspondence issued by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, Report Cards and Transcripts for Students with Disabilities, which clarifies that, because report cards are intended for parents/guardians and not for persons outside the district, they may contain information about a student's disability without violating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 USC 1232g; 34 CFR 99.1-99.67). However, transcripts may not provide information about a student's disability because there is an expectation that these documents could be shared with persons other than the student and his/her parents/guardians. See BP/AR 5125 - Student Records for further information regarding the confidentiality of student records.
A report card for a student with a disability may contain information about his/her disability, including whether that student received special education or related services, provided that the report card informs parents/guardians about their child's progress or level of achievement in specific classes, course content, or curriculum. However, transcripts that may be used to inform postsecondary institutions or prospective employers of the student's academic achievements shall not contain information disclosing the student's disability.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49066 provides that the grade assigned by a teacher is final, absent any clerical or mechanical mistake, fraud, bad faith, or incompetency. Pursuant to Education Code 49066, the Board and Superintendent cannot order a student's grade changed unless the teacher, to the extent practicable, is given an opportunity to state the reasons that the grade was given and to be included in all discussions regarding the changing of the grade; see AR 5125.3 - Challenging Student Records.
A grade assigned by the teacher shall not be changed by the Board or the Superintendent except as provided by law, Board policy, or administrative regulation. (Education Code 49066)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that maintain secondary schools and may be revised to reflect district practice. Also see the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Superintendent or designee shall determine the methodology to be used in calculating students' grade point average (GPA), including the courses to be included within the GPA and whether extra grade weighting shall be applied to Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, honors, and/or concurrent postsecondary courses.
