## Policy Content

An interdistrict attendance agreement shall be initiated by the district of residence and shall require the appropriate signatures of the receiving district. An application is required for students leaving or entering the District. Applications must be renewed on an annual basis. Transportation is the responsibility of the parents/guardians.

The Student Services Department shall be responsible for processing interdistrict transfer requests. Staff will work to assure that incoming students are placed in schools according to the parent/guardians choice. Applications will normally be approved unless space is not available. Once a student has been admitted by an intersdistrict agreement, he/she is welcomed and encouraged to continue attending Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District as long as his/her behavior, attendance, and achievement meet District expectations, consistent with the student’s rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

The parent/guardian of a student who is denied an interdistrict transfer request may appeal the decision to the District Superintendent and the Board of Education. Requests that are denied by the Superintendent and/or Board of Education may be appealed within 30 days to the County Board of Education.

Students expelled from other school districts for certain serious offenses specified in Education Code 48915(a) or (c) are not eligible for an interdistrict transfer during the period of their expulsion. Prior to considering the transfer request of a student who had a prior expulsion, the Student Services Department shall hold a hearing to determine whether the student poses a danger to the students, staff or the District.

Until the District is at maximum capacity, the District shall accept any student whose interdistrict transfer application is based on being the victim of an act of bullying or a child of an active duty military parent/guardian. The District shall ensure that such students are admitted through an unbiased process that prohibits an inquiry into or evaluation or consideration of whether or not a student should be enrolled based on academic or athletic performance, physical condition, proficiency in English, family income, or any of the individual characteristics set forth in Education Code 220, including, but not limited to, race or ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, and immigration status. (Education Code 46600)

Interdistrict Attendance Agreements and Permits

In accordance with an agreement between the LVJUSD Board of Education and the Alameda County Office of Education, an application authorizing a student of a district within Alameda County to enroll in another district within Alameda County may be issued upon approval of both districts.

The District shall post on its website the procedures and timelines for requesting an interdistrict transfer permit, including a link to BP 5117 - Interdistrict Attendance. The posted information shall include, but is not limited to:  (Education Code 46600.1, 46600.2)


	The date upon which the District will begin accepting and processing interdistrict transfer requests for the following school year.
	 
	The reasons for which the District may approve or deny a request, and any information or documents that must be submitted as supporting evidence
	 
	If applicable, the process and timelines by which a denial of a request may be appealed within the District before the District renders a final decision
	 
	A statement that failure of a parent/guardian to meet any timelines established by the District shall be deemed an abandonment of the request
	 
	Applicable timelines for processing a request.
	 
	The conditions under which an existing interdistrict transfer permit may be revoked or rescinded.


Priority for interdistrict attendance shall be given to a student who has been determined, through an investigation by either the district of residence or district of proposed enrollment, to be a victim of an act of bullying, as defined in Education Code 48900(r), committed by a student of the district of residence.  (Education Code 46600)

Until the District is at maximum capacity, the District shall accept any student whose interdistrict transfer application is based on being the victim of an act of bullying or a child of an active duty military parent/guardian. The District shall ensure that such students are admitted through an unbiased process that prohibits an inquiry into or evaluation or consideration of whether or not a student should be enrolled based on academic or athletic performance, physical condition, proficiency in English, family income, or any of the individual characteristics set forth in Education Code 220, including, but not limited to, race or ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, and immigration status.  (Education Code 46600)

In addition, the Superintendent or designee may approve an interdistrict attendance permit for a student for any of the following reasons when stipulated in the agreement:


	To meet the child care needs of the student, grades K-6 only,  only as long as the student's child care provider remains within District boundaries
	 
	When the student’s parents are employed within the city of Livermore.
	 
	When the student has a sibling attending school in the receiving District, to avoid splitting the family's attendance
	 
	To meet the student's special mental or physical health needs as certified by a physician, school psychologist, or other appropriate person verifying health-related issues; or police or school report supporting safety related issues. 
	 
	When there is valid interest in a particular educational program not offered in the district of residence
	 
	To allow the student continuing enrollment, and the student has had positive attendance, appropriate behavior and appropriate academic progress and effort.
	 
	When the parent/guardian provides written evidence that the family will be moving into the District in the immediate future and would like the student to start the school year in the District


The Superintendent or designee may deny initial requests for interdistrict attendance permits due to limited District resources, overcrowding of school facilities at the relevant grade level, or other considerations that are not arbitrary.  However, once a student is admitted, the District shall not deny continued attendance because of overcrowded facilities at the relevant grade level.

If the transfer request is for a school year that begins within 15 calendar days of the receipt of the request, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the parent/guardian of the final decision within 30 calendar days of receiving the request. If the transfer request is for a school year that begins more than 15 calendar days after the receipt of the request, the parent/guardian shall be notified of the final decision as soon as possible, but no later than 14 calendar days after the commencement of instruction during that school year.  (Education Code 46600.2)

If a student's interdistrict transfer request is denied, the Superintendent or designee shall, in writing, notify the parents/guardians of their right to appeal to the County Board of Education within 30 calendar days from the date of the final denial.  (Education Code 46600.2)

All notices to parents/guardians regarding the District's decision on any request for interdistrict transfer shall conform to the translation requirements of Education Code 48985 and may be provided by regular mail, electronic format if the parent/guardian provides an email address, or by any other method normally used to communicate with parents/guardians in writing.  (Education Code 46600.2)

Students who are under consideration for expulsion or who have been expelled may not appeal interdistrict attendance denials or rescissions while expulsion proceedings are pending or during the term of the expulsion.  (Education Code 46601)

Once a student is admitted to a school on the basis of an interdistrict attendance permit, the student shall not be required to reapply for an interdistrict transfer and shall be allowed to continue to attend the school of enrollment except:


	Any student transitioning from an elementary school to a middle school, a K-8 school to a high school, and a middle school to a high school must reapply for a new interdistrict permit.
	 
	Any student residing outside of Alameda County must reapply for a new interdistrict permit annually. unless reapplication standards are otherwise specified in the interdistrict attendance agreement. Existing interdistrict attendance permits shall not be rescinded after June 30 following a student's completion of grade 10 or for any student entering grade 11 or 12 in the subsequent school year, except for the following reasons:
	 
	
		Excessive tardies, or absences from school, or is brought to school excessively early or left excessively late
		 
		Student fails to uphold appropriate behavior standards
		 
		Student fails to make appropriate academic efforts.
		 
		False or misleading information is provided
		 
		Other conditions that occur that would render continuance unadvisable.
	
	


Transfers Out of the District
