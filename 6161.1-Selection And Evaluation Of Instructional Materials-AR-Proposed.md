## Policy Content

Review Process

The District's review process for evaluating instructional materials shall involve teachers in a substantial manner and shall encourage the participation of parents/guardians and community members in accordance with Education Code 60002. The review process may also involve administrators, other staff who have subject-matter expertise, and students as appropriate. The Superintendent or designee shall seek input from stakeholders with diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

If the District is considering the use of instructional materials for grades K-8 that have not been adopted by the State Board of Education (SBE), the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a majority of the participants in the District's review process are classroom teachers who are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials.  (Education Code 60210)

The Superintendent or designee may establish an advisory committee to conduct the review of instructional materials.

The Superintendent or designee shall present to the Board of Education recommendations for instructional materials and documentation that supports the recommendations.

All recommended instructional materials shall be available for public inspection at the District office.

When possible, the District may pilot instructional materials in a representative sample of classrooms for a specified period of time during a school year, in order to determine the extent to which the materials support the District's curricular goals and academic standards, and accurately reflect and value society's diversity. Feedback from teachers piloting the materials shall be made available to the Board before the materials are adopted.
