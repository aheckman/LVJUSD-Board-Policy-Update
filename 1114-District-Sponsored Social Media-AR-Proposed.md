## Policy Content

Definitions

Social media means any online platform for collaboration, interaction, or active participation, or that allows users to post content, including, but not limited to, social networking sites such as Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X/Twitter, SnapChat, YouTube, and LinkedIn.

An official District social media account is an account on a social media platform authorized by the Superintendent or designee.

An account that contains content related to the District or comments about District operations but that has not been created based on authorization or direction from the Superintendent or designee, such as an account created by a parent-teacher organization, booster club, or other school-connected organization or a student's or employee's personal account, is not an official District social media account.

School-level employees such as teachers and coaches shall obtain authorization from the school principal before creating an official social media account.

Guidelines for Content

Each official District social media account shall contain content that is useful and appropriate for all audiences.

District employees or agents in charge of posting or adding information to an official District social media account shall ensure that copyright laws are not violated in the use of material on official District social media accounts.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that official District social media accounts are regularly monitored. Staff members responsible for monitoring content may remove posts or even suspend users from interacting with the account only based on viewpoint-neutral considerations, such as lack of relation to the account's purpose or violation of board policies or administrative regulations.

Each official District social media account shall, as appropriate, prominently display a link to this regulation or a statement that includes Items #1-10, below:

	The purpose(s) of the account, such as providing information to a class, school community, athletic team, or student club; engaging with the public regarding District decisions and Board of Education meetings; and sharing information regarding employment opportunities with the District
	 
	Users shall use the site only for those intended purposes
	 
	The account is regularly monitored and any inappropriate interaction will be promptly removed, blocked, or similarly addressed. Inappropriate interactions include, but are not limited to, interactions that:
	 
	
		Are obscene, libelous, or so incite students as to create a clear and present danger of the commission of unlawful acts on District premises, violation of District or school rules, or substantial disruption to the District or school's orderly operation
		 
		Are not related to the stated purpose of the account, including, but not limited to, threats, comments of a commercial nature, political activity, and comments prohibited by board policies and administrative regulations
		 
	
	
	Users are expected to communicate in a respectful, courteous, and professional manner and are personally responsible for their use of the account
	 
	The District is not responsible for the content posted by other users or how other users interact with the account
	 
	The views and comments expressed by other users on the account belong to those users and do not necessarily reflect the views of the District
	 
	Any user's reference to a specific commercial product or service does not imply endorsement or recommendation of that product or service by the District
	 
	The individual(s) to contact regarding violation of District guidelines on the use of official District social media accounts
	 
	Violations may be reported to the appropriate social media platform, law enforcement, or other third parties, as appropriate
	 
	A user may be suspended from interacting with the account for one month upon three prior violations and for six months upon two prior one-month suspensions

Appropriate Use by District Employees

District employees who participate in official District social media accounts shall adhere to all applicable board policies and administrative regulations, including, but not limited to, professional standards related to interactions with students.

When appropriate, employees posting, replying, or otherwise interacting with the public outside of their professional duties or responsibilities on official District social media accounts shall identify themselves by name and District title and include a disclaimer stating that the views and opinions expressed in their post are theirs alone and do not necessarily represent those of the District or school.

All staff shall receive information about appropriate use of the official District social media accounts.
