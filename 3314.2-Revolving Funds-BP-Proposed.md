## Policy Content

The Board of Education has a fiduciary responsibility to effectively manage and safeguard the District's assets and resources.  All revolving cash funds shall be subject to the internal control procedures established by the District to prevent and detect fraud, financial impropriety, or irregularity and shall be maintained in accordance with law and the California School Accounting Manual.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide regular reports to the Board regarding the use of revolving funds and the results of any audits conducted on the funds.

Standard Revolving Cash Fund

Pursuant to Education Code 42800, the Board has adopted a resolution establishing a revolving cash fund for use by the chief accounting officer.  The fund shall be used only for the purposes specified in the Board's resolution which may include, but are not limited to, payment for services or supplies for which there is an urgent deadline or to reduce the need for issuing numerous small warrants.

The chief accounting officer shall be covered by an individual bond or insurance in the amounts specified in law.  He/she shall ensure that payments from the fund are for services or materials that are a legal charge against the District and that a receipt is obtained setting forth the date, payee, purpose of the expenditure, and amount expended.  (Education Code 41021, 42801, 42801.5, 42804)

The Board may at any time reduce or discontinue the revolving cash fund.  (Education Code 42805)

Pre-Payment Revolving Cash Fund

Pursuant to Education Code 42820, the Board has adopted a resolution establishing a pre-payment revolving cash fund for use by the individual so designated in the Board's resolution.

The fund shall be established in a bank or other institution whose deposits are federally insured and shall be within the maximum limit specified in law. (Education Code 42820)

The designated individual shall be authorized to make payments from the fund for purchases in the amount of $1,000 or less, including freight or tax.  He/she shall submit a monthly list of the payments to the Board for approval.  (Education Code 42821)

Any person who issues a check drawn on the fund shall be personally liable for the amount of the check if the expenditure is in violation of the District's rules and regulations with respect to the fund.  (Education Code 42821)

Alternative Revolving Cash Fund

Pursuant to Education Code 42810, the Board has adopted a resolution establishing a revolving cash fund for use by school principals and other administrative staff.  The fund shall be used for services or materials related to classroom instruction or to correct an error in a classified employee's salary pursuant to Education Code 45167, as specified in the Board's resolution.

The revolving cash fund for supplies shall be subject to the bonding provisions of Education Code 42801.

The principal or administrative staff member in whose name the revolving cash fund is created shall be responsible for all fund expenditures, subject to Board regulation.  (Education Code 42810)
