If that action requires the continuing presence of the student at school, the student shall be appropriately supervised during the class periods from which the student has been suspended.  (Education Code 48910)

As soon as possible after the teacher has suspended the student, the teacher shall ask the student's parent/guardian to attend a parent-teacher conference regarding the suspension.

The Superintendent, principal, or designee shall immediately suspend any student found at school or at a school activity away from school to have committed any of the acts listed in the Board policy under "Authority to Expel" for which a recommendation of expulsion is required.  (Education Code 48915(c))

The Superintendent, principal, or designee may impose a suspension for a first offense if it is determined that the student violated any of Items #1-5 listed under "Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades K-12" above or if the student's presence causes a danger to persons.  (Education Code 48900.5)

For all other offenses, a student may be suspended only when the Superintendent or principal has determined that other means of correction have failed to bring about proper conduct.  (Education Code 48900.5)

The District may count suspensions that occur while a student is enrolled in another school district toward the maximum number of days for which the student may be suspended in any school year.  (Education Code 48903, 48911, 48912)

These restrictions on the number of days of suspension shall not apply when the suspension is extended pending an expulsion.  (Education Code 48911)

Due Process Procedures for Suspension

Suspensions shall be imposed in accordance with the following procedures:

	Informal Conference: Suspension shall be preceded by an informal conference conducted by the Superintendent, principal, or designee with the student and, whenever practicable, the teacher, supervisor, or school employee who referred the student to the principal. At the conference, the student shall be informed of the reason for the disciplinary action, including the other means of correction that were attempted before the suspension as required pursuant to Education Code 48900.5, and the evidence against the student, and shall be given the opportunity to present the student's version and evidence in the student's defense.  (Education Code 48911)
	
	This conference may be omitted if the Superintendent, principal, or designee determines that an emergency situation exists involving a clear and present danger to the lives, safety, or health of students or school personnel. If a student is suspended without this conference, the student, the student's parent/guardian, or if the student is a foster youth, the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or if the student is an Indian child, the Indian child's tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker, shall be notified of the student's right to a conference and the right to return to school for the purpose of the conference. The conference shall be held within two school days, unless the student waives the right to it or is physically unable to attend for any reason. In such a case, the conference shall be held as soon as the student is physically able to return to school for the conference.  (Education Code 48911)
	 
	Administrative Actions: All requests for student suspension are to be processed by the principal or designee. A school employee shall report the suspension, including the name of the student and the cause for the suspension, to the Superintendent or designee.  (Education Code 48911)
	 
	Notice to Parents/Guardians: At the time of the suspension, a school employee shall make a reasonable effort to contact the parent/guardian, or if the student is a foster youth, the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or if the student is an Indian child, the Indian child's tribal social worker, and, if applicable, the county social worker, in person, by email, or by telephone. Whenever a student is suspended, the parent/guardian, or, if applicable, the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or the Indian child's tribal social worker and, if applicable, the county social worker, shall also be notified in writing of the suspension.  (Education Code 48911)
	
	This notice shall state the specific offense committed by the student.  (Education Code 48900.8)
	
	In addition, the notice shall state the date and time when the student may return to school.
	 
	Parent/Guardian Conference: Whenever a student is suspended, school officials may conduct a meeting with the parent/guardian to discuss the cause(s) and duration of the suspension, the school policy involved, and any other pertinent matter.  (Education Code 48914)
	
	If school officials request to meet with the parent/guardian, a foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or an Indian child's tribal social worker, and, if applicable, the county social worker, the notice may state that the law requires such individuals to respond to the request without delay. However, the student shall not be penalized for the failure of the parent/guardian, a foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or an Indian child's tribal social worker, and, if applicable, the county social worker, to attend such a conference. The student may not be denied reinstatement solely because such individuals failed to attend the conference.  (Education Code 48911)
	 
	Extension of Suspension: If the Board is considering the expulsion of a suspended student from any school or the suspension of a student for the balance of the semester from continuation school, the Superintendent or designee may, in writing, extend the suspension until such time as the Board has made a decision, provided the following requirements are followed:  (Education Code 48911)
	 
	
		The extension of the original period of suspension is preceded by notice of such extension with an offer to hold a conference concerning the extension, giving the student an opportunity to be heard
		
		This conference may be held in conjunction with a meeting requested by the student or parent/guardian to challenge the original suspension.
		 
		The Superintendent or designee determines, following a meeting in which the student and the student's parent/guardian were invited to participate, that the student's presence at the school or at an alternative school would endanger persons or property or threaten to disrupt the instructional process
		 
		If the student involved is a foster youth or Indian child, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the District's educational liaison of the need to invite the foster youth's educational rights holder, attorney and county social worker, or the Indian child's tribal social worker or, if applicable, the county social worker, to attend the meeting  (Education Code 48853.5, 48911, 48918.1)
		 
		If the student involved is a child or youth experiencing homelessness, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the District liaison for homeless students  (Education Code 48918.1)
		 
		In lieu of or in addition to suspending a student, the Superintendent, principal, or designee may provide services or require the student to participate in an alternative disciplinary program designed to correct the behavior and keep the student in school

If a hearing that involves a charge of sexual assault or sexual battery is to be conducted in public, a complaining witness shall have the right to testify in closed session when testifying in public would threaten serious psychological harm to the witness and when there are no alternative procedures to avoid the threatened harm, including, but not limited to, a videotaped deposition or contemporaneous examination in another place communicated to the hearing room by closed-circuit television.  (Education Code 48918(c)


	Record of Hearing: A record of the hearing shall be made and may be maintained by any means, including electronic recording, as long as a reasonably accurate and complete written transcription of the proceedings can be made.  (Education Code 48918(g))
	 
	Subpoenas: Before commencing a student expulsion hearing, the Board may issue subpoenas, at the request of either the student or the Superintendent or designee, for the personal appearance at the hearing of any person who actually witnessed the action that gave rise to the recommendation for expulsion. After the hearing has commenced, the Board or the hearing officer or administrative panel may issue such subpoenas at the request of the student or the County Superintendent of Schools or designee. All subpoenas shall be issued in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure 1985-1985.2 and enforced in accordance with Government Code 11455.20.  (Education Code 48918(i))
	
	Any objection raised by the student or the Superintendent or designee to the issuance of subpoenas may be considered by the Board in closed session, or in open session if so requested by the student, before the meeting. The Board's decision in response to such an objection shall be final and binding.  (Education Code 48918(i))
	
	If the Board determines, or if the hearing officer or administrative panel finds and submits to the Board, that a witness would be subject to unreasonable risk of harm by testifying at the hearing, a subpoena shall not be issued to compel the personal attendance of that witness at the hearing. However, that witness may be compelled to testify by means of a sworn declaration as described in Item #6 below.  (Education Code 48918(i))
	 
	Presentation of Evidence: Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to the expulsion hearing, but relevant evidence may be admitted and used as proof only if it is the kind of evidence on which reasonable persons can rely in the conduct of serious affairs. The decision of the Board to expel shall be supported by substantial evidence that the student committed any of the acts pursuant to Education Code 48900 and listed in "Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades K-12," and "Additional Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades 4-12," above.  (Education Code 48918(h))
	 


Findings of fact shall be based solely on the evidence at the hearing. Although no finding shall be based solely on hearsay, sworn declarations may be admitted as testimony from witnesses whose disclosure of their identity or testimony at the hearing may subject them to an unreasonable risk of physical or psychological harm.  (Education Code 48918(f))
 

In cases where a search of a student's person or property has occurred, evidence describing the reasonableness of the search shall be included in the hearing record.


	Testimony by Complaining Witnesses: The following procedures shall be observed when a hearing involves allegations of sexual assault or sexual battery by a student:  (Education Code 48918, 48918.5)
	 
	
		Any complaining witness shall be given five days' notice before being called to testify
		 
		Any complaining witness shall be entitled to have up to two adult support persons, including, but not limited to, a parent/guardian or legal counsel, present during the testimony
		 
		Before a complaining witness testifies, support persons shall be admonished that the hearing is confidential
		 
		The person presiding over the hearing may remove a support person who is disrupting the hearing
		 
		If one or both support persons are also witnesses, the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Penal Code 868.5
		 
		Evidence of specific instances of prior sexual conduct of a complaining witness shall be presumed inadmissible and shall not be heard unless the person conducting the hearing determines that extraordinary circumstances require the evidence to be heard
		
		Before such a determination is made, the complaining witness shall be given notice and an opportunity to oppose the introduction of this evidence. In the hearing on the admissibility of this evidence, the complaining witness shall be entitled to be represented by a parent/guardian, legal counsel, or other support person. Reputation or opinion evidence regarding the sexual behavior of a complaining witness shall not be admissible for any purpose.
		 
		In order to facilitate a free and accurate statement of the experiences of the complaining witness and to prevent discouragement of complaints, the District shall provide a nonthreatening environment
		 
		
			The District shall provide a room separate from the hearing room for the use of the complaining witness before and during breaks in testimony
			 
			At the discretion of the person conducting the hearing, the complaining witness shall be allowed reasonable periods of relief from examination and cross-examination during which the complaining witness may leave the hearing room
			 
			The person conducting the hearing may:
			 
			
				Arrange the seating within the hearing room so as to facilitate a less intimidating environment for the complaining witness
				 
				Limit the time for taking the testimony of a complaining witness to normal school hours, if there is no good cause to take the testimony during other hours

	Decision: The Board's decision as to whether to expel a student shall be made within 40 school days after the student is removed from school, unless the student requests in writing that the decision be postponed.  (Education Code 48918(a))

Alternative Expulsion Hearing: Hearing Officer or Administrative Panel

Instead of conducting an expulsion hearing itself, the Board may contract with the county hearing officer or with the Office of Administrative Hearings of the State of California for a hearing officer. The Board may also appoint an impartial administrative panel composed of three or more certificated personnel, none of whom shall be members of the Board or on the staff of the school in which the student is enrolled.  (Education Code 48918)

A hearing conducted by the hearing officer or administrative panel shall conform to the same procedures applicable to a hearing conducted by the Board as specified above in "Conduct of Expulsion Hearing," including the requirement to issue a decision within 40 school days of the student's removal from school, unless the student requests that the decision be postponed.  (Education Code 48918(a) and (d))

The hearing officer or administrative panel shall, within three school days after the hearing, determine whether to recommend expulsion of the student to the Board. If expulsion is not recommended, the expulsion proceeding shall be terminated and the student shall be immediately reinstated and permitted to return to the classroom instructional program from which the referral was made, unless another placement is requested in writing by the student's parent/guardian. Before the student's placement decision is made by the student's parent/guardian, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the parent/guardian and District staff, including the student's teachers, regarding other placement options for the student in addition to the option to return to the classroom instructional program from which the student's expulsion referral was made. The decision to not recommend expulsion shall be final.  (Education Code 48918(e))

If expulsion is recommended, findings of fact in support of the recommendation shall be prepared and submitted to the Board. All findings of fact and recommendations shall be based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing. The Board may accept the recommendation based either upon a review of the findings of fact and recommendations submitted or upon the results of any supplementary hearing the Board may order.  (Education Code 48918(f))

In accordance with Board policy, the hearing officer or administrative panel may recommend that the Board suspend the enforcement of the expulsion. If the hearing officer or administrative panel recommends that the Board expel a student but suspend the enforcement of the expulsion, the student shall not be reinstated and permitted to return to the classroom instructional program from which the referral was made until the Board has ruled on the recommendation.  (Education Code 48917, 48918)

Final Action by the Board

Whether the expulsion hearing is conducted in closed or open session by the Board, a hearing officer, or an administrative panel or is waived through the signing of a stipulated expulsion agreement, the final action to expel shall be taken by the Board in public.  (Education Code 48918(j))

The Board's decision is final. If the decision is to not expel, the student shall be reinstated immediately. If the decision is to suspend the enforcement of the expulsion, the student shall be reinstated under the conditions of the suspended expulsion.

Upon ordering an expulsion, the Board shall set a date when the student shall be reviewed for readmission to a school within the District. For a student expelled for any "mandatory recommendation and mandatory expulsion" act listed in "Authority to Expel" in the accompanying Board policy, this date shall be one year from the date the expulsion occurred, except that the Board may set an earlier date on a case-by-case basis. For a student expelled for other acts, this date shall be no later than the last day of the semester following the semester in which the expulsion occurred. If an expulsion is ordered during summer session or the intersession period of a year-round program, the Board shall set a date when the student shall be reviewed for readmission not later than the last day of the semester following the summer session or intersession period in which the expulsion occurred.  (Education Code 48916)

At the time of the expulsion order, the Board shall recommend a plan for the student's rehabilitation, which may include:  (Education Code 48916)

	Periodic review, as well as assessment at the time of review, for readmission
	 
	Recommendations for improved academic performance, tutoring, special education assessments, job training, counseling, employment, community service, or other rehabilitative programs

With parent/guardian consent, students who have been expelled for reasons relating to controlled substances or alcohol may be required to enroll in a county-sponsored drug rehabilitation program before returning to school.  (Education Code 48916.5)

Written Notice to Expel

The Superintendent or designee shall send written notice of the decision to expel to the student or parent/guardian. This notice shall include the following:

	The specific offense committed by the student for any of the causes for suspension or expulsion listed above under "Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades K-12" or "Additional Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades 4-12"  (Education Code 48900.8)
	 
	The fact that a description of readmission procedures will be made available to the student and parent/guardian  (Education Code 48916)

Decision to Suspend Expulsion Order

In accordance with Board policy, when deciding whether to suspend the enforcement of an expulsion order, the Board shall take into account the following criteria:

	The student's pattern of behavior
	 
	The seriousness of the misconduct
	 
	The student's attitude toward the misconduct and willingness to follow a rehabilitation program

The suspension of the enforcement of an expulsion shall be governed by the following:


	The Board may, as a condition of the suspension of enforcement, assign the student to a school, class, or program appropriate for the student's rehabilitation
	
	This rehabilitation program may provide for the involvement of the student's parent/guardian in the student's education. However, a parent/guardian's refusal to participate in the rehabilitation program shall not be considered in the Board's determination as to whether the student has satisfactorily completed the rehabilitation program.  (Education Code 48917)
	 
	During the period when enforcement of the expulsion order is suspended, the student shall be on probationary status  (Education Code 48917)
	 
	The suspension of the enforcement of an expulsion order may be revoked by the Board if the student commits any of the acts listed under "Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades K-12" or "Additional Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades 4-12" above, or violates any of the District's rules and regulations governing student conduct  (Education Code 48917)
	 
	When the suspension of enforcement of an expulsion order is revoked, a student may be expelled under the terms of the original expulsion order  (Education Code 48917)
	 
	Upon satisfactory completion of the rehabilitation assignment, the Board shall reinstate the student in a District school
	
	Upon reinstatement, the Board may order the expunging of any or all records of the expulsion proceedings.  (Education Code 48917)
	 
	The Superintendent or designee shall send written notice of any decision to suspend the enforcement of an expulsion order during a period of probation to the student or parent/guardian
	
	The notice shall inform the parent/guardian of the right to appeal the expulsion to the County Board, the alternative educational placement to be provided to the student during the period of expulsion, and the student's or parent/guardian's obligation to inform any new district in which the student seeks to enroll of the student's status with the expelling district, pursuant to Education Code 48915.1(b).  (Education Code 48918(j))
	 
	Suspension of the enforcement of an expulsion order shall not affect the time period and requirements for the filing of an appeal of the expulsion order with the County Board  (Education Code 48917)

Appeal

If a student is expelled from school, the student or parent/guardian is entitled to file an appeal of the Board's decision with the County Board. The appeal must be filed within 30 days of the Board's decision to expel, even if the expulsion order is suspended and the student is placed on probation.  (Education Code 48919)

If the student submits a written request for a copy of the written transcripts and supporting documents from the District simultaneously with the filing of the notice of appeal with the County Board, the District shall provide the student with these documents within 10 school days following the student's written request.  (Education Code 48919)

Within one school day after a student's suspension or expulsion, the principal or designee shall notify appropriate county or District law enforcement authorities, by telephone or other appropriate means, of any student acts which may violate Education Code 48900(c) or (d), relating to the possession, use, offering, or sale of controlled substances, alcohol, or intoxicants of any kind.  (Education Code 48902)

	The Superintendent or designee shall transmit to the Board a recommendation regarding readmission
	
	The Board shall consider this recommendation in closed session.

<br>
When suspending a student from class, the teacher shall immediately report this action to the principal or designee and send the student to the principal or designee for appropriate action. If that action requires the continuing presence of the student at school, the student shall be appropriately supervised during the class periods from which the student has been suspended.&nbsp; (Education Code 48910)<br>
<br>
As soon as possible after the teacher has suspended the student, the teacher shall ask the student&#39;s parent/guardian to attend a parent-teacher conference regarding the suspension.

However, if a student enrolls in or is transferred to another regular school, an opportunity school or class, or continuation school or class for the purpose of adjustment, the student may be suspended for not more than 30 school days in a school year. The District may count suspensions that occur while a student is enrolled in another school district toward the maximum number of days for which the student may be suspended in any school year.&nbsp; (Education Code 48903, 48911, 48912)<br>
<br>
These restrictions on the number of days of suspension shall not apply when the suspension is extended pending an expulsion.&nbsp; (Education Code 48911)<br>
<br>
<strong>Due Process Procedures for Suspension</strong><br>
<br>
Suspensions shall be imposed in accordance with the following procedures:
<ol>
	<li>Informal Conference: Suspension shall be preceded by an informal conference conducted by the Superintendent, principal, or designee with the student and, whenever practicable, the teacher, supervisor, or school employee who referred the student to the principal. At the conference, the student shall be informed of the reason for the disciplinary action, including the other means of correction that were attempted before the suspension as required pursuant to Education Code 48900.5, and the evidence against the student, and shall be given the opportunity to present the student&#39;s version and evidence in the student&#39;s defense.&nbsp; (Education Code 48911)<br>
	<br>
	This conference may be omitted if the Superintendent, principal, or designee determines that an emergency situation exists involving a clear and present danger to the lives, safety, or health of students or school personnel. If a student is suspended without this conference, the student, the student&#39;s parent/guardian, or if the student is a foster youth, the foster youth&#39;s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or if the student is an Indian child, the Indian child&#39;s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker, shall be notified of the student&#39;s right to a conference and the right to return to school for the purpose of the conference. The conference shall be held within two school days, unless the student waives the right to it or is physically unable to attend for any reason. In such a case, the conference shall be held as soon as the student is physically able to return to school for the conference.&nbsp; (Education Code 48911)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Administrative Actions: All requests for student suspension are to be processed by the principal or designee. A school employee shall report the suspension, including the name of the student and the cause for the suspension, to the Superintendent or designee.&nbsp; (Education Code 48911)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Notice to Parents/Guardians: At the time of the suspension, a school employee shall make a reasonable effort to contact the parent/guardian, or if the student is a foster youth, the foster youth&#39;s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or if the student is an Indian child, the Indian child&#39;s tribal social worker, and, if applicable, the county social worker, in person, by email, or by telephone. Whenever a student is suspended, the parent/guardian, or, if applicable, the foster youth&#39;s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or the Indian child&#39;s tribal social worker and, if applicable, the county social worker, shall also be notified in writing of the suspension.&nbsp; (Education Code 48911)<br>
	<br>
	This notice shall state the specific offense committed by the student.&nbsp; (Education Code 48900.8)<br>
	<br>
	In addition, the notice shall state the date and time when the student may return to school.<br>

	<br>
	If school officials request to meet with the parent/guardian, a foster youth&#39;s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or an Indian child&#39;s tribal social worker, and, if applicable, the county social worker, the notice may state that the law requires such individuals to respond to the request without delay. However, the student shall not be penalized for the failure of the parent/guardian, a foster youth&#39;s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or an Indian child&#39;s tribal social worker, and, if applicable, the county social worker, to attend such a conference. The student may not be denied reinstatement solely because such individuals failed to attend the conference.&nbsp; (Education Code 48911)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Extension of Suspension: If the Board is considering the expulsion of a suspended student from any school or the suspension of a student for the balance of the semester from continuation school, the Superintendent or designee may, in writing, extend the suspension until such time as the Board has made a decision, provided the following requirements are followed:&nbsp; (Education Code 48911)<br>
	&nbsp;
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>The extension of the original period of suspension is preceded by notice of such extension with an offer to hold a conference concerning the extension, giving the student an opportunity to be heard<br>
		<br>

		&nbsp;</li>

<br>
<strong>Student&#39;s Right to Expulsion Hearing</strong><br>

	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<div style="margin-left:40px">Findings of fact shall be based solely on the evidence at the hearing. Although no finding shall be based solely on hearsay, sworn declarations may be admitted as testimony from witnesses whose disclosure of their identity or testimony at the hearing may subject them to an unreasonable risk of physical or psychological harm.&nbsp; (Education Code 48918(f))<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px">In cases where a search of a student&#39;s person or property has occurred, evidence describing the reasonableness of the search shall be included in the hearing record.</div>

	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>Any complaining witness shall be given five days&#39; notice before being called to testify<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Any complaining witness shall be entitled to have up to two adult support persons, including, but not limited to, a parent/guardian or legal counsel, present during the testimony<br>

		<li>Evidence of specific instances of prior sexual conduct of a complaining witness shall be presumed inadmissible and shall not be heard unless the person conducting the hearing determines that extraordinary circumstances require the evidence to be heard<br>
		<br>
		Before such a determination is made, the complaining witness shall be given notice and an opportunity to oppose the introduction of this evidence. In the hearing on the admissibility of this evidence, the complaining witness shall be entitled to be represented by a parent/guardian, legal counsel, or other support person. Reputation or opinion evidence regarding the sexual behavior of a complaining witness shall not be admissible for any purpose.<br>

	<li>Decision: The Board&#39;s decision as to whether to expel a student shall be made within 40 school days after the student is removed from school, unless the student requests in writing that the decision be postponed.&nbsp; (Education Code 48918(a))</li>
</ol>
<strong>Alternative Expulsion Hearing: Hearing Officer or Administrative Panel</strong><br>
<br>
Instead of conducting an expulsion hearing itself, the Board may contract with the county hearing officer or with the Office of Administrative Hearings of the State of California for a hearing officer. The Board may also appoint an impartial administrative panel composed of three or more certificated personnel, none of whom shall be members of the Board or on the staff of the school in which the student is enrolled.&nbsp; (Education Code 48918)<br>
<br>
A hearing conducted by the hearing officer or administrative panel shall conform to the same procedures applicable to a hearing conducted by the Board as specified above in &quot;Conduct of Expulsion Hearing,&quot; including the requirement to issue a decision within 40 school days of the student&#39;s removal from school, unless the student requests that the decision be postponed.&nbsp; (Education Code 48918(a) and (d))<br>
<br>
The hearing officer or administrative panel shall, within three school days after the hearing, determine whether to recommend expulsion of the student to the Board. If expulsion is not recommended, the expulsion proceeding shall be terminated and the student shall be immediately reinstated and permitted to return to the classroom instructional program from which the referral was made, unless another placement is requested in writing by the student&#39;s parent/guardian. Before the student&#39;s placement decision is made by the student&#39;s parent/guardian, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the parent/guardian and District staff, including the student&#39;s teachers, regarding other placement options for the student in addition to the option to return to the classroom instructional program from which the student&#39;s expulsion referral was made. The decision to not recommend expulsion shall be final.&nbsp; (Education Code 48918(e))<br>
<br>
If expulsion is recommended, findings of fact in support of the recommendation shall be prepared and submitted to the Board. All findings of fact and recommendations shall be based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing. The Board may accept the recommendation based either upon a review of the findings of fact and recommendations submitted or upon the results of any supplementary hearing the Board may order.&nbsp; (Education Code 48918(f))<br>
<br>
In accordance with Board policy, the hearing officer or administrative panel may recommend that the Board suspend the enforcement of the expulsion. If the hearing officer or administrative panel recommends that the Board expel a student but suspend the enforcement of the expulsion, the student shall not be reinstated and permitted to return to the classroom instructional program from which the referral was made until the Board has ruled on the recommendation.&nbsp; (Education Code 48917, 48918)<br>
<br>
<strong>Final Action by the Board</strong><br>
<br>
Whether the expulsion hearing is conducted in closed or open session by the Board, a hearing officer, or an administrative panel or is waived through the signing of a stipulated expulsion agreement, the final action to expel shall be taken by the Board in public.&nbsp; (Education Code 48918(j))<br>
<br>
The Board&#39;s decision is final. If the decision is to not expel, the student shall be reinstated immediately. If the decision is to suspend the enforcement of the expulsion, the student shall be reinstated under the conditions of the suspended expulsion.<br>
<br>
Upon ordering an expulsion, the Board shall set a date when the student shall be reviewed for readmission to a school within the District. For a student expelled for any &quot;mandatory recommendation and mandatory expulsion&quot; act listed in &quot;Authority to Expel&quot; in the accompanying Board policy, this date shall be one year from the date the expulsion occurred, except that the Board may set an earlier date on a case-by-case basis. For a student expelled for other acts, this date shall be no later than the last day of the semester following the semester in which the expulsion occurred. If an expulsion is ordered during summer session or the intersession period of a year-round program, the Board shall set a date when the student shall be reviewed for readmission not later than the last day of the semester following the summer session or intersession period in which the expulsion occurred.&nbsp; (Education Code 48916)<br>
<br>
At the time of the expulsion order, the Board shall recommend a plan for the student&#39;s rehabilitation, which may include:&nbsp; (Education Code 48916)
<ol>
	<li>Periodic review, as well as assessment at the time of review, for readmission<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Recommendations for improved academic performance, tutoring, special education assessments, job training, counseling, employment, community service, or other rehabilitative programs</li>
</ol>
With parent/guardian consent, students who have been expelled for reasons relating to controlled substances or alcohol may be required to enroll in a county-sponsored drug rehabilitation program before returning to school.&nbsp; (Education Code 48916.5)<br>
<br>
<strong>Written Notice to Expel</strong><br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall send written notice of the decision to expel to the student or parent/guardian. This notice shall include the following:
<ol>
	<li>The specific offense committed by the student for any of the causes for suspension or expulsion listed above under &quot;Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades K-12&quot; or &quot;Additional Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades 4-12&quot;&nbsp; (Education Code 48900.8)<br>

	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Notice of the student&#39;s or parent/guardian&#39;s obligation to inform any new district in which the student seeks to enroll of the student&#39;s status with the expelling district, pursuant to Education Code 48915.1&nbsp; (Education Code 48918)</li>
</ol>
<strong>Decision to Suspend Expulsion Order</strong><br>
<br>
In accordance with Board policy, when deciding whether to suspend the enforcement of an expulsion order, the Board shall take into account the following criteria:
<ol>
	<li>The student&#39;s pattern of behavior<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The seriousness of the misconduct<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The student&#39;s attitude toward the misconduct and willingness to follow a rehabilitation program</li>
</ol>
The suspension of the enforcement of an expulsion shall be governed by the following:

<ol>
	<li>The Board may, as a condition of the suspension of enforcement, assign the student to a school, class, or program appropriate for the student&#39;s rehabilitation<br>
	<br>
	This rehabilitation program may provide for the involvement of the student&#39;s parent/guardian in the student&#39;s education. However, a parent/guardian&#39;s refusal to participate in the rehabilitation program shall not be considered in the Board&#39;s determination as to whether the student has satisfactorily completed the rehabilitation program.&nbsp; (Education Code 48917)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>During the period when enforcement of the expulsion order is suspended, the student shall be on probationary status&nbsp; (Education Code 48917)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The suspension of the enforcement of an expulsion order may be revoked by the Board if the student commits any of the acts listed under &quot;Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades K-12&quot; or &quot;Additional Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion: Grades 4-12&quot; above, or violates any of the District&#39;s rules and regulations governing student conduct&nbsp; (Education Code 48917)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>When the suspension of enforcement of an expulsion order is revoked, a student may be expelled under the terms of the original expulsion order&nbsp; (Education Code 48917)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Upon satisfactory completion of the rehabilitation assignment, the Board shall reinstate the student in a District school<br>
	<br>
	Upon reinstatement, the Board may order the expunging of any or all records of the expulsion proceedings.&nbsp; (Education Code 48917)<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Superintendent or designee shall send written notice of any decision to suspend the enforcement of an expulsion order during a period of probation to the student or parent/guardian<br>
	<br>
	The notice shall inform the parent/guardian of the right to appeal the expulsion to the County Board, the alternative educational placement to be provided to the student during the period of expulsion, and the student&#39;s or parent/guardian&#39;s obligation to inform any new district in which the student seeks to enroll of the student&#39;s status with the expelling district, pursuant to Education Code 48915.1(b).&nbsp; (Education Code 48918(j))<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Suspension of the enforcement of an expulsion order shall not affect the time period and requirements for the filing of an appeal of the expulsion order with the County Board&nbsp; (Education Code 48917)</li>
</ol>
<strong>Appeal</strong><br>
<br>
If a student is expelled from school, the student or parent/guardian is entitled to file an appeal of the Board&#39;s decision with the County Board. The appeal must be filed within 30 days of the Board&#39;s decision to expel, even if the expulsion order is suspended and the student is placed on probation.&nbsp; (Education Code 48919)<br>
<br>
If the student submits a written request for a copy of the written transcripts and supporting documents from the District simultaneously with the filing of the notice of appeal with the County Board, the District shall provide the student with these documents within 10 school days following the student&#39;s written request.&nbsp; (Education Code 48919)<br>
<br>
<strong>Notification to Law Enforcement Authorities</strong><br>
<br>
Prior to the suspension or expulsion of any student, the principal or designee shall notify appropriate city or county law enforcement authorities of any student acts of assault which may have violated Penal Code 245.&nbsp; (Education Code 48902)<br>
<br>
The principal or designee shall notify appropriate city or county law enforcement authorities of any student acts which may involve the possession or sale of narcotics or of a controlled substance, or of any student acts involving the possession, sale, or furnishing of firearms, explosives, or other dangerous weapons in violation of Education Code 48915(c)(1) or (5) or Penal Code 626.9 and 626.10.&nbsp; (Education Code 48902)<br>
