Exemptions from District-Adopted Graduation Requirements

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.1 requires the district to exempt from any district-adopted graduation requirements that are in addition to the state requirements specified in Education Code 51225.3 a foster youth, a student experiencing homelessness, a former juvenile court school student, a child of a military family, a migrant student who transfers into the district or between district high schools any time after completing the second year of high school, or, as amended by AB 714 (Ch. 342, Statutes of 2023), a newcomer student as defined in Education Code 51225.2 who is in the third or fourth year of high school. This exemption does not apply if the Superintendent or designee makes a finding that the student is reasonably able to complete the requirements in time to graduate by the end of the fourth year of high school. Also see AR 6173 - Education for Homeless Children, AR 6173.1 - Education for Foster Youth, AR 6173.2 - Education of Children of Military Families, AR 6173.3 - Education for Juvenile Court School Students, and AR 6175 - Migrant Education Program.Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, within 30 calendar days of the transfer into a school by a foster youth, student experiencing homelessness, former juvenile court school student, child of a military family, migrant student,  or newcomer student, as applicable, the district is required to notify any eligible student and/or the student's parent/guardian, the student's educational rights holder, the district's liaison for homeless children, and the student's social worker or probation officer, as applicable, of the availability of the exemption from local graduation requirements and whether the student qualifies for it. If the district fails to provide that notification, the student will be eligible for the exemption once notified, even if the notification is received after the termination of the court's jurisdiction over the foster youth or former juvenile court school student, after the student experiencing homelessness ceases to be homeless, or after the student no longer meets the definition of a child of a military family, a migrant student, or a newcomer student, as applicable.Education Code 51225.1 also provides that, if an exempted student completes the statewide coursework requirements before the end of the fourth year of high school, the district or a district school must not require or request that the student graduate before the end of the fourth year of high school.Any complaint alleging the district's failure to comply with the requirements of Education Code 51225.1 may be filed using the district's uniform complaint procedures pursuant to 5 CCR 4600-4670.  See BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.
A foster youth, student experiencing homelessness, former juvenile court school student, child of a military family, migrant student who transfers into the district or between district schools any time after completing the second year of high school, or newcomer student who is in the third or fourth year of high school shall be exempted from any graduation requirements adopted by the Board that are in addition to statewide course requirements. This exemption shall not apply if the Superintendent or designee makes a finding that the student is reasonably able to complete the additional requirements in time to graduate by the end of the fourth year of high school.

Within 30 days of the transfer into a school by the foster youth, student experiencing homelessness, former juvenile court school student, child of a military family, migrant student, or  newcomer student, as applicable, the Superintendent or designee shall notify any eligible student, and others as required by law, of the availability of the exemption from local graduation requirements and whether the student qualifies for it.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, the district may not require or request a foster youth, student experiencing homelessness, former juvenile court school student, child of a military family, migrant student, or newcomer student who is exempted from district-established graduation requirements and completes statewide coursework requirements before the end of the student's fourth year of high school to graduate early, as described below.
The Superintendent or designee shall not require or request the foster youth, student experiencing homelessness, former juvenile court school student, child of a military family, migrant student, or  newcomer student who is exempted from district-established graduation requirements and who completes the statewide coursework requirements before the end of the fourth year of high school, and would otherwise be entitled to remain in school, to graduate before the end of the student's fourth year of high school.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532 (Ch. 918, Statutes of 2022), requires the district to exempt a foster youth, student experiencing homelessness, former juvenile court school student, child of a military family, migrant student, or newcomer student who qualifies for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements, under the circumstances described below.
If the foster youth, student experiencing homelessness, former juvenile court school student, child of a military family, migrant student, or newcomer student was not properly notified of an exemption, declined the exemption, or was not previously exempted, the student or the student's educational rights holder may request the exemption and the Superintendent or designee shall exempt the student within 30 days of the request. Any such student who at one time qualified for the exemption may request the exemption even if the student is no longer eligible.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.31, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023) and SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), districts are required to exempt an eligible student with disabilities, that entered the ninth grade in the 2022-23 school year and later, from all coursework and other requirements adopted by the Board that are in addition to the statewide course requirements specified in Education Code 51225.3, and award such student a high school diploma, as reflected below. Awarding a diploma pursuant to this exception does not change the district's obligation to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) until 22 years of age or otherwise constitute a change in placement.
Additionally, a student with disabilities shall be eligible for an exemption from all coursework and other requirements adopted by the Board in addition to the statewide course requirements for high school graduation, if the student's individualized education program (IEP) provides for both of the following requirements:  (Education Code 51225.31)

	That the student is eligible to take the alternate assessment as described in Education Code 60640
	 
	That the student complete state standards aligned coursework to meet the statewide coursework specified in Education Code 51225.3

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.31, as amended by SB 114  and SB 141, participation in graduation activities by a student with a disability who is exempted from district-adopted graduation requirements that are in addition to the statewide course requirements specified in Education Code 51225.3, may not be construed as a termination of the district's responsibility to provide FAPE unless the student's individualized education program team, which includes the parent/guardian and student, has determined that the student has completed the high school experience.
The district's responsibility to provide a free appropriate public education shall not terminate when a student with a disability who is exempted from district- adopted graduation requirements participates in graduation activities unless the IEP team, which includes the parent/guardian and student, has determined that the student has completed the high school experience.  (Education Code 51225.31)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532, districts are required to annually report to the California Department of Education (CDE) regarding the number of students who, for the prior school year, graduated with an exemption from the district-established graduation requirements that are in addition to statewide coursework requirements, as specified below.Pursuant to Education Code 60900.2, as added by AB 1340 (Ch. 576, Statutes of 2023), and contingent upon funding for these purposes, CDE is required, on or before January 1, 2025, to report on its website statewide four and five year cohort graduation rates for students with disabilities disaggregated by the identified disability or disabilities as listed in 34 CFR 300.8.
Annually, the Superintendent or designee shall report to the California Department of Education, in accordance with Education Code 51225.1, the number of student's graduating from the fourth or fifth year of high school who, for the prior school year, graduated with an exemption from district-established graduation requirements that are in addition to statewide coursework requirements.

Retroactive Diplomas

Any student who completed grade 12 in the 2003-04 through 2014-15 school year and met all applicable graduation requirements other than the passage of the high school exit examination shall be granted a high school diploma.  (Education Code 51413)

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-5 below are optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
In addition, the district may retroactively grant high school diplomas to former students who:  (Education Code 48204.4, 51430, 51440)

	Departed California against their will while in grade 12 and did not receive a diploma because the departure interrupted their education, provided that they were in good academic standing at the time of the departure
	
	Persons may be considered to have departed California against their will if they were in custody of a government agency and were transferred to another state, were subject to a lawful order from a court or government agency that authorized their removal from California, were subject to a lawful order and were permitted to depart California before being removed from California pursuant to the lawful order, were removed or were permitted to depart voluntarily pursuant to the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, or departed due to other circumstances determined by the district that are consistent with the purposes of Education Code 48204.4.
	
	In determining whether to award a diploma under these circumstances, the Superintendent or designee shall consider any coursework that may have been completed outside of the U.S. or through online or virtual courses.
	 
	Were interned by order of the federal government during World War II or are honorably discharged veterans of World War II, the Korean War, or the Vietnam War, provided that they were enrolled in a district high school immediately preceding the internment or military service and did not receive a diploma because their education was interrupted due to the internment or military service in those wars
	
	Deceased former students who satisfy these conditions may be granted a retroactive diploma to be received by their next of kin.
	 
	Are veterans who entered the military service of the U.S. while in grade 12 and who had satisfactorily completed the first half of the work required for grade 12 in a district school
	 
	Are former members of the military, a resident of California, and received an honorable discharge, or, are current members of the military, a resident of California, and a resident of California when entering the military
	
	In determining whether to award a diploma under these circumstances, the Superintendent or designee shall evaluate classes completed in any high school, community college, or state college, grant credit toward graduation for military service and training received while in the military, and if satisfied that the person has completed the equivalent of the requirements for graduation from high school, grant the person a diploma of graduation.
	 
	Were in their senior year of high school during the 2019-20 school year, were in good academic standing and on track to graduate at the end of the 2019-20 school year as of March 1, 2020, and were unable to complete the statewide graduation requirements as a result of the COVID-19 crisis

Honorary Diplomas

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section reflects the Board's authority to confer honorary high school diplomas pursuant to Education Code 51225.5 and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Board may grant an honorary high school diploma to:  (Education Code 51225.5)

	An international exchange student who has not completed the course of study ordinarily required for graduation and who is returning to the student's home country following the completion of one academic school year in the district
	 
	A student who is terminally ill

The honorary diploma shall be clearly distinguishable from the regular diploma of graduation awarded by the district.  (Education Code 51225.5)
