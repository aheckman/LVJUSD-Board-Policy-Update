## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 35256 requires the Governing Board to annually issue a school accountability report card (SARC) for each school site, reporting all conditions listed in Education Code 33126 and 41409.3. The goal of the SARC is to provide data by which parents/guardians can make meaningful comparisons between schools, thus enabling them to make informed decisions regarding which school they wish their children to attend.In addition, pursuant to 20 USC 6311, any district that receives Title I, Part A funding is required to prepare and disseminate an annual report card which includes specified information. Districts are authorized, pursuant to 20 USC 6311, to incorporate the information required to be in the annual report card into the SARC, rather than issuing a separate district-level report card. For more information on requirements for schools that receive Title I funding, see BP/AR 6171 - Title I Programs.
The Governing Board recognizes its responsibility to inform parents/guardians and the community about the conditions, needs, and progress at each district school and to provide data by which parents/guardians can make meaningful comparisons between schools. The process of gathering and analyzing data also provides opportunities for school and district staff to review achievements and identify areas for improvement.

The Board shall annually issue a school accountability report card (SARC) for each school site.  (Education Code 35256)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 33126.1 requires that the California Department of Education (CDE) develop a standardized template for use by districts in creating their SARCs. This template is posted on CDE's website. The template lists the specific legal requirements and definitions, including federal Title I requirements for district report cards pursuant to 20 USC 6311, as well as references to help access the data.
In preparing the district's report cards, the Superintendent or designee may choose to use or adapt the model template provided by the California Department of Education. If the model template is not used, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that data is reported in a manner that is consistent with the definitions for school conditions as provided in the template. At least every three years, the Board shall compare the content of the district's SARCs to the state's model template, recognizing that variances are allowed by law as necessary to meet local needs.  (Education Code 33126.1, 35256)

The Board shall annually approve the SARCs for all district schools and shall evaluate the data contained in the SARCs as part of the Board's regular review of the effectiveness of the district's programs, personnel, and fiscal operations.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for communicating the information contained in the SARCs to all stakeholders, including opportunities for staff and the community to discuss their content.

Notification and Dissemination of SARCs

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35256 requires districts to notify parents/guardians about the availability of the SARC and to provide a paper copy of the SARC upon request. Pursuant to Education Code 35256 and 35258, districts are required to make the SARC available, in both hard copy and on their website as applicable, by February 1 of each year; some county offices of education make SARCs for district schools within the county available on their websites. Districts are not required to submit their SARCs to CDE, but are required by Education Code 33126.1 to ensure that CDE has the district's current SARC website address for linkage from CDE's website. Districts may submit SARCs by utilizing CDE's online electronic SARC template available on myCDEconnect accounts, which submits the entirety of the SARC to CDE. Districts may also elect not to use the template and instead use a myCDEconnect account to upload an accurate URL where the SARC has been posted on the school or district website. Both methods of submission fulfill the requirement pursuant to Education Code 33126.1.Additionally, 20 USC 6311 requires districts receiving Title I, Part A funds to disseminate the Title I report card information to all district schools and to all parents/guardians of students attending those schools. Pursuant to 20 USC 6311, the district's Title I report card must be concise; presented in an understandable and uniform format, and to the extent practicable, in a language that parents can understand; and be accessible to the public, including posting the report card on the district's website. Districts without a website may publicize the report card by providing the information to the public in another manner as determined by the district. CDE recommends that all parents/guardians be notified of the availability of the full report and be provided information as to how they can access the full report on the Internet or request a paper copy, and that districts make copies of the SARC available in the school office and at public forums, such as parent information nights.
Annually, on or before February 1 of each year, the Superintendent or designee shall publicize the issuance of the SARCs, make the SARCs available on the district's website, and notify parents/guardians that a hard copy shall be provided upon request.  (Education Code 33126, 35256, 35258)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48985, when 15 percent or more of students enrolled in a school speak a single primary language other than English, all notices and reports sent to the parents/guardians of these students must also be written in the primary language and may be answered by the parent/guardian in English or the primary language. In addition, 20 USC 6311 and 6312 require that districts receiving Title I funds provide parent/guardian notices in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, in a language that parents/guardians understand.
Additionally, when 15 percent or more of a school's students speak a single primary language other than English, the SARC shall be translated into that other language.  (Education Code 48985)

In addition, the SARC shall be provided in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, provided in a language that parents/guardians can understand.  (Education Code 33126, 35256; 20 USC 6311)
