## Policy Content

The Governing Board is committed to providing a safe environment for students, staff, and visitors on campus. The Superintendent or designee shall consult with local law enforcement and other appropriate individuals and agencies to address the security of school campuses.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Penal Code 626.9 (the Gun Free School Zone Act), the possession of a firearm on school grounds or within 1,000 feet of a school is prohibited, except by a person who meets one of the exceptions specified in law (e.g., is a law enforcement or honorably retired peace officer, a member of the military force engaged in the performance of his/her duties, a security guard, or a participant in an existing shooting range at a school or in a school-sanctioned shooting sport or activity). Another exception in Penal Code 626.9 allows a person with a valid Carry Concealed Weapon (CCW) license to carry a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. However, as amended by AB 424 (Ch. 779, Statutes of 2017), Penal Code 626.9 eliminates the authority of the Superintendent or designee to provide written permission for a person who holds a valid CCW license to possess a firearm on school grounds. 
Possession of a firearm on or within 1,000 feet of school grounds is prohibited, except under the limited circumstances specified in Penal Code 626.9. School grounds include, but are not limited to, school buildings, fields, storage areas, and parking lots.  (Penal Code 626.9)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48902 requires the principal or designee to notify law enforcement authorities when any student possesses a firearm or explosive or sells or furnishes a firearm at school. In addition, pursuant to 20 USC 7961, as renumbered by P.L. 114-95, districts are mandated to develop a policy to notify law enforcement whenever a student brings a firearm to school. For policy implementing this mandate, see BP 5131.7 - Weapons and Dangerous Instruments. The following paragraph requires that law enforcement be notified when any person, whether a student or nonstudent, is observed or suspected of possessing a firearm at school. 
If a district employee observes or suspects that any unauthorized person is in possession of a firearm on or near school grounds or at a school activity, he/she shall immediately notify the principal or designee and law enforcement.

The prohibition against the possession of firearms on school grounds shall be included in the district's comprehensive safety plan and shall be communicated to district staff, parents/guardians, and the community.
