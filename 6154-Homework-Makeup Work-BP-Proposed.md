## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that meaningful homework assignments can be a valuable extension of student learning time, provide enrichment, and assist students in developing good study habits. Homework and/or makeup work shall be assigned when necessary to support classroom lessons, enable students to complete unfinished assignments, or review and apply academic content for better understanding.

Students may use technology to assist with homework and/or makeup work in conducting research, correcting grammar and spelling, and learning from educational applications such as tutoring systems and language learning applications, as specified in Board Policy 5131.9 - Academic Honesty and Board Policy 6163.4 - Student Use of Technology.

The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with school administrators and teachers to develop and regularly review guidelines for the assignment of homework and the related responsibilities of students, staff, and parents/guardians.

Homework assignments shall be reasonable in length and appropriate to the grade level and course. The Board expects that the number, frequency, and degree of difficulty of homework assignments will increase with the grade level and the maturity of students. Teachers shall assign homework only as necessary to fulfill academic goals and reinforce current instruction.

As needed, teachers may receive training in designing relevant homework assignments that reinforce classroom learning objectives and inspire students' interests.

Although on-time completion of homework is important to maintain academic progress, the Board recognizes that students learn at different rates. Students shall receive credit for late work in order to encourage continued learning, provided the assignments are completed satisfactorily and within a reasonable timeframe after the deadline.

Age-appropriate instruction may be given to help students allocate their time wisely, meet their deadlines, learn to work independently, and develop good personal study habits.

At the beginning of the school year, teachers shall communicate homework expectations to students and their parents/guardians. Homework guidelines shall also be included in student and/or parent/guardian handbooks. These communications shall include the manner in which homework relates to achievement of academic standards and course content, the impact of homework assignments on students' grades, any school resources and programs that are available to provide homework support, and ways in which parents/guardians may appropriately assist their children.

Although it is the student's responsibility to undertake assignments independently, parents/guardians may serve as a resource and are encouraged to ensure that their child's homework assignments are completed. Students may also work with other students and use approved outside resources as directed by the teacher.

To further support students' homework efforts, the Superintendent or designee may establish and maintain electronic forums, provide access to school library media centers and technological resources, and/or provide before-school and after-school programs where students can receive homework assistance from teachers, volunteers, and/or student tutors. The Board encourages the Superintendent or designee to design class and transportation schedules that will enable students to make use of homework support services.

Teachers shall review all completed homework to assess the student's understanding of academic content and shall provide timely feedback to the student.

If a student repeatedly fails to complete homework, the teacher shall notify the student's parents/guardians as soon as possible so that corrective action can be taken prior to the release of any final grades or report cards.

Makeup Work

Students who are absent from school shall be given the opportunity to complete all assignments and tests that can be reasonably provided. As determined by the teacher, the assignments and tests shall be equivalent to, but not necessarily identical to, the assignments and tests missed during the absence. Students shall receive full credit for work satisfactorily completed within a reasonable period of time.

The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians that no student may have a grade reduced or lose academic credit for any excused absence when missed assignments and tests are satisfactorily completed within a reasonable period of time. Such notification shall include the full text of Education Code 48205.  (Education Code 48980)

Suspended Students

When a parent/guardian of a student who has been suspended for two or more school days requests homework that the student would otherwise have been assigned, the student's teacher shall provide such homework. If a homework assignment is requested and is turned in to the teacher by the student either upon the student's return from suspension or within the timeframe originally prescribed by the teacher, whichever is later, and is not graded before the end of the academic term, the homework assignment shall not be included in the calculation of the student's overall grade in the class.  (Education Code 48913.5)

The teacher of any class from which a student is suspended may require the student to complete any assignments and tests missed during the suspension.  (Education Code 48913)
