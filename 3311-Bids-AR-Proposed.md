The Superintendent or designee shall call for bids by placing a notice at least once a week for two weeks in a local newspaper of general circulation published in the District, or if no such newspaper exists, then in some newspaper of general circulation that is circulated in the county. Additionally, the Superintendent or designee may post the notice on the District's website or through an electronic portal.

	After being opened, all submitted bids become public records pursuant to Government Code 7920.530 and shall be made available for public review pursuant to law, Board policy, and administrative regulation

Prequalification Procedure

When required by law or the Board, the Superintendent or designee shall establish a uniform system for rating bidders on the basis of completed questionnaires and financial statements in order to determine the size of contracts on which each bidder is qualified to bid. For this purpose, the Superintendent or designee shall furnish prospective bidders a standardized prequalification questionnaire and financial record which, when completed, shall indicate a bidder's statement of financial ability and experience in performing public works. The bidder's information shall be verified under oath in the manner in which civil law pleadings are verified. The questionnaires and financial statements shall not be public records and shall not be open to public inspection.  (Code of Civil Procedure 446; Public Contract Code 20111.5, 20111.6)

When any public project involves an expenditure of $1,000,000 or more and is funded or reimbursed wholly or partly by state general funds, the School Facilities Program funds, or other future state school bond, the District shall prequalify prospective bidders either quarterly or annually. The prequalification shall be valid for one year and the following requirements shall apply:  (Public Contract Code 20111.6)

	Prospective bidders, including, but not limited to, prime, general engineering, and general building contractors and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors, as defined in Public Contract Code 4113 or Business and Professions Code 7056 or 7057, as applicable, shall submit a standardized questionnaire and financial statement 10 or more business days, as determined by the District, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids
	 
	Prospective bidders shall be prequalified by the District five or more business days, as determined by the District, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids

If the project includes electrical, mechanical, or plumbing components that will be performed by electrical, mechanical, or plumbing contractors, the Superintendent or designee shall make available to all bidders a list of prequalified general contractors and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors five or more business days, as determined by the District, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids.  (Public Contract Code 20111.6)

For all other contracts requiring competitive bidding, the District may establish a procedure for prequalifying bidders on a quarterly basis and may authorize that prequalification be considered valid for up to one calendar year following the date of the initial prequalification. Prospective bidders for such contracts shall submit the questionnaire and financial statement at least five days before the date fixed for public opening of sealed bids and shall be prequalified by the District at least one day before the fixed bid-opening date.  (Public Contract Code 20111.5)

Limitation on Use of Sole Sourcing

In any contract for the construction, alteration, or repair of school facilities, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the bid specification:  (Public Contract Code 3400)

	Does not directly or indirectly limit bidding to any one specific concern
	 
	Does not call for a designated material, product, thing, or service by a specific brand or trade name, unless the specification is followed by the words "or equal," so that bidders may furnish any equal material, product, thing, or service
	
	In any such case, the bid specification shall provide a time period, before and/or after the award of the contract, for the contractor to submit data substantiating the request for substituting the designated material, product, thing, or service. If no such time period is specified, the contractor may submit the data within 35 days after the award of the contract.

When the bid is for a roof project, a material, product, thing, or service is considered "equal" to that designated if it is equal in quality, durability, design, and appearance; will perform the intended function equally well; and conforms substantially to the detailed requirements in the bid specification.  (Public Contract Code 3002)

However, the Superintendent or designee may designate a specific material, product, thing, or service by brand or trade name, also known as sole sourcing, if the Board has made a finding, described in the invitation for bids or request for proposals (RFP), that a particular material, product, thing, or service is designated for any of the following purposes:  (Public Contract Code 3400)

	To conduct a field test or experiment to determine its suitability for future use
	 
	To match others in use on a particular public improvement that has been completed or is in the course of completion
	 
	To obtain a necessary item that is only available from one source
	 
	To respond to the Board's declaration of an emergency, so long as the declaration has been approved by four-fifths of the Board when issuing the invitation for bid or RFP

Bids Not Required

Without taking estimates or advertising for bids, supplementary textbooks, library books, educational films, audiovisual materials, test materials, workbooks, instructional computer software packages, or periodicals may be purchased in any amount.  (Public Contract Code 20118.3)

Perishable foodstuffs and seasonal commodities needed in the operations of cafeterias may be purchased through bid or on the open market.  (Education Code 38083)

Bids shall not be required for day labor under circumstances specified in Public Contract Code 20114. Day labor shall include the use of maintenance personnel employed on a permanent or temporary basis.  (Public Contract Code 20114)

The District may purchase any surplus property from the federal government or any of its agencies in any quantity needed for the operation of its schools without taking estimates or advertising for bids.  (Education Code 17602)

</ol>
<strong>Prequalification Procedure</strong><br>
<br>
When required by law or the Board, the Superintendent or designee shall establish a uniform system for rating bidders on the basis of completed questionnaires and financial statements in order to determine the size of contracts on which each bidder is qualified to bid. For this purpose, the Superintendent or designee shall furnish prospective bidders a standardized prequalification questionnaire and financial record which, when completed, shall indicate a bidder&#39;s statement of financial ability and experience in performing public works. The bidder&#39;s information shall be verified under oath in the manner in which civil law pleadings are verified. The questionnaires and financial statements shall not be public records and shall not be open to public inspection.&nbsp; (Code of Civil Procedure 446; Public Contract Code 20111.5, 20111.6)<br>
<br>
When any public project involves an expenditure of $1,000,000 or more and is funded or reimbursed wholly or partly by state general funds, the School Facilities Program funds, or other future state school bond, the District shall prequalify prospective bidders either quarterly or annually. The prequalification shall be valid for one year and the following requirements shall apply:&nbsp; (Public Contract Code 20111.6)
<ol>
	<li>Prospective bidders, including, but not limited to, prime, general engineering, and general building contractors and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors, as defined in Public Contract Code 4113 or Business and Professions Code 7056 or 7057, as applicable, shall submit a standardized questionnaire and financial statement 10 or more business days, as determined by the District, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Prospective bidders shall be prequalified by the District five or more business days, as determined by the District, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids</li>
</ol>
If the project includes electrical, mechanical, or plumbing components that will be performed by electrical, mechanical, or plumbing contractors, the Superintendent or designee shall make available to all bidders a list of prequalified general contractors and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors five or more business days, as determined by the District, before the date fixed for the public opening of sealed bids.&nbsp; (Public Contract Code 20111.6)<br>
<br>
For all other contracts requiring competitive bidding, the District may establish a procedure for prequalifying bidders on a quarterly basis and may authorize that prequalification be considered valid for up to one calendar year following the date of the initial prequalification. Prospective bidders for such contracts shall submit the questionnaire and financial statement at least five days before the date fixed for public opening of sealed bids and shall be prequalified by the District at least one day before the fixed bid-opening date.&nbsp; (Public Contract Code 20111.5)<br>
<br>
<strong>Limitation on Use of Sole Sourcing</strong><br>
<br>
In any contract for the construction, alteration, or repair of school facilities, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the bid specification:&nbsp; (Public Contract Code 3400)
<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal">
	<li>Does not directly or indirectly limit bidding to any one specific concern<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Does not call for a designated material, product, thing, or service by a specific brand or trade name, unless the specification is followed by the words &quot;or equal,&quot; so that bidders may furnish any equal material, product, thing, or service<br>
	<br>
	In any such case, the bid specification shall provide a time period, before and/or after the award of the contract, for the contractor to submit data substantiating the request for substituting the designated material, product, thing, or service. If no such time period is specified, the contractor may submit the data within 35 days after the award of the contract.</li>
</ol>
When the bid is for a roof project, a material, product, thing, or service is considered &quot;equal&quot; to that designated if it is equal in quality, durability, design, and appearance; will perform the intended function equally well; and conforms substantially to the detailed requirements in the bid specification.&nbsp; (Public Contract Code 3002)<br>
<br>
However, the Superintendent or designee may designate a specific material, product, thing, or service by brand or trade name, also known as sole sourcing, if the Board has made a finding, described in the invitation for bids or request for proposals (RFP), that a particular material, product, thing, or service is designated for any of the following purposes:&nbsp; (Public Contract Code 3400)
<ol>
	<li>To conduct a field test or experiment to determine its suitability for future use<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>To match others in use on a particular public improvement that has been completed or is in the course of completion<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>To obtain a necessary item that is only available from one source<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>To respond to the Board&#39;s declaration of an emergency, so long as the declaration has been approved by four-fifths of the Board when issuing the invitation for bid or RFP</li>
</ol>
<strong>Bids Not Required</strong><br>
<br>
Without taking estimates or advertising for bids, supplementary textbooks, library books, educational films, audiovisual materials, test materials, workbooks, instructional computer software packages, or periodicals may be purchased in any amount.&nbsp; (Public Contract Code 20118.3)<br>
<br>
Perishable foodstuffs and seasonal commodities needed in the operations of cafeterias may be purchased through bid or on the open market.&nbsp; (Education Code 38083)<br>
<br>
