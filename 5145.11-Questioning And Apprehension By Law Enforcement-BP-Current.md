## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is optional and should be modified to reflect district practice. The policy applies only to questioning of students by law enforcement and does not apply to questioning by school resource officers or district personnel in connection with school discipline issues. In addition, this policy does not apply to the interviewing of suspected child abuse victims by a child protective agency representative not accompanied by law enforcement; see AR 5141.4 - Child Abuse Prevention and Reporting. For searches of students and/or their belongings, see BP/AR 5145.12 - Search and Seizure.California Attorney General opinions have long recognized law enforcement's authority to question students (a "seizure") at school without parental consent and required school officials to avoid interfering with law enforcement investigations. However, the courts have yet to provide clear guidance on this issue. In 2009, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled in Greene v. Camreta that, absent exigent circumstances, a social worker and sheriff could not question a student in school without obtaining a warrant, court order, or parent/guardian consent. That ruling was vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court on appeal. Because of this lack of clear guidance, districts should proceed with caution and consult with legal counsel as necessary.
The Governing Board believes that the safety of district students and staff is essential to achieving the goal of student learning.  In accordance with standards specified in law, law enforcement officers may interview and question students on school premises and may remove them when appropriate.

The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with local law enforcement agencies to establish procedures which enable law enforcement officers to carry out their duties on school campus, including, when necessary, the questioning and/or apprehension of students.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Though required to cooperate with law enforcement officers when they come on campus to interview students, to avoid liability school officials must exercise caution to ascertain the identity of any such law enforcement officer, his/her official capacity, and the authority under which he/she acts.
When any law enforcement officer requests an interview with a student, the principal or designee shall request the officer's identity, his/her official capacity, and the legal authority under which the interview is to be conducted.  The principal or designee shall maintain a record of all documentation relative to law enforcement interviews of students.

The principal or designee shall accommodate the interview in a way that causes the least possible disruption for the student and school and provides the student appropriate privacy.

At the law enforcement officer's discretion and with the student's approval, the principal or designee may be present during the interview.

Except in cases of child abuse or neglect, the principal or designee shall attempt to notify the student's parent/guardian as soon as practicable after the law enforcement officer has interviewed the student on school premises.

If a minor student is removed from school into the custody of law enforcement, the principal or designee shall immediately notify the parent/guardian or responsible relative regarding the student's release and the place to which he/she is reportedly being taken, except when the minor has been taken into custody as a victim of suspected child abuse.  (Education Code 48906)

Subpoenas

CSBA NOTE: Penal Code 1328 requires that the serving of a subpoena on a minor in a criminal action must be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the minor's parent/guardian, conservator, or similar fiduciary. If one of those individuals cannot be located with reasonable diligence, the subpoena may be served on a minor age 12 or older.
Although subpoenas may legally be served at school on students age 12 or older, the Board believes that serving officials should be strongly urged to serve subpoenas at the home of the student whenever possible.  When served at school, the principal or designee shall take reasonable steps to protect the student's privacy rights and to minimize loss of class time for the student.
