The Board prohibits the possession, use, or sale of drugs and alcohol at any time in District-owned or leased buildings, on District property, and in District vehicles, unless otherwise permitted by law.

The following substances are prohibited on all District property:


	Any substance which may not lawfully be possessed, used, or sold in California
	 
	Cannabis or cannabis products  (Health and Safety Code 11362.3; 21 USC 812, 844)
	 
	Alcoholic beverages, unless approved by the Superintendent or designee for limited purposes specified in Business and Professions Code 25608

Prescription medication, except for prescribed cannabis, may be administered at school in accordance with law, District policy and regulations, and written statements by the parent/guardian and the student's authorized health care provider as applicable.

Information about the District's drug- and alcohol-free schools policy and the consequences for violations shall be communicated clearly to employees, parents/guardians, students, and the community.

Enforcement/Discipline

The Superintendent or designee shall take appropriate action to eliminate the possession, use, or sale of alcohol and other drugs and related paraphernalia in District facilities, on District property, in District vehicles, or at school-sponsored activities. As appropriate, he/she may direct anyone violating this policy to leave school property and/or refer the matter to law enforcement.

Students and employees who violate the terms of this policy may be subject to discipline and/or referred to assistance programs in accordance with law and Board policy.
