## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy covers waiver requests that the State Board of Education (SBE) generally has legal authority to grant (general waivers). In order to provide districts with flexibility without undermining the basic intent of the law, Education Code 33050-33053 permit the Governing Board to request that SBE waive sections of the Education Code and Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations.Education Code 33050 exempts certain sections of the Education Code from SBE's authority to grant waivers. Education Code 33050 prohibits the waiver of specified provisions relating to funding for charter schools, and, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), prohibits the waiver of transitional kindergarten and kindergarten requirements provided for in Education Code 48000-48003.This policy does not address waivers expressly authorized by law for specific programs and situations (specific waivers) such as the waiver of Education Code 56101 for students with disabilities, the waiver of specified school site council provisions pursuant to Education Code 65001, waivers that may be granted by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, or waivers that may be specifically granted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction such as waivers for alternative schools. See BP 6181 - Alternative Schools/Programs of Choice. For any such waiver, the process for obtaining the waiver would be as specified in the provision of law governing the program.
The Governing Board recognizes that circumstances may arise in the operation of the district that require a waiver from state law or regulation. When it is in the interest of district students, the Board may request that the State Board of Education (SBE) waive any provision of state law or regulation which SBE has authority to waive pursuant to Education Code 33050.

CSBA NOTE: The California Department of Education (CDE) website contains an online waiver request system as well as guidance and Frequently Asked Questions to help expedite the waiver submission process. Prior to submitting a waiver request, the district should confirm that it has gathered all the data required and has complied with all the legal requirements for the request. The district should also review Education Code 33051 which specifies the reasons for which SBE may deny the request.
Any waiver request to be submitted to SBE shall first be approved by the Board. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each proposed waiver request includes all information necessary for the Board to analyze the need for the waiver and make an informed decision.

If the proposed waiver request affects a program that requires the existence of a school site council, the Superintendent or designee shall obtain the school site council's approval of the request before presenting it to the Board. As appropriate, other councils or advisory committees, including bilingual advisory committees, shall be provided adequate opportunity to review a proposed waiver request, and the request shall include a written summary of any objections to the request by the councils or advisory committees.  (Education Code 33051)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts with an employee organization certified to represent the district's employees in negotiations with the district.
In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the exclusive representative of district employees in the development of the waiver request, and shall include in the request the exclusive representative's position regarding the waiver.  (Education Code 33050, 33051)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that participate in a joint powers entity to operate a regional occupational center or program. See BP 6178.2 - Regional Occupational Center/Program.
A request for a waiver related to a regional occupational center or program operated by a joint powers agency shall be submitted as a joint waiver request with other participating school districts upon approval of a unanimous vote of the governing board of the joint powers agency.  (Education Code 33050)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 33050 does not include specific requirements in regard to the public hearing that must be held before the Board submits a waiver request. CDE's, "General Waiver Requests", located on its website, state that the public hearing must be properly noticed and held during a board meeting.
To receive public testimony on each proposal for a waiver request, the Board shall hold a properly noticed public hearing during a Board meeting.  (Education Code 33050)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 33050 does not specify the length of the advanced notice required for the public hearing described above. However, CSBA believes that the notice must allow sufficient time to enable members of the public adequate opportunity to participate in the waiver request process.CDE's, "General Waiver Requests," provide that distribution of the board meeting agenda is insufficient to constitute proper notice for the public hearing. The notice must specifically invite public testimony, and can be advertised by (1) printing a notice that includes the time, date, location, and subject of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation, (2) in small districts, posting a formal notice at each school and three public places in the district, or (3) publishing a notice on the district's website that includes the time, date, location, and subject of the hearing. Districts should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or legal counsel prior to advertising the public hearing by another means.The following optional paragraph may be revised to specify the length of the notice in accordance with district practice, and should be modified appropriately depending on the size of the district.
The notice, which shall state the time, date, location, and subject of the public hearing and invite public testimony, shall be printed in a newspaper of general circulation, posted at each school and three public places in the district, or published on the district's website.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 33051, any general waiver which has been granted for two consecutive years, or which is initially granted for two years, may be regarded as "permanent" for as long as the information on the waiver request remains current. However, SBE may require updated information for a general waiver whenever it determines that information to be necessary. SBE may also rescind a waiver if additional information supporting a recession is made available to SBE.
If the district determines that a waiver is needed for more than one year, the Board shall reapply to SBE. When the Board has requested and received the same general waiver from SBE for two consecutive years, the Board does not subsequently need to reapply annually provided that the information contained on the request remains current, except that the district shall apply annually for the renewal of any waiver regarding teacher credentialing.  (Education Code 33051)

If the district determines that a waiver is needed for more than one year, the Board shall reapply to SBE. When the Board has requested and received the same general waiver from SBE for two consecutive years, the Board does not subsequently need to reapply annually provided that the information contained on the request remains current, except that the district shall apply annually for the renewal of any waiver regarding teacher credentialing. &nbsp;(Education Code 33051)</body>
