## Policy Content

Agenda Content

Governing Board meeting agendas shall reflect the district's vision and goals and the Board's focus on student learning and well-being.

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54954.2 requires Governing Board meeting agendas to briefly describe each item to be discussed, including closed session items, and states that a brief general description of an item generally need not exceed 20 words. For information regarding the different types of meetings and meeting location requirements, including teleconferenced meetings, see BB 9320 - Meetings and Notices. For agenda requirements regarding closed session agenda items, see BB 9321 - Closed Session.
Each agenda shall state the meeting time and location and shall briefly describe each item to be transacted or discussed, including items to be discussed in closed session.  (Government Code 54954.2)

The agenda shall provide members of the public the opportunity to address the Board on any agenda item before or during the Board's consideration of the item. The agenda for a regular meeting shall also provide members of the public an opportunity to address the Board regarding matters within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board which are not on the agenda.  (Education Code 35145.5; Government Code 54954.3)

The agenda does not need to provide an opportunity for public comment on an item that has previously been considered at an open meeting by a committee comprised exclusively of Board members, provided that members of the public were afforded an opportunity to comment on the item, before or during the committee's consideration of the item, and the item has not been substantially changed since the committee considered it.  (Government Code 54954.3)

The notice and agenda shall describe the means available for the public to access the meeting and provide public comment in-person and, if a Board member is appearing remotely due to an emergency circumstance or for just cause pursuant to Government Code 54953, through an internet-based service or call-in option.  (Government Code 54953)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54954.2 requires that the agenda include information regarding how, when, and to whom a request for a disability-related accommodation or modification may be made. Additionally, Government Code 54953, as amended by AB 2449 (Ch. 285, Statutes of 2022), requires boards to maintain and implement a procedure for receiving and swiftly resolving requests for reasonable accommodation for individuals with disabilities, consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and to resolve any doubt in favor of accessibility. See BB 9320 - Meetings and Notices. The following paragraph should be modified to reflect district practice as to when and to whom such a request should be made.
The agenda shall include information regarding how, when, and to whom a request for disability-related accommodations or modifications, including auxiliary aids and services, may be made by an individual who requires accommodations or modifications in order to participate in the Board meeting, as well as the procedure for receiving and resolving such requests as required by law.  (Government Code 54954.2, 54953)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54957.5, the agenda for a regular meeting must include the address of the location where the public can inspect any materials that are related to an open session item and are distributed to the Board less than 72 hours before that meeting. In Fowler v. City of Lafayette, the court clarified that the disclosure requirements of Government Code 54957.5 also apply to claims or written threats of litigation pursuant to Government Code 54956.9.See the section below entitled "Agenda Dissemination to Members of the Public."
Each agenda for a regular meeting shall list the address designated by the Superintendent or designee for public inspection of documents related to an open session item, or for records of a statement threatening litigation against the district to be discussed in closed session, when such documents have been distributed to the Board less than 72 hours before the meeting.  (Government Code 54956.9, 54957.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Pursuant to Education Code 49073.2, the Board is prohibited from including in its minutes a student's directory information, as defined in Education Code 49061, or a parent/guardian's personal information, as defined in Education Code 49073.2, when the student or parent/guardian has provided the Board with a written request that such information be excluded; see BB 9324 - Minutes and Recordings. In order to notify students and parents/guardians of the right to request that such information be withheld, the Board should consider including a statement in each agenda.
Each agenda shall include a statement regarding the option for students and parents/guardians to request that directory information or personal information of the student or parent/guardian, as defined in Education Code 49061 and/or 49073.2, be excluded from the minutes. The agenda shall also state that the request must be made in writing to the secretary or clerk of the Board.

Agenda Preparation

The Board president and the Superintendent, as secretary to the Board, shall work together to develop the agenda for each regular and special meeting.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35145.5 mandates that the Board adopt reasonable regulations to ensure that members of the public can place matters directly related to district business on Board meeting agendas. The following paragraph, including the timeline, should be revised to reflect district practice. Districts are free to establish their own timeline for placing an item on the agenda, taking into account staff time and resources, as long as the established timeline is a reasonable one. In Caldwell v. Roseville Joint Union High School District, a federal district court upheld a district bylaw requiring members of the public to submit a written request in order to place items on a meeting agenda. The case involved an alleged violation of the plaintiff's First Amendment rights when the district did not place an item on the agenda in response to the plaintiff's oral request because the district disagreed with the plaintiff's religious beliefs. However, the court held that the district's bylaw requiring that requests first be made in writing was content-neutral and thus a reasonable restriction.
Any Board member or member of the public may request that a matter within the jurisdiction of the Board be placed on the agenda of a regular meeting. The request shall be submitted in writing to the Superintendent or designee with supporting documents and information.

CSBA NOTE: In Mooney v. Garcia, a California appeals court reaffirmed the Board's discretion in determining whether an agenda item is within the subject matter jurisdiction of a governing board.
The Board president and Superintendent shall decide whether a request from a member of the public is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board. Items not within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board may not be placed on the agenda. In addition, before placing the item on the agenda, the Board president and Superintendent shall determine if the item is merely a request for information, and if so, respond accordingly.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
If the Board president and Superintendent deny a request from a Board member to place an item on the agenda, the Board member may request the Board take action during a Board meeting to determine whether the item shall be placed on the agenda.

The Board president and Superintendent shall also decide whether an agenda item is appropriate for discussion in open or closed session, whether the item should be an action item subject to Board vote or an information item, and when the item is placed on the agenda.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for boards that use the consent agenda or calendar to take action on matters of a routine nature for which discussion may not be necessary. It is important for such boards to limit the use of the consent agenda to noncontroversial matters and to establish rules that help ensure that any use of the consent agenda does not reduce transparency in the Board's conduct of district business or result in violation of the open meeting laws. In addition, boards should be aware that, by law, certain items may not be placed on the consent agenda. For example, pursuant to Government Code 54960.2, a board's decision to approve or rescind its unconditional commitment to refrain from taking certain actions in violation of the Brown Act must be made as a separate item and not on the consent agenda. See BB 9323.2 - Actions by the Board.
In order to promote efficient meetings, the Board may bundle a number of items and act upon them together by a single vote through the use of a consent agenda. Consent items shall be items of a routine nature and items for which Board discussion is not anticipated and for which the Superintendent recommends approval. When any Board member requests the removal of an item from the consent agenda, the item shall be removed and given individual consideration for action as a separate agenda item.

The agenda shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to comment on any consent agenda item unless such item has been previously considered at an open meeting of a committee comprised exclusively of Board members.  (Government Code 54954.3)

Any Board action that involves borrowing $100,000 or more shall be discussed, considered, and deliberated upon as a separate item of business on the meeting agenda.  (Government Code 53635.7)

All public communications with the Board are subject to requirements of relevant Board policies and administrative regulations.

Agenda Dissemination to Board Members

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional and should be modified to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Government Code 7921.310, when the Board, in the conduct of its duties, is authorized by law to access any writing of the Board or district, including agenda and supporting documents, the district is prohibited from discriminating between or among Board members as to when and which writing will be made available.CSBA's GAMUT Meetings, an electronic board meeting agenda service for use by districts, county offices of education, and the public allows development of and access to Board meeting agendas, supporting documents, and minutes from any computer that has Internet access. Further information can be found on CSBA's website.
At least 72 hours before each regular meeting, each Board member shall be provided a copy of the agenda and agenda packet, including the Superintendent or designee's report; minutes to be approved; copies of communications; reports from committees, staff, and others; and other available supporting documents pertinent to the meeting.

When special meetings are called, Board members shall receive, at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, notice of the business to be transacted.  (Government Code 54956)

Board members shall review agenda materials before each meeting. Individual members may confer directly with the Superintendent or designee to ask questions and/or request additional information on agenda items. However, a majority of Board members shall not, outside of a noticed meeting, directly or through intermediaries or electronic means discuss, deliberate, or take action on any matter within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board.

Agenda Dissemination to Members of the Public

Agenda and related materials distributed to the Board shall be made available to the public upon request without delay. However, only those documents which are disclosable public records under the Public Records Act (PRA) and which relate to an agenda item scheduled for the open session portion of a regular meeting or which contain a claim or written threat of litigation which will be discussed in closed session shall be made available to the public.  (Government Code 54956.9, 54957.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54954.2, the agenda for a regular meeting of the Board must be posted at least 72 hours prior to the meeting on the district's website, if it has one, and at a location that is freely accessible to the public. The Attorney General has determined in 78 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 327 (1995) that weekend hours may be counted as part of the 72-hour period for posting of the agenda prior to a regular meeting. In the same opinion, the Attorney General found that the term "freely accessible" requires that the agenda be posted in a location where it can be read by the public at any time, including evening hours, during the 72 hours immediately preceding the meeting. Also see BB 9320 - Meetings and Notices.
At least 72 hours prior to a regular meeting, the agenda shall be posted at one or more locations freely accessible to members of the public.  (Government Code 54954.2)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54954.2 requires that the agenda be posted on the homepage of the district website, if it has one, in accordance with law. Districts that use an integrated agenda management platform, such as CSBA's GAMUT Meetings, may provide a direct link on the homepage of the district's website to access agendas posted on the platform. Pursuant to Government Code 54954.2, the link must not be solely accessible through a contextual menu, and the agenda must be posted in a format which is retrievable, downloadable, indexable, electronically searchable by commonly used Internet search applications, available to the public free of charge, and without any restriction that would impede the reuse or redistribution of the agenda.The Attorney General has opined in 99 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 11 (2016) that the Brown Act regular meeting online agenda posting provision contained within Government Code 54954.2 is not necessarily violated when a local agency's website experiences technical difficulties that cause the agenda to become inaccessible to the public for a portion of the 72 hours that precede the scheduled meeting. If the local agency has otherwise substantially complied with the Brown Act agenda posting requirements, the legislative body may lawfully hold its regular meeting as scheduled.Pursuant to Government Code 54957.5, as amended by AB 2647 (Ch. 971, Statutes of 2022), the district may post on the district's website any writing related to an open session item of a regular Board meeting which is distributed to Board members less than 72 hours before the meeting, when, due to the closure of the location designated for inspection, the writing is not available for inspection by the public. To post such a writing, the requirements specified in Items #1-4 below must be met. Districts with questions regarding this exception are encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall post the agenda on the homepage of the district website. The posted agenda shall be accessible through a prominent direct link to the current agenda or to the district's agenda management platform in accordance with Government Code 54954.2. When the district utilizes an integrated agenda management platform, the link to that platform shall take the user directly to the website with the district's agendas, and the current agenda shall be the first available.  (Government Code 54954.2)

If a writing which relates to an open session agenda item or which contains a claim or written threat of litigation which will be discussed in closed session during a regular Board meeting is distributed to the Board less than 72 hours prior to a meeting, the Superintendent or designee shall make the writing available for public inspection at a designated location at the same time the document is distributed to all or a majority of the Board. However, if the writing is distributed to at least a majority of the Board at a time when the designated location is closed to the public, this requirement may be satisfied by posting the writing on the district website if the following conditions are met:  (Government Code 54957.5)

	An initial staff report or similar document containing an executive summary and any staff recommendations related to the agenda item is made available for public inspection at the designated location at least 72 hours before the meeting
	 
	The writing is immediately posted on the district's website in a position and manner that makes it clear that the writing relates to an agenda item for the upcoming meeting
	 
	The district lists the website address where such writings may be accessed on all Board meeting agendas
	 
	A physical copy of the document is made available for public inspection at the designated location at the beginning of the next regular business hours, but not less than 24 hours before the relevant Board meeting

The Superintendent or designee shall mail a copy of the agenda or a copy of all the documents constituting the agenda packet to any person who requests the items. The materials shall be mailed at the time the agenda is posted or upon distribution of the agenda to a majority of the Board, whichever occurs first.  (Government Code 54954.1)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for districts that have a website and should be deleted by districts that do not have a website. Pursuant to Government Code 54954.1, any district with a website is required to email a copy of, or a website link to, the agenda or a copy of all the documents constituting the agenda packet if a person requests that such items be delivered by email, as specified below.
The Superintendent or designee shall email a copy of, or a website link to, the agenda or a copy of all the documents constituting the agenda packet to any person who requests such items to be delivered by email. If the Superintendent or designee determines that it is technologically infeasible to do so, a copy of the agenda or a website link to the agenda and a copy of all other documents constituting the agenda packet shall be sent to the person who has made the request in accordance with mailing requirements specified in law.  (Government Code 54954.1)

Any request for mailed copies of agendas or agenda packets shall be in writing and shall be valid for the calendar year in which it is filed. Written requests must be renewed following January 1 of each year.  (Government Code 54954.1)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that charge a fee for mailing the agenda or agenda packet. Government Code 54954.1 authorizes districts to charge a fee for mailing the agenda or agenda packet as long as the fee does not exceed the cost of providing the service. Pursuant to Government Code 54957.5, a surcharge may not be imposed for providing the agenda and other public record documents in alternative formats to persons with disabilities.
Persons requesting mailing of the agenda or agenda packet shall pay an annual fee, as determined by the Superintendent or designee, not to exceed the cost of providing the service.

Any document prepared by the district or Board and distributed during a public meeting shall be made available for public inspection at the meeting. Any document prepared by another person shall be made available for public inspection after the meeting. These requirements shall not apply to a document that is exempt from public disclosure under the PRA.  (Government Code 54957.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54954.1, upon request, the agenda and supporting documentation must be made available in appropriate alternative formats to persons with a disability, as required under the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 USC 12132). Examples of alternative formats, also referred to as "auxiliary aids and services," are listed in 28 CFR 36.303 and include accessible electronic and information technology, audio recordings, or Braille materials.
Upon request, the Superintendent or designee shall make the agenda, agenda packet, and/or any writings distributed at the meeting available in appropriate alternative formats to persons with a disability, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act.  (Government Code 54954.1)

<div id='ENg921' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35145.5 mandates that the Board adopt reasonable regulations to ensure that members of the public can place matters directly related to district business on Board meeting agendas. The following paragraph, including the timeline, should be revised to reflect district practice. Districts are free to establish their own timeline for placing an item on the agenda, taking into account staff time and resources, as long as the established timeline is a reasonable one. In Caldwell v. Roseville Joint Union High School District, a federal district court upheld a district bylaw requiring members of the public to submit a written request in order to place items on a meeting agenda. The case involved an alleged violation of the plaintiff's First Amendment rights when the district did not place an item on the agenda in response to the plaintiff's oral request because the district disagreed with the plaintiff's religious beliefs. However, the court held that the district's bylaw requiring that requests first be made in writing was content-neutral and thus a reasonable restriction.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="xMTUOQ4" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22xMTUOQ4%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22ENg921%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1686791160%2C%22text%22%3A%22Education%20Code%2035145.5%20mandates%20that%20the%20Board%20adopt%20reasonable%20regulations%20to%20ensure%20that%20members%20of%20the%20public%20can%20place%20matters%20directly%20related%20to%20district%20business%20on%20Board%20meeting%20agendas.%20The%20following%20paragraph%2C%20including%20the%20timeline%2C%20should%20be%20revised%20to%20reflect%20district%20practice.%20Districts%20are%20free%20to%20establish%20their%20own%20timeline%20for%20placing%20an%20item%20on%20the%20agenda%2C%20taking%20into%20account%20staff%20time%20and%20resources%2C%20as%20long%20as%20the%20established%20timeline%20is%20a%20reasonable%20one.%20In%20Caldwell%20v.%20Roseville%20Joint%20Union%20High%20School%20District%2C%20a%20federal%20district%20court%20upheld%20a%20district%20bylaw%20requiring%20members%20of%20the%20public%20to%20submit%20a%20written%20request%20in%20order%20to%20place%20items%20on%20a%20meeting%20agenda.%20The%20case%20involved%20an%20alleged%20violation%20of%20the%20plaintiff%27s%20First%20Amendment%20rights%20when%20the%20district%20did%20not%20place%20an%20item%20on%20the%20agenda%20in%20response%20to%20the%20plaintiff%27s%20oral%20request%20because%20the%20district%20disagreed%20with%20the%20plaintiff%27s%20religious%20beliefs.%20However%2C%20the%20court%20held%20that%20the%20district%27s%20bylaw%20requiring%20that%20requests%20first%20be%20made%20in%20writing%20was%20content-neutral%20and%20thus%20a%20reasonable%20restriction.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-xMTUOQ4" title="CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35145.5 mandates that th..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

Pursuant to Government Code 54954.2, the link must not be solely accessible through a contextual menu, and the agenda must be posted in a format which is retrievable, downloadable, indexable, electronically searchable by commonly used Internet search applications, available to the public free of charge, and without any restriction that would impede the reuse or redistribution of the agenda.<br><br>The Attorney General has opined in 99 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 11 (2016) that the Brown Act regular meeting online agenda posting provision contained within Government Code 54954.2 is not necessarily violated when a local agency's website experiences technical difficulties that cause the agenda to become inaccessible to the public for a portion of the 72 hours that precede the scheduled meeting. If the local agency has otherwise substantially complied with the Brown Act agenda posting requirements, the legislative body may lawfully hold its regular meeting as scheduled.<br><br>Pursuant to Government Code 54957.5, as amended by AB 2647 (Ch. 971, Statutes of 2022), the district may post on the district's website any writing related to an open session item of a regular Board meeting which is distributed to Board members less than 72 hours before the meeting, when, due to the closure of the location designated for inspection, the writing is not available for inspection by the public. To post such a writing, the requirements specified in Items #1-4 below must be met. Districts with questions regarding this exception are encouraged to consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="xMTUOQ10" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22xMTUOQ10%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22MOQ927%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1687282539%2C%22text%22%3A%22Government%20Code%2054954.2%20requires%20that%20the%20agenda%20be%20posted%20on%20the%20homepage%20of%20the%20district%20website%2C%20if%20it%20has%20one%2C%20in%20accordance%20with%20law.%20Districts%20that%20use%20an%20integrated%20agenda%20management%20platform%2C%20such%20as%20CSBA%27s%20GAMUT%20Meetings%2C%20may%20provide%20a%20direct%20link%20on%20the%20homepage%20of%20the%20district%27s%20website%20to%20access%20agendas%20posted%20on%20the%20platform.%20Pursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2054954.2%2C%20the%20link%20must%20not%20be%20solely%20accessible%20through%20a%20contextual%20menu%2C%20and%20the%20agenda%20must%20be%20posted%20in%20a%20format%20which%20is%20retrievable%2C%20downloadable%2C%20indexable%2C%20electronically%20searchable%20by%20commonly%20used%20Internet%20search%20applications%2C%20available%20to%20the%20public%20free%20of%20charge%2C%20and%20without%20any%20restriction%20that%20would%20impede%20the%20reuse%20or%20redistribution%20of%20the%20agenda.%5Cn%5CnThe%20Attorney%20General%20has%20opined%20in%2099%20Ops.%20Cal.%20Atty.%20Gen.%2011%20%282016%29%20that%20the%20Brown%20Act%20regular%20meeting%20online%20agenda%20posting%20provision%20contained%20within%20Government%20Code%2054954.2%20is%20not%20necessarily%20violated%20when%20a%20local%20agency%27s%20website%20experiences%20technical%20difficulties%20that%20cause%20the%20agenda%20to%20become%20inaccessible%20to%20the%20public%20for%20a%20portion%20of%20the%2072%20hours%20that%20precede%20the%20scheduled%20meeting.%20If%20the%20local%20agency%20has%20otherwise%20substantially%20complied%20with%20the%20Brown%20Act%20agenda%20posting%20requirements%2C%20the%20legislative%20body%20may%20lawfully%20hold%20its%20regular%20meeting%20as%20scheduled.%5Cn%5CnPursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2054957.5%2C%20as%20amended%20by%20AB%202647%20%28Ch.%20971%2C%20Statutes%20of%202022%29%2C%20the%20district%20may%20post%20on%20the%20district%27s%20website%20any%20writing%20related%20to%20an%20open%20session%20item%20of%20a%20regular%20Board%20meeting%20which%20is%20distributed%20to%20Board%20members%20less%20than%2072%20hours%20before%20the%20meeting%2C%20when%2C%20due%20to%20the%20closure%20of%20the%20location%20designated%20for%20inspection%2C%20the%20writing%20is%20not%20available%20for%20inspection%20by%20the%20public.%20To%20post%20such%20a%20writing%2C%20the%20requirements%20specified%20in%20Items%20%231-4%20below%20must%20be%20met.%20Districts%20with%20questions%20regarding%20this%20exception%20are%20encouraged%20to%20consult%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-xMTUOQ10" title="CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54954.2 requires that t..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
