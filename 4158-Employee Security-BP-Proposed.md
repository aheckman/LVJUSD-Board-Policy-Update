## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide a safe and orderly work environment for all employees. As part of the District's comprehensive safety plan, the Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for protecting employees from potentially dangerous persons and situations and for providing necessary assistance and support when emergency situations occur.

Any person who threatens the safety of others at any District facility may be removed by the Superintendent or designee in accordance with Administrative Regulation 3515.2 - Disruptions.

Any employee against whom harassment, violence, or any threat of violence has been directed in the workplace shall notify the Superintendent or designee immediately. As appropriate, the Superintendent or designee shall initiate legal and security measures to protect the employee and others in the workplace. Such measures may include seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) on behalf of the employee pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 527.8 and/or a gun violence restraining order pursuant to Penal Code 18150 and 18170.

Additionally, a collective bargaining representative may seek a TRO on behalf of a District employee against whom harassment, violence, or credible threat of violence has been directed in the workplace, if the collective bargaining representative serves that employee in employment or labor matters at the employee's workplace.  (Code of Civil Procedure 527.8)

Upon request by an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the Superintendent or designee shall provide reasonable accommodations in accordance with Government Code 12945.8 and the accompanying administrative regulation to protect the employee's safety while at work.

The Superintendent or designee may pursue legal action on behalf of an employee against a student or the student's parent/guardian to recover damages for injury to the employee's person or property caused by the student's willful misconduct that occurred on District property, at a school or District activity, or in retaliation for lawful acts of the employee in the performance of the employee's duties.  (Education Code 48904, 48905)

The Superintendent or designee shall provide staff development in crisis prevention and intervention techniques, which may include training in classroom management, effective communication techniques, procedures for responding to an active shooter situation, and crisis resolution.

In accordance with law, the Superintendent or designee shall inform teachers, administrators, and/or counselors of crimes and offenses committed by students who may pose a danger in the classroom.  (Education Code 48201, 49079; Welfare and Institutions Code 827)

The Superintendent or designee may make available at appropriate locations, including, but not limited to, District and school offices, gyms, and classrooms, communication devices that would enable two-way communication with law enforcement and others when emergencies occur.

Reporting of Injurious Objects

Employees shall take immediate action upon being made aware that any person is in possession of a weapon or unauthorized injurious object on District property or at a District related or school-sponsored activity. Employees shall exercise their best judgment as to the potential danger involved and do one of the following:

	Confiscate the object and deliver it to the principal immediately
	 
	Immediately notify the principal or supervisor, who shall take appropriate action
	 
	Immediately call 911 and the principal or supervisor

When informing the principal about the possession or seizure of a weapon or dangerous device, an employee shall report the name(s) of persons involved, witnesses, location, and the circumstances of any seizure.
