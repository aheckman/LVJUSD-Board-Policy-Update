Development and Review of Comprehensive School Safety Plan

The school site council shall consult with local law enforcement, the local fire department, and other first responders in the writing and development of the comprehensive school safety plan (CSSP). When practical, the school site council shall also consult with other school site councils and safety planning committees.  (Education Code 32281, 32282)

Additionally, the school site council may invite community leaders, local emergency medical services personnel, and other persons who may be interested in the health and safety of students and the prevention of campus crime and violence to participate in the planning process.  (Education Code 32280)

The school site council may delegate the responsibility for developing a CSSP to a school safety planning committee composed of the following members:  (Education Code 32281)

	The principal or designee
	 
	One teacher who is a representative of the recognized certificated employee organization
	 
	One parent/guardian whose child attends the school
	 
	One classified employee who is a representative of the recognized classified employee organization

Before adopting the CSSP, the school site council or school safety planning committee shall hold a public meeting at the school in order to allow members of the public the opportunity to express an opinion about the plan.  (Education Code 32288)

After the first evaluation or review is conducted, and after each annual evaluation or review, a school employee, a student's parent/guardian or educational rights holder, or a student may bring concerns about an individual student's ability to access disaster safety procedures described in the CSSP to the principal.  (Education Code 32282)

If the principal determines there is merit to a concern, the principal shall direct the school site council or school safety planning committee to make appropriate modifications to the CSSP during the evaluation of the CSSP. The principal may direct the school site council or the school safety planning committee to make such modifications before the evaluation, as appropriate.  (Education Code 32282)
