## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42238.02 and 42238.03 provide supplemental and concentration grants within the local control funding formula based on the number and concentration of unduplicated counts of students who are foster youth, who are English learners, or who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals; see BP/AR 3100 - Budget. In addition, Education Code 52060-52077 require districts to develop a local control and accountability plan (LCAP) which must be aligned to specific state priorities and any additional local priorities, and which must contain annual goals for all students and for each "numerically significant" student subgroup and the specific actions to be taken to achieve each goal; see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.Education Code 48850-48859 (the AB 490 Educational Rights and Stability Act of 2003) create obligations for districts regarding the education of foster youth, including the right of foster youth to continue attending their school of origin and the requirement to ensure that foster youth have access to the same academic resources, services, and extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to all students. See the accompanying administrative regulation.While the requirements of the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 USC 11431-11435) may apply to foster youth in certain situations, such as when they are living in emergency or transitional shelters (see BP/AR 6173 - Education for Homeless Children), Education Code 48850-48859 extend services to youth at any time when in foster care. The following policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board recognizes that foster youth may face significant barriers to achieving academic success due to their family circumstances, disruption to their educational program, and their emotional, social, and other health needs that may be addressed with the provision of a safe, positive learning environment that is free from discrimination and harassment and that promotes students' self-esteem and academic achievement.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide foster youth with full access to the district's educational program and implement strategies necessary for the improvement of the academic achievement of foster youth as identified in the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP). The Superintendent or designee shall also develop strategies to build a foster youth's feeling of connectedness with school, including, but not limited to, strategies that promote positive discipline and conflict resolution, the development of resiliency and interpersonal skills, and the involvement of foster parents, group home administrators, and/or other caretakers in school programs and activities.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48850, placement determinations for foster youth are required to be made in accordance with the student's "best interest." In addition, Education Code 48853.5 requires each district to designate a staff person as a foster care liaison to help ensure proper school placement, enrollment, and transfer. See the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that placement decisions for foster youth are based on the students' best interests as defined in law and as specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.  To that end, the Superintendent or designee  shall designate a staff person as the district liaison for foster youth to help facilitate the enrollment, placement, and transfer of foster youth.

The Superintendent or designee and district liaison shall ensure that all appropriate staff, including, but not limited to, each principal, school registrar, and attendance clerk, receive training on the enrollment, placement, and transfer of foster youth and other related rights.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48853.5 encourages districts to collaborate with other agencies to provide services to foster youth. The following optional paragraph should be modified to reflect district practice.
To address the needs of foster youth and help ensure the maximum utilization of available funds, the Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with local agencies and officials including, but not limited to, the county placing agency, social services, probation officers, and juvenile court officers.  The Superintendent or designee shall explore the feasibility of entering into agreements with these groups to coordinate services and protect the rights of foster youth.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52060, each district is required to update the LCAP by July 1 each year. The following optional paragraph uses the LCAP review timeline and may be revised to reflect district practice.
At least annually and in accordance with the established timelines, the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board on the outcomes for foster youth regarding the goals and specific actions identified in the LCAP, including, but not limited to, school attendance, student achievement test results, promotion and retention rates by grade level, graduation rates, and suspension/expulsion rates. As necessary, evaluation data shall be used to determine and recommend revisions to the LCAP for improving or increasing services for foster youth.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, as amended by SB 532 (Ch. 918, Statutes of 2022), districts are required to annually report to the California Department of Education regarding the number of foster youth who, for the prior school year, graduated with an exemption from the district-established graduation requirements that are in addition to statewide coursework requirements, as specified below.
Annually, the Superintendent or designee shall report to the California Department of Education, in accordance with Education Code 51225.1, the number of foster youth graduating from the fourth or fifth year of high school who, for the prior school year, graduated with an exemption from district-established graduation requirements that are in addition to statewide coursework requirements.
