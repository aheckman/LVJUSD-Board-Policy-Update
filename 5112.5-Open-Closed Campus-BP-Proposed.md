## Policy Content

In order to give students an opportunity to demonstrate responsibility, independent judgment, and positive citizenship, the Board of Education establishes an open campus at all District high schools in which students shall have the privilege of leaving campus during lunch.

The principal or designee shall ensure that students granted this privilege meet any eligibility requirements established by the District.

The District shall send written notification to parents/guardians about the open campus policy at the beginning of the school year along with the parental notification required by Education Code 48980. Such notification shall include the language prescribed by Education Code 44808.5.

Students shall not leave school grounds at any other time during the school day without express permission of school authorities. Students who leave school without authorization shall be considered to have an unexcused absence and be subject to disciplinary action.

The principal or designee may revoke the open campus privilege for individual students for disciplinary reasons.
