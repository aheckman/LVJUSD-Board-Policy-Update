## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49501.5, as amended by SB 348 (Ch. 600, Statutes of 2023), requires districts, during each school day, to make available, free of charge, one nutritionally adequate breakfast and one nutritionally adequate lunch to any student who requests a meal,  regardless of the student's free or reduced-price meal eligibility. To be eligible for state reimbursement for provision of meals, a district must participate in the National School Lunch and/or School Breakfast Programs and comply with state and federal guidelines or regulations pursuant to Education Code 49501.5, as amended by SB 348.The following administrative regulation is for use by all districts, regardless of whether they receive reimbursement for free and reduced-price meals through the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program (42 USC 1751-1769j, 1773) and/or the State Meal Program (Education Code 49490-49494).
Applications

CSBA NOTE: The California Department of Education's (CDE), "Universal Meals Program Frequently Asked Questions," clarifies that districts participating in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program must continue to collect meal applications, as meal counts for reimbursement purposes need to be claimed in accordance with the amount of free, reduced-price, and paid meals served.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's application form for free and reduced-price meals and related materials include the statements specified in Education Code 49557 and 7 CFR 245.5. The district's application packet shall include the notifications and information listed in Education Code 49557.2.

The application form and related information shall be distributed in paper form to all parents/guardians at the beginning of each school year and shall be available to students at all times during the school day.  (Education Code 48980, 49520, 49557; 42 USC 1758; 7 CFR 245.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. In addition to the paper application form described above, Education Code 49557 authorizes districts to make the application for free or reduced-price meals available online, provided that it complies with specified requirements.
In addition, the district application form for free and reduced price meals shall be available online. The online application form shall require completion of only those questions necessary for determining eligibility, contain clear instructions for families that are experiencing homelessness or who are migratory and comply with other requirements specified in Education Code 49557.

CSBA NOTE: According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA), "Eligibility Manual for School Meals: Determining and Verifying Eligibility," households enrolling a new student after the start of the school year must also be provided an application and related materials.
An application form and related information shall also be provided whenever a new student is enrolled.

At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall send a public release, containing the same information supplied to parents/guardians and including eligibility criteria, to local media, the local unemployment office, and any major employers in the district attendance area contemplating large layoffs. Copies of the public release shall be made available upon request to any interested person.  (7 CFR 245.5)

Eligibility

CSBA NOTE: Districts are responsible for determining students' eligibility for free and reduced-price meals in accordance with criteria established by CDE consistent with 42 USC 1758 and 1773 and 7 CFR 245.3. Family income levels that qualify for free or reduced-price meals, by household size, are annually posted on CDE's website.Pursuant to 42 USC 1769c, a district that has demonstrated a high level of, or a high risk for, administrative error may be required to implement a second-level, independent review of the eligibility determination for each application. Such districts also will be subject to additional CDE reporting requirements.
The Superintendent or designee shall determine students' eligibility for the free and reduced-price meal program based on the criteria specified in 42 USC 1758 and 1773 and 7 CFR 245.1-245.13 and made available by the California Department of Education.

CSBA NOTE: In accordance with law, participants in certain state and federal programs are deemed to have met the income eligibility requirements of the free and reduced-price meal program and therefore may be directly certified as eligible without further action or additional application. For purpose of direct certification, districts may obtain data through the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS) or may enter into a local agreement with the county department of social or welfare services to match enrollment data.Pursuant to 42 USC 1758 and 7 CFR 245.6, districts must directly certify for enrollment in the free and reduced-price meal program students who participate in the CalFresh program or California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program. 42 USC 1758 and 7 CFR 245.6 also authorize, but do not require, districts to directly certify any student who is experiencing homelessness, migratory, a foster youth, or enrolled in a Head Start program. Education Code 49562, also requires districts to use participation data in the Medi-Cal program to directly certify students as eligible for free and reduced-price meals.Further information about direct certification and eligibility is available in the USDA's "Eligibility Guidance for School Meals Manual."Pursuant to 42 USC 1759a, certain districts located in high poverty areas may be eligible to participate in alternative processes for annual determinations of student eligibility for free and reduced-price meals (Provisions 1, 2, 3, and 4). Districts participating in these alternative processes should revise the following section to reflect district practice.
Participants in the CalFresh, California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKS), and Medi-Cal programs shall be directly certified for enrollment in the free and reduced-price meal program without further application. Participants in other state or federal programs may be directly certified when authorized by law.  (Education Code 49561, 49562; 42 USC 1758; 7 CFR 245.6)

Verification of Eligibility

Not later than November 15 of each year, the Superintendent or designee shall verify the eligibility of a sample of household applications approved for the school year in accordance with the sample sizes and procedures specified in 42 USC 1758 and 7 CFR 245.6a.

If the review indicates that the initial eligibility determination is correct, the Superintendent or designee shall verify the approved household application. If the review indicates that the initial eligibility determination is incorrect, the Superintendent or designee shall:  (42 USC 1758; 7 CFR 245.6a)

	If the eligibility status changes from reduced price to free, make the increased benefits immediately available and notify the household of the change in benefits
	 
	If the eligibility status changes from free to reduced price, first verify the application, then notify the household of the correct eligibility status, and, when required by law, send a notice of adverse action as described below
	 
	If the eligibility status changes from free or reduced price to paid, send the household a notice of adverse action as described below

If, as a result of verification activities, the eligibility of a household that is receiving free or reduced-price benefits cannot be confirmed, or if the household fails to cooperate with verification efforts, the Superintendent or designee shall reduce or terminate benefits, as applicable, and shall properly document and retain on file in the district the reasons for the household's ineligibility. At least 10 days prior to the actual reduction or termination, the Superintendent or designee shall send a notice of adverse action to the household. The notice shall advise the household of:  (7 CFR 245.6a)


	The change and the reasons for the change
	 
	The right to appeal, when the appeal must be filed to ensure continued benefits while awaiting a hearing and decision, and instructions on how to appeal
	 
	The right to reapply at any time during the school year

Confidentiality/Release of Records

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that have adopted a policy, pursuant to Education Code 49558, allowing designated district employees to use individual student records compiled in the administration of the free and reduced-price meal program for the purpose of disaggregation of academic achievement data and/or the provision of services under the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act pursuant to 20 USC 6301-6576. See the accompanying Board policy. Districts with questions about the use of free and reduced-price meal information for these or other purposes should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.It is recommended that the district designate by name or job title the employee(s) authorized to use records for these purposes. Districts should identify the specific title(s) of the designated employee(s) in the space provided below, such as Title I Coordinator. 
The Superintendent designates the following district employee(s) to disclose a student's name and eligibility status from individual meal records only for the purpose of disaggregation of academic achievement data and/or the provision of services under the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act pursuant to 20 USC 6301-6576.

_____________________________________
(title or position)

In permitting the disclosure of student records for such purposes, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that: (Education Code 49558)

	No individual indicators of participation in the free and reduced-price meal program are maintained in the permanent records of any student if not otherwise allowed by law
	 
	Information regarding individual student participation in the free and reduced-price meal program is not publicly released
	 
	All other confidentiality provisions required by law are met
	 
	Information collected regarding individual students certified to participate in the free and reduced-price meal program is destroyed when no longer needed for its intended purpose

Nondiscrimination Plan

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49557, even with the establishment of the California Universal Meal Program, the legal obligation under federal law to ensure that students who are eligible for free and reduced-price meals are not treated differently remains applicable to districts.
In implementing the district's food service programs for students who are eligible to receive free or reduced-price meals, the district shall ensure the following:  (Education Code 49557; 42 USC 1758)

	The names of the students shall not be published, posted, or announced in any manner, or used for any purpose other than the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, unless otherwise provided by law
	 
	There shall be no overt identification of any of the students by the use of special tokens or tickets or by any other means
	 
	The students shall not be required to work for their meals
	 
	The students shall not be required to use a separate dining area, go through a separate serving line or entrance, or consume their meals at a different time
