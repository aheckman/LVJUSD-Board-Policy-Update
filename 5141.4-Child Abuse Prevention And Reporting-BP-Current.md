## Policy Content

The Governing Board is committed to supporting the safety and well-being of district students and desires to facilitate the prevention of and response to child abuse and neglect. The Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement strategies for preventing, recognizing, and promptly reporting known or suspected child abuse and neglect.

The Superintendent or designee may provide a student who is a victim of abuse with school-based mental health services or other support services and/or may refer the student to resources available within the community as needed.

Child Abuse Prevention

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice.
The district's instructional program may provide age-appropriate and culturally sensitive child abuse prevention curriculum which explains students' right to live free of abuse, includes instruction in the skills and techniques needed to identify unsafe situations and react appropriately and promptly, informs students of available support resources, and teaches students how to obtain help and disclose incidents of abuse.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Education Code 51900.6 authorizes districts to provide age-appropriate instruction in sexual abuse and sexual assault awareness and prevention in grades K-12, provided that students are allowed to be excused from such instruction upon the written request of their parents/guardians. It also requires the State Board of Education and Superintendent of Public Instruction to consider addressing these issues in the next revision of the state health education content standards and curriculum framework.
The district's program also may include age-appropriate curriculum in sexual abuse and sexual assault awareness and prevention. Upon written request of a student's parent/guardian, the student shall be excused from taking such instruction.  (Education Code 51900.6)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 33133.5, posters notifying students of the appropriate telephone number to call to report child abuse or neglect are available on the California Department of Education's web site in five languages.  Education Code 33133.5 encourages districts to post the appropriate version or versions of the poster in an area of the school where students frequently congregate.
The Superintendent or designee may display posters, in areas on campus where students frequently congregate, notifying students of the appropriate telephone number to call to report child abuse or neglect.  (Education Code 33133.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that serve students in grades 7-12.  Education Code 215.5 requires districts that issue or reissue student identification cards to have the telephone number of the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) printed on either side of student identification cards.
In addition, student identification cards for students in grades 7-12 shall include the National Domestic Violence Hotline telephone number.  (Education Code 215.5)

The Superintendent or designee shall, to the extent feasible, seek to incorporate community resources into the district's child abuse prevention programs and may use these resources to provide parents/guardians with instruction in parenting skills and child abuse prevention.

Child Abuse Reporting

CSBA NOTE: The Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (Penal Code 11164-11174.3) identifies persons who are mandated to report known or suspected child abuse or neglect and establishes procedures for filing a report; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures for the identification and reporting of known and suspected child abuse and neglect in accordance with law.

Procedures for reporting child abuse shall be included in the district and/or school comprehensive safety plan.  (Education Code 32282)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44252 requires that teachers applying to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing for a new credential or a renewal of their credential read and sign a statement that they understand the duties imposed on them as mandated reporters pursuant to Penal Code 11164-11174.3.
District employees who are mandated reporters, as defined by law and administrative regulation, are obligated to report all known or suspected incidents of child abuse and neglect.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 44691 and Penal Code 11165.7 require districts to annually train their employees regarding the duties of mandated reporters; see the accompanying administrative regulation.  However, pursuant to Penal Code 11165.7, a lack of training does not excuse any mandated reporter from the duty to report suspected child abuse and neglect.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide training regarding the duties of mandated reporters as required by law and as specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.  (Education Code 44691; Penal Code 11165.7)
