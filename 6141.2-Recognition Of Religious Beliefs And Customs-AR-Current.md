## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation is optional and should be modified to reflect district practice. Appendix F of the California Department of Education's History and Social Science Framework, adopted in July 2016, offers guidance and support for educators regarding the recognition of religious beliefs and customs; concepts from the Appendix are reflected below.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure the following for the recognition of religious beliefs and customs in district schools:

	The approach to religion is academic and not devotional
	 
	The goal is for student awareness of religion in historical and contemporary societies
	 
	The students may not be pressed to accept any one religion
	 
	The school may include the study of religion as part of the history-social science curriculum, but the practice of religions may not be sponsored
	 
	The students may be exposed to and educated about a diversity of religious views and beliefs, but a particular view or belief may not be imposed, nor may any one religion be promoted or denigrated

Staff shall make every effort to schedule one-time events, such as examinations, school-sponsored trips, special laboratories, picture-taking days, and class parties, to minimize conflicts with major religious holidays of all faiths such that no one faith is disproportionately impacted.

Programs and Exhibits

When school programs and exhibits are in any way related to instruction about religion or religious holidays, the following guidelines shall be observed:

	The principal or designee shall ensure that school-sponsored programs are presented in an objective manner, consistent with Board policy.
	 
	The principal or designee shall be kept informed of the program's development.
	 
	Program or exhibit planners shall take into consideration the diverse religious faiths represented in the community, student body and staff.
