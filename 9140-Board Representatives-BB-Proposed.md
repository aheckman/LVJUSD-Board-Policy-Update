## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that effective performance of its community leadership responsibilities may require its participation in District or community committees on matters of concern to the District and its students.  As needed, the Board may appoint any of its members to serve as its representative on a District committee or on a committee of another public agency or organization of which the Board or District is a member or to which the Board is invited to participate.

When making such appointments, the Board shall clearly specify the authority and responsibilities of the representative(s), including, but not limited to, reporting back to the Board regarding committee activities and/or actions.  Board representatives shall not exercise the authority of the Board without prior Board approval.

If a committee discusses a topic on which the Board has taken a position, the Board member shall express the position of the Board.  When contributing his/her own ideas or opinions, the representative shall clearly indicate that he/she is expressing his/her individual idea or opinion.
