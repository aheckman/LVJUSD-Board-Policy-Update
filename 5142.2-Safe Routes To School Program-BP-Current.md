## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.Education Code 44808 provides that districts are not responsible or in any way liable for the conduct or safety of students at any time when students are not on school property unless the district has undertaken to provide transportation for students to and from the school premises, has undertaken a school-sponsored activity off premises, has otherwise specifically assumed responsibility or liability, or has failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances. Districts should consult CSBA District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel and/or the district's insurance provider regarding any potential liability issues.  Also see BP/AR 5142 - Safety.Strategies to promote walking, bicycling, and other forms of active transport to school may be included in the district's school wellness policy, adopted pursuant to 42 USC 1758b, which is required to include goals for physical activity, the district's comprehensive safety plan adopted pursuant to Education Code 32282, and the district's environmental programs. See BP 5030 - Student Wellness, AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan, and BP 3510 - Green School Operations.
The Governing Board recognizes that walking, bicycling, and other forms of active transport to school increase students' physical activity and reduce vehicle traffic and air pollution in the vicinity of schools.  As part of the district's coordinated approach to supporting student wellness and safety and enhancing student learning and achievement, the Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement strategies to establish and encourage safe routes to school program activities.

All students shall have equitable access and opportunity to participate in the district's safe routes to school program.

CSBA NOTE: Districts that have a school wellness council and/or a committee that focuses on environmental efforts may want to identify those groups to assist with the planning and coordination of safe routes to school activities, as described below. Districts may revise the following paragraph to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee may appoint a program coordinator and identify or establish district and/or school site committees to oversee and coordinate related activities.

The Superintendent or designee may collaborate with local public works and public safety departments, transportation agencies, other city and county agencies, school staff, students, parents/guardians and parent organizations, health organizations, community organizations, and/or businesses in the development, implementation, and evaluation of strategies.

Strategies in support of the safe routes to school program shall be based on the grade levels of the students and an assessment of the conditions and needs of each school and the surrounding neighborhoods.

CSBA NOTE: Both state and federal grants are available to support local efforts to increase the number of students walking and bicycling to school and to make it safer for them to do so. Pursuant to 23 USC 133, funding for infrastructure and noninfrastructure projects that support safe routes to schools may be available under the Surface Transportation Block Grant. At the state level, districts may apply for funding through the Active Transportation Program (ATP) (Streets and Highways Code 2380-2385). Funding for both federal and state programs is distributed through the California Department of Transportation's (Caltrans) Division of Local Assistance.Additionally, the district may collaborate with local agencies and organizations to find funding sources and may seek alternative funding sources for district projects and events that are not covered by a grant.Streets and Highways Code 2380 expresses legislative intent that disadvantaged communities fully share in the benefits of the ATP, and Streets and Highways Code 2382 requires that the guidelines for the ATP ensure that no less than 25 percent of overall program funds benefit disadvantaged communities, as defined, during each program cycle.
The Superintendent or designee shall explore the availability of grant funds and other sources of funding to support related projects and activities.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect indicators agreed upon by the Governing Board and Superintendent to assess progress toward program goals.  To assist with program evaluation, the National Center for Safe Routes to School (NCSRTS) has developed a standardized survey of parents/guardians' attitudes about allowing their child to walk or bicycle to school as well as student tally forms for recording the modes of travel that students use.  NCSRTS recommends that a district use these forms both before and after implementation of a project in order to evaluate changes in attitudes and behaviors. NCSRTS also provides an online data system to enter and view data collected from the parent surveys and student tallies. Caltrans requires the use of these evaluation forms by grant recipients.
The Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Board on the implementation of program activities and progress toward program goals. Such reports may include, but are not limited to, levels of participation in promotional and educational activities, survey results of parent/guardian attitudes about allowing their child to walk or bicycle to school, tallies of the numbers of students using various modes of travel to and from school and how these numbers have changed over time, records of student attendance and on-time arrival, and injury data within the school and/or district attendance boundaries.
