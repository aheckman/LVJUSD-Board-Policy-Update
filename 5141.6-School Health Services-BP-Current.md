## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy should be revised to reflect district practice. This policy addresses the provision of health services at or near school sites (e.g., a school-based or school-linked health center or mobile van) through the employment of or contract with health care professionals or community health centers, including by way of telehealth.Pursuant to Education Code 49419, the California Department of Education (CDE) has created an Office of School-Based Health Programs to assist districts with current CDE health-related programs, and to provide technical assistance, outreach, and information to districts on allowable services and submission of claims. School-based health programs provide resources, support, and information to address the physical, mental, and/or behavioral health needs of school communities, including students and staff. For more information, see CDE's website.The 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (P.L. 117-159), which amended the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (42 USC 1396a), requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (CalHHS) to publish best practices to support the delivery of services to students covered under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) via telehealth in schools, including mental health and substance use disorder services. See the section entitled "Medi-Cal Billing" in the accompanying administrative regulation.Other CSBA sample policies and/or administrative regulations address specific health requirements and services for students. For example, see BP/AR 5141.21 - Administering Medication and Monitoring Health Conditions, AR 5141.24 - Specialized Health Care Services, BP/AR 5141.3 - Health Examinations, AR 5141.32 - Health Screening for School Entry, and BP 5141.5 - Mental Health.
The Governing Board recognizes that good physical and mental health is critical to a student's ability to learn and believes that all students should have access to comprehensive health services. The Board further recognizes that schools are uniquely positioned to increase health equity and to help ensure that all students have access to necessary health care services. The district may provide access to health services at or near district schools through the establishment of a school health center and/or mobile van(s) that serve multiple campuses, and may utilize telehealth as a delivery mechanism to increase access to health care services in schools.

The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with local and state agencies and health care providers to assess the health needs of students in district schools and the community. Based on the results of this needs assessment and the availability of resources, the Superintendent or designee shall recommend for Board approval the types of health services to be provided by the district, including preventative programming and intervention strategies to address students' physical, mental, and behavioral health needs.

CSBA NOTE: School health centers are generally funded by a combination of insurance reimbursements; state, federal, and county grants; district funds; subsidies from community clinics or hospitals; and/or private donations.
Board approval shall be required for any proposed use of district resources and facilities to support school health services. The Superintendent or designee shall identify funding opportunities available through grant programs, private foundations, and partnerships with local agencies and organizations.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Board may prioritize school health services to schools serving students with the greatest need, including schools with medically underserved populations and/or a high percentage of low-income and uninsured children and youth.

School health services shall be provided under the supervision of a licensed health care professional. The Board may employ or contract with health care professionals or partner with community health centers to provide the services under the terms of a written contract or memorandum of understanding.

If a school nurse is employed by the school or district, the nurse shall be involved in planning and implementing the school health services as appropriate.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. The California Department of Education's (CDE), "Health Framework for California Public Schools," recommends a coordinated school health approach which integrates health services, health education, physical education, parent/community involvement, nutrition services, psychological and counseling services, a safe and healthy school environment, and health promotion for staff.Welfare and Institutions Code 5961-5961.5 established the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative, which was created to enhance, expand, and redesign the systems that support behavioral health for students under age 25, with the goal of delivering equitable, appropriate, timely, and accessible behavioral health services and supports. More information and resources are available on CalHHS' website.
The Superintendent or designee shall coordinate the provision of school health services with other student wellness initiatives, including health education, nutrition and physical fitness programs, and other activities designed to create a healthy school environment. The Superintendent or designee shall encourage joint planning and regular communications among health services staff, district administrators, teachers, counselors, other staff, and parents/guardians.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that choose to engage in outreach and enrollment efforts to encourage eligible students' participation in no-cost or low-cost health coverage programs.Education Code 49557.2 authorizes the district to include on the application for free and reduced-price meals information about the Medi-Cal program and a student's potential eligibility. Pursuant to Education Code 49558, districts may release information on the free and reduced-price meals application to the local agency that determines eligibility under the Medi-Cal program, provided that the student is approved for free meals and the parent/guardian consents to the sharing of information. See BP/AR 3553 - Free and Reduced Price Meals.
To further encourage student access to health care services, the Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement outreach strategies to increase enrollment of eligible students from low- to moderate-income families in affordable, comprehensive state or federal health coverage programs and local health initiatives. Such strategies may include, but are not limited to, providing information about the Medi-Cal program on the application for free and reduced-price meals in accordance with law.

Consent and Confidentiality

CSBA NOTE: Parent/guardian consent is generally required prior to providing health services to a minor student. However, Family Code 6920-6930 specify exceptions under which minors do not need parent/guardian consent prior to receiving services, including an exception for a minor age 12 years or older to consent to medical care related to the prevention of a sexually transmitted disease, for medical care and counseling relating to the diagnosis and treatment of a drug- or alcohol-related problem, or for medical care related to an injury caused by intimate partner violence. In addition, Health and Safety Code 124260 allows a minor age 12 or older to consent to outpatient mental health services if, in the opinion of a professional person, as defined, the minor is mature enough to participate intelligently in the mental health treatment or counseling services. In this case, the child's parent/guardian must be involved unless the professional person determines it would be inappropriate.
The Superintendent or designee shall obtain written parent/guardian consent prior to providing services to a student, except when the student is authorized to consent to the service pursuant to Family Code 6920-6930, Health and Safety Code 124260, or other applicable law.

CSBA NOTE: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (45 CFR 164.500-164.534) mandates actions that "covered entities" must take to protect the privacy of an individual's health information. Generally, entities covered by HIPAA may release or receive "protected health information" about an individual only if that individual gives permission or the Act expressly permits its release. Districts with questions about the applicability of HIPAA should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel as appropriate.Additionally, the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) (Civil Code 56-56.37) prohibits a health care provider, a health care service plan, or contractor from disclosing medical information without first obtaining permission of the individual. Civil Code 56.10, as amended by SB 1184 (Ch. 993, Statutes of 2022), authorizes a health care provider or a health care service plan to disclose medical information that complies with HIPAA to a school-linked services coordinator, pursuant to a written authorization between the health provider and the student. A "school-linked services coordinator" means an individual located on a school campus or under contract by a county behavioral health provider agency for the treatment and health care operations and referrals of students and their families that holds one of the following credentials or licenses: pupil personnel services, school nurse, marriage and family therapy, educational psychology, or professional clinical counseling.In addition, 22 CCR 51270 requires districts serving as Medi-Cal providers to comply with confidentiality requirements specified in Education Code 46090 and 49073-49079, Welfare and Institutions Code 14100.2, 22 CCR 51009, 42 USC 1320c-9, and 42 CFR 431.300; see the section entitled "Payment/Reimbursement for Services" below. Also see the accompanying administrative regulation regarding additional requirements for Medi-Cal billing, including the requirement to enter into a Provider Participation Agreement and Annual Report with the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS).Pursuant to Education Code 49428.15, CDE is required to recommend best practices and identify evidence-based and evidence-informed training programs for schools to address student behavioral health, including instruction on how to maintain student privacy and confidentiality, consistent with federal and state privacy laws. CDE has identified such a training program, "Youth Mental Health First Aid," which is available on its website.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain the confidentiality of student health records in accordance with law.

Payment/Reimbursement for Services

CSBA NOTE: Some school health services, such as medical and related services specified in an individualized education program for students with disabilities, must be provided free of charge. For other services, districts may charge a fee and are entitled to seek third-party reimbursement from students' private insurance and state or federal programs such as Medi-Cal or the Child Health and Disability Prevention program. See the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Superintendent or designee may bill public and private insurance programs and other applicable programs for reimbursement of services as appropriate. Services may be provided free of charge or on a sliding scale in accordance with law.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that have received approval from the DHCS to serve as Medi-Cal providers. Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code 14132.06 and 22 CCR 51051 and 51190.1, to the extent that federal funding is available, local educational agencies (LEAs) may receive partial Medi-Cal reimbursement through the LEA Medi-Cal Billing Option for health services provided to an enrolled student under age 22 who is certified for Medi-Cal and/or a member of the student's family. In addition, pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code 14132.47, LEAs may be reimbursed through the Medi-Cal Administrative Activities (MAA) program for some of their administrative costs associated with school-based health and outreach activities that are not claimable under the LEA Medi-Cal Billing Option or other programs. See the accompanying administrative regulation.Districts may receive assistance with Medi-Cal billing through CSBA's Practi-Cal program. See CSBA's website for further information.
The district shall serve as a Medi-Cal provider to the extent feasible, comply with all related legal requirements, and seek reimbursement of costs to the extent allowed by law.

Program Evaluation

In order to continuously improve school health services, the Board shall evaluate the effectiveness of such services and the extent to which they continue to meet student needs.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board with periodic reports that may include, but are not necessarily limited to, rates of participation in school health services; changes in student outcomes such as school attendance or achievement; measures of school climate; feedback from staff and participants regarding program accessibility and operations, including accessibility to low-income and linguistically and culturally diverse students and families; and program costs and revenues.

<strong>Consent and Confidentiality</strong><br>
<br>
<div id='UNg896' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Parent/guardian consent is generally required prior to providing health services to a minor student. However, Family Code 6920-6930 specify exceptions under which minors do not need parent/guardian consent prior to receiving services, including an exception for a minor age 12 years or older to consent to medical care related to the prevention of a sexually transmitted disease, for medical care and counseling relating to the diagnosis and treatment of a drug- or alcohol-related problem, or for medical care related to an injury caused by intimate partner violence. In addition, Health and Safety Code 124260 allows a minor age 12 or older to consent to outpatient mental health services if, in the opinion of a professional person, as defined, the minor is mature enough to participate intelligently in the mental health treatment or counseling services. In this case, the child's parent/guardian must be involved unless the professional person determines it would be inappropriate.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MMDgMg0" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MMDgMg0%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22UNg896%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1686777388%2C%22text%22%3A%22Parent/guardian%20consent%20is%20generally%20required%20prior%20to%20providing%20health%20services%20to%20a%20minor%20student.%20However%2C%20Family%20Code%206920-6930%20specify%20exceptions%20under%20which%20minors%20do%20not%20need%20parent/guardian%20consent%20prior%20to%20receiving%20services%2C%20including%20an%20exception%20for%20a%20minor%20age%2012%20years%20or%20older%20to%20consent%20to%20medical%20care%20related%20to%20the%20prevention%20of%20a%20sexually%20transmitted%20disease%2C%20for%20medical%20care%20and%20counseling%20relating%20to%20the%20diagnosis%20and%20treatment%20of%20a%20drug-%20or%20alcohol-related%20problem%2C%20or%20for%20medical%20care%20related%20to%20an%20injury%20caused%20by%20intimate%20partner%20violence.%20In%20addition%2C%20Health%20and%20Safety%20Code%20124260%20allows%20a%20minor%20age%2012%20or%20older%20to%20consent%20to%20outpatient%20mental%20health%20services%20if%2C%20in%20the%20opinion%20of%20a%20professional%20person%2C%20as%20defined%2C%20the%20minor%20is%20mature%20enough%20to%20participate%20intelligently%20in%20the%20mental%20health%20treatment%20or%20counseling%20services.%20In%20this%20case%2C%20the%20child%27s%20parent/guardian%20must%20be%20involved%20unless%20the%20professional%20person%20determines%20it%20would%20be%20inappropriate.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MMDgMg0" title="CSBA NOTE: Parent/guardian consent is generally re..."></annotation><br style="display:none">

<div id='yMg897' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (45 CFR 164.500-164.534) mandates actions that "covered entities" must take to protect the privacy of an individual's health information. Generally, entities covered by HIPAA may release or receive "protected health information" about an individual only if that individual gives permission or the Act expressly permits its release. Districts with questions about the applicability of HIPAA should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel as appropriate.<br><br>Additionally, the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) (Civil Code 56-56.37) prohibits a health care provider, a health care service plan, or contractor from disclosing medical information without first obtaining permission of the individual. Civil Code 56.10, as amended by SB 1184 (Ch. 993, Statutes of 2022), authorizes a health care provider or a health care service plan to disclose medical information that complies with HIPAA to a school-linked services coordinator, pursuant to a written authorization between the health provider and the student. A "school-linked services coordinator" means an individual located on a school campus or under contract by a county behavioral health provider agency for the treatment and health care operations and referrals of students and their families that holds one of the following credentials or licenses: pupil personnel services, school nurse, marriage and family therapy, educational psychology, or professional clinical counseling.<br><br>In addition, 22 CCR 51270 requires districts serving as Medi-Cal providers to comply with confidentiality requirements specified in Education Code 46090 and 49073-49079, Welfare and Institutions Code 14100.2, 22 CCR 51009, 42 USC 1320c-9, and 42 CFR 431.300; see the section entitled "Payment/Reimbursement for Services" below. Also see the accompanying administrative regulation regarding additional requirements for Medi-Cal billing, including the requirement to enter into a Provider Participation Agreement and Annual Report with the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS).<br><br>Pursuant to Education Code 49428.15, CDE is required to recommend best practices and identify evidence-based and evidence-informed training programs for schools to address student behavioral health, including instruction on how to maintain student privacy and confidentiality, consistent with federal and state privacy laws.
