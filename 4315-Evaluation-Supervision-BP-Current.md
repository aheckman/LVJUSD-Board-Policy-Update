## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35171 mandates that the Governing Board adopt reasonable regulations related to evaluating the performance of certificated personnel, including certificated administrative and supervisory personnel.  The following policy addresses the evaluation of both certificated and classified administrative and supervisory personnel and should be revised to reflect district practice. For policy related to the evaluation of the Superintendent, see BP 2140 - Evaluation of the Superintendent.
The Governing Board believes that regular, comprehensive evaluations designed to hold administrative and supervisory staff accountable for their performance are key to improving their instructional leadership and management skills. Evaluations shall be linked to the district's vision and goals and school improvement plans.

Evaluations shall be used to recognize the exemplary skills and accomplishments of administrative and supervisory employees, serve as a criterion for contract renewals, and identify areas needing improvement. When the evaluation indicates areas needing improvement, the Board expects employees to take the initiative to improve their performance and for their supervisors to assist them in obtaining needed job skills.

CSBA NOTE: Administrative and supervisory personnel covered by employee contracts (see BP 4312.1 - Contracts) must be evaluated in accordance with any related contract provisions. If the district has recognized a bargaining unit of supervisory employees (see BP 4140/4240/4340 - Bargaining Units), evaluation procedures for those employees are subject to negotiation pursuant to Government Code 3543.2.  The following paragraph should be revised to reflect district practice.
Administrative and supervisory employees shall be evaluated in accordance with provisions of employee contracts and/or applicable collective bargaining agreements as appropriate.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35171 requires the district to make available to certificated employees written regulations related to evaluation; see AR 4115 - Evaluation/Supervision and E 4112.9 - Employee Notifications. The following paragraph extends the distribution of these regulations to all administrative and supervisory employees, including classified personnel, and may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Superintendent or designee shall make written evaluation procedures available to all administrative and supervisory employees.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph, including the frequency of evaluations, should be revised to reflect district practice and any applicable collective bargaining agreement with supervisory employees.  Education Code 44670 authorizes the Board to identify an evaluator for each principal, require annual evaluations for the first and second year of employment as a new principal in the district, and establish the frequency of evaluations after the first two years of employment. Education Code 44670 also authorizes the evaluator and principal to agree upon additional evaluations outside of the regular intervals determined by the Board.
An employee shall be evaluated annually for the first and second years of employment as an administrator or supervisor in the district, and at least every two years thereafter, unless otherwise provided for in an employee contract or collective bargaining agreement. Evaluations may occur between scheduled periods at the request of the employee, his/her supervisor, or the Superintendent or designee.

The Superintendent or designee shall establish clear, objective criteria for evaluation based on the job responsibilities of each administrative or supervisory position.

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-9 below are optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.  Pursuant to Education Code 44671, criteria for evaluation of principals may be based on the California Professional Standards for Educational Leaders (CPSEL) and the criteria listed below.  As adopted by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing in February 2014, the CPSEL describe the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by school administrators with respect to the development and implementation of a shared vision, instructional leadership, management and learning environment, family and community engagement, ethics and integrity, and external context and policy; see E 4319.21 - Professional Standards.
Evaluation criteria for certificated school site administrators may be based on the California Professional Standards for Educational Leaders (CPSEL) and also may include, but not be limited to, evidence of:  (Education Code 44671)

	Academic growth of students, based on multiple measures which may include student work as well as student and school longitudinal data that demonstrate academic growth over time
	
	Assessments used for this purpose shall be valid and reliable and used for the intended purposes and for the appropriate student populations.  Local and state academic assessments may include, but are not limited to, state standardized assessments and formative, summative, benchmark, end-of-chapter, end-of-course, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, college entrance, and performance assessments.
	 
	Effective and comprehensive teacher evaluations, including, but not limited to, curricular and management leadership, ongoing professional development, teacher-principal teamwork, and professional learning communities
	 
	Culturally responsive instructional strategies to address and eliminate the achievement gap
	 
	The ability to analyze quality instructional strategies and provide effective feedback that leads to instructional improvement
	 
	High expectations for all students and leadership to ensure active student engagement and learning
	 
	Collaborative professional practices for improving instructional strategies
	 
	Effective school management, including personnel and resource management, organizational leadership, sound fiscal practices, a safe campus environment, and appropriate student behavior
	 
	Meaningful self-assessment to improve as a professional educator, which may include, but not be limited to, a self-assessment based on the CPSEL and the identification of areas of strengths and areas for professional growth to engage in activities to foster professional growth
	 
	Consistent and effective relationships with students, parents/guardians, teachers, staff, and other administrators

The evaluation shall be dated and signed by the employee and evaluator.  The employee may respond in writing to the evaluation within a reasonable time after receiving a copy of the evaluation.  The response shall be attached to the evaluation and placed in the employee's personnel file.
