## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is optional. State law specifies behaviors for which a student may be suspended and/or recommended for expulsion; see BP/AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process. State law also authorizes the use of age-appropriate alternatives to suspension, including those listed in Education Code 48900.5 and 48900.6.Since a district's ability to meet its goals is impacted by its student discipline policies and practices, the Governing Board must be careful to enact rules that are effective in providing interventions and supports as well as maintaining safety and order on campus.The U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division (DOJ) and the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), in their joint January 2014 Dear Colleague Letter,  "Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline" (which has been under review by DOJ and OCR since July 30, 2021), states that studies have suggested a correlation between exclusionary discipline policies and practices (such as suspension and expulsion) and an array of serious educational, economic, and social problems, including school avoidance, diminished educational engagement, decreased academic achievement, increased behavior problems, and increased likelihood of dropping out, substance abuse, and involvement with the juvenile justice system. Consequently, they recommend that districts adopt alternative disciplinary measures that provide students with appropriate interventions and supports as a means for preventing and addressing student misbehavior. OCR's publication, "Resource on Confronting Racial Discrimination in Student Discipline," provides additional resources and findings.
The Governing Board is committed to providing a safe, supportive, and positive school environment which is conducive to student learning and achievement and desires to prepare students for responsible citizenship by fostering self-discipline and personal responsibility. The Board believes that high expectations for student behavior, use of effective school and classroom management strategies, provision of appropriate intervention and support, and parent/guardian involvement can minimize the need for disciplinary measures that exclude students from instruction as a means for correcting student misbehavior.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop effective, age-appropriate strategies for maintaining a positive school climate and responding appropriately to student misbehavior at district schools. The strategies shall focus on providing students with needed supports; communicating clear, appropriate, and consistent expectations and consequences for student conduct; and ensuring equity and continuous improvement in the implementation of district discipline policies and practices.

In addition, the Superintendent or designee's strategies for responding to student misconduct shall reflect the Board's preference for the use of positive interventions and alternative disciplinary measures over exclusionary discipline measures.

Disciplinary measures that may result in loss of instructional time or cause students to be disengaged from school, such as detention, suspension, and expulsion, shall be imposed only when required or permitted by law or when other means of correction have been documented to have failed.  (Education Code 48900.5)

School personnel and volunteers shall not allow any disciplinary action taken against a student to result in the denial or delay of a school meal.  (Education Code 49557.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49056, as added by SB 291 (Ch. 863, Statutes of 2023), beginning with the 2024-2025 school year, a student may not be denied recess unless the student's participation poses an immediate threat to the physical safety of the student or to the physical safety of one or more of the student's peers. Education Code 44807.5, which authorized the Board to permit the use of recess restriction for disciplinary purposes, was repealed by SB 291.
A student shall not be denied recess unless the student's participation poses an immediate threat to the physical safety of the student or to the physical safety of one or more of the student's peers. If, due to such immediate threat, a student is denied recess, staff shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve the threat and minimize the student's exclusion from recess, to the greatest extent practicable.  (Education Code 49056)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49005.2, use of seclusion and behavioral restraint as a means of discipline is prohibited. Education Code 49005.4 provides that seclusion or behavioral restraint may only be used to control behavior that poses a clear and present danger of serious physical harm to a student or others that cannot be immediately prevented by a less restrictive response. See AR 5131.41 - Use of Seclusion and Restraint.
Seclusion and behavioral restraint are prohibited as a means of discipline and shall not be used to correct student behavior except as permitted pursuant to Education Code 49005.4 and in accordance with district regulations.  (Education Code 49005.2)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. According to Public Counsel's model policy issued as part of the Fix School Discipline Project, a discipline matrix that lists violations and consequences could be a useful guide to school site administrators with regard to when suspension or expulsion referrals should be utilized.
The Superintendent or designee shall create a model discipline matrix that lists violations and the consequences for each as allowed by law.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35291.5 authorizes, but does not require, school sites to adopt rules and procedures for student discipline. Pursuant to Education Code 32282, any adopted site-level discipline rules must be included in the comprehensive safety plan; see BP/AR 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan. The following paragraph is optional.
The principal or designee at each school may develop disciplinary rules to meet the school's particular needs consistent with law, Board policy, and administrative regulations. The Board, at an open meeting, may review the approved school discipline rules for consistency with Board policy and state law. Site-level disciplinary rules shall be included in the district's comprehensive safety plan.  (Education Code 32282, 35291.5)

At all times, the safety of students and staff, providing interventions and supports to students, as well as the maintenance of an orderly school environment, shall be priorities in determining appropriate discipline. When misconduct occurs, staff shall attempt to identify the causes of the student's behavior and implement appropriate support and/or discipline. When choosing between different disciplinary strategies, staff shall consider the effect of each option on the student's health, well-being, and opportunity to learn.

Staff shall enforce disciplinary rules fairly, consistently, and in accordance with the district's nondiscrimination policies.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide professional development as necessary to assist staff in developing the skills needed to effectively and equitably implement the disciplinary strategies adopted for district schools, including, but not limited to, knowledge of school and classroom management skills and their consistent application, effective accountability and positive intervention techniques, and the tools to form strong, cooperative relationships with parents/guardians.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52060, the district must annually adopt a local control and accountability plan that includes a description of district goals for improving school climate, as provided in the following paragraph.
District goals for improving school climate, based on suspension and expulsion rates, surveys of students, staff, and parents/guardians regarding their sense of school safety and connectedness to the school community, and other local measures, shall be included in the district's local control and accountability plan, as required by law.

At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee may report to the Board regarding disciplinary strategies used in district schools in the immediately preceding school year and their effect on student learning.
