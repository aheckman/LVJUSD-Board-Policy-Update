Requirements for Schools Not Participating in Federal Meal Program

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that have one or more schools that do not participate in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program (42 USC 1751-1769j, 1773). Requirements for other schools are described below in the section "Requirements for Schools Participating in Federal Meal Program."Food sales outside the district's food service program that occur on school premises during the school day are subject to the nutrition standards specified in Education Code 49431-49431.7, as amended by AB 626 (Ch. 706, Statutes of 2013). These include nutrition standards for foods in elementary schools (Education Code 49431) and middle and high schools (Education Code 49431.2) and for beverages in all schools (Education Code 49431.5), as well as a prohibition against the sale of foods containing artificial trans fat at any grade level (Education Code 49431.7). See AR 3550 - Food Service/Child Nutrition Program for further information regarding nutrition standards.
Food and beverage sales outside the district's food service program shall comply with applicable nutritional standards specified in Education Code 49431-49431.7 and 5 CCR 15500-15501 and 15575-15578.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49431-49431.5, foods and beverages that do not comply with state nutrition standards may be sold outside of the district's food services program under certain conditions. As amended by AB 626 (Ch. 706, Statutes of 2013), Education Code 49431-49431.5 provide that the same requirements apply to sales of both foods and beverages and to all grade levels. AB 626 also amended Education Code 49431 and 49431.5 to eliminate the requirement that sales of noncompliant foods and beverages in elementary schools only be allowed if the items are sold by students of the school.
The sale of foods or beverages that do not comply with the standards in Education Code 49431-49431.5 may be permitted in either of the following circumstances:  (Education Code 49431-49431.5)

	The sale takes place off and away from school premises.
	 
	The sale takes place on school premises at least one-half hour after the end of the school day.

Requirements for Schools Participating in Federal Meal Program

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that have one or more schools participating in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program (42 USC 1751-1769j, 1773). 7 CFR 210.11 and 220.12 mandate that such districts adopt rules and regulations to ensure compliance with federal requirements for competitive foods.Pursuant to 42 USC 1779, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture has established nutrition standards which are consistent with the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans and apply to all foods sold outside the school meal programs on school campuses at any time during the school day. These standards are contained in 7 CFR 210.11 and 220.12, as amended by 78 Fed. Reg. 125, and must be implemented by July 1, 2014.Note that, in some instances, state nutrition standards (Education Code 49431-49431.7) may be stricter than federal standards. In such cases, the stricter standard prevails. In addition, although 7 CFR 210.11 and 220.12 allow states to adopt criteria for special exemptions from nutrition standard compliance for infrequent school-sponsored fundraisers, the California Department of Education (CDE) provides no exemption. Thus, all infrequent school-sponsored fundraisers are subject to the same rules as other outside food sales.
For any district school participating in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program, food and beverage sales conducted outside the district's food service program on school campuses during the school day shall comply with applicable nutritional standards specified in 7 CFR 210.11 and 220.12 or with state nutrition standards in Education Code 49431-49431.7 and 5 CCR 15500-15501 and 15575-15578, whichever rule is stricter.

CSBA NOTE: As amended by 78 Fed. Reg. 125, 7 CFR 210.11 adds the following definition of "school day" for purposes of the regulations governing competitive food and beverage sales.
These standards shall apply to all competitive foods and beverages sold from midnight before the school day to one-half hour after the end of the school day.  (7 CFR 210.11)

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section reflects 5 CCR 15500-15501 pertaining to sales by student organizations in schools that participate in a federal meal program, but delegates to the Superintendent or designee the responsibility for approval of the specific food item to be sold; see the accompanying Board policy.To the extent that any Title 5 requirement conflicts with the nutrition standards specified in Education Code 49431-49431.7 or federal law, the stricter standard prevails. Thus, although 5 CCR 15500 provides that a student organization may only sell a dessert-type item, such as a pastry, ice cream, or fruit, stricter state and federal nutrition standards supersede and so this provision is not reflected in the list below. Items #1-6 below are for use by districts that maintain any of grades K-8.
In a school with any of grades K-8 that is participating in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program, the Superintendent or designee shall not permit the sale of foods by a student organization except when all of the following conditions are met:  (5 CCR 15500)


	The student organization sells only one food item per sale.
	 
	The specific nutritious food item is approved by the Superintendent or designee in accordance with Board policy.
	 
	The sale does not begin until after the close of the regularly scheduled midday food service period.
	 
	 The sale during the regular school day is not of food items prepared on the premises.
	 
	There are no more than four such sales per year per school.
	 
	The food sold is not one sold in the district's food service program at that school during that school day.

CSBA NOTE: Items #1-4 below are for use by districts that maintain middle schools or high schools.
In any middle or high school, a student organization may be approved to sell food items during or after the school day if all of the following conditions are met:  (5 CCR 15501)


	Only one student organization conducts a food sale on a given school day and the organization sells no more than three types of food or beverage items, except that up to four days during the school year may be designated on which any number of organizations may conduct the sale of any food items.
	 
	The specific nutritious food items are approved by the Superintendent or designee in accordance with Board policy.
	 
	Food items sold during the regular school day are not prepared on the premises.
	 
	The food items sold are not those sold in the district's food service program at that school during that school day.

CSBA NOTE: 7 CFR 210.11, as amended by 78 Fed. Reg. 125, requires the district to maintain specified records.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records, and shall require organizations selling foods and beverages to maintain records, to document compliance with federal nutrition standards for all competitive foods and beverages sold through and outside the district's food services program.  At a minimum, these records shall include receipts, nutrition labels, and/or product specifications.  (7 CFR 210.11)
