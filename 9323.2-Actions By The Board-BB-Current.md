## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35164 and Government Code 54952.6, a simple majority vote of the membership of the Governing Board is necessary for an item to carry, even in those cases where some members are absent or seats are vacant. For instance, for districts with a five-member board, an item will pass with three votes, even if only three members are present or there is a vacancy. Education Code 35165 details the effect of a vacancy in districts with a seven-member board. For language regarding vote requirements when a board member abstains, see BB 9323 - Meeting Conduct. However, there are certain actions by the Board that require more than a simple majority vote, or that are required to occur, or may not occur, at a certain meeting or type of meeting; see E(1) 9323.2 for a non-exhaustive list of such actions.
The Governing Board shall act by a majority vote of all of the membership constituting the Board, unless otherwise required by law.  (Education Code 35164, 35165)

An "action" by the Board means:  (Government Code 54952.6)

	A collective decision by a majority of the Board members
	 
	A collective commitment or promise by a majority of the Board members to make a positive or negative decision
	 
	A vote by a majority of the Board members when sitting as the Board upon a motion, proposal, resolution, order, or ordinance

The Board shall not take action by secret ballot, whether preliminary or final.  (Government Code 54953)

Actions taken by the Board in open session shall be recorded in the Board minutes.  (Education Code 35145)

Action on Non-Agenda Items

CSBA NOTE: The Brown Act (Government Code 54950-54963) generally prohibits any action or discussion of items not on the posted agenda. However, Government Code 54954.2 provides for four specific and narrow situations in which the Board can act on an item not on the agenda, as specified below. Board members may also briefly respond to questions raised by members of the public concerning items not on the agenda; see BB 9323 - Meeting Conduct.
The Board may take action on a subject not appearing on the posted meeting agenda only after publicly identifying the item and if any one of the following conditions are met:  (Government Code 54954.2)

	When a majority of the Board determines that an emergency situation exists, as defined for emergency meetings pursuant to Government Code 54956.5
	 
	When two-thirds of the members present, or if less than two-thirds of the members are present then by a unanimous vote of all members present, determine that the need to take immediate action came to the district's attention after the agenda was posted
	 
	When an item appeared on the agenda of, and was continued from, a meeting that occurred not more than five days earlier
	
	CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54954.2 provides that the Board may take action on a request by a Board member to participate by teleconference due to emergency circumstances pursuant to Government Code 54953 so long as the timing of the request did not allow for sufficient time to place it on the agenda. If the timing of the request did allow for sufficient time to place it on the agenda, it cannot be acted upon unless it was agendized. For more information regarding Board meetings by teleconference, see Board Bylaw 9320 - Meetings And Notices.
	Until December 31, 2025, when a Board member requests to participate by teleconference due to emergency circumstances pursuant to Government Code 54953 so long as the timing of the request did not allow for sufficient time to place it on the agenda

Challenging Board Actions

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 54960-54960.5 grants authority to the district attorney or any interested person to file a civil action asking the court to order the Board to stop or prevent a Brown Act violation or to invalidate a prior action taken by the Board. Pursuant to Government Code 54960.5, a court may award court costs and reasonable attorney's fees to a successful plaintiff. Prior to filing a civil action, the district attorney or interested party must send a written demand to the Board to "cure and correct" the alleged violation or prior action. The Board should consult with CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel as appropriate.
Before seeking to file a civil action to stop or prevent a Brown Act violation or to invalidate a prior action taken by the Board, the district attorney's office or interested person shall first present a demand to "cure and correct" the alleged violation to the district. If the district receives a proper demand from the district attorney's office or any interested person to "cure and correct" an alleged violation of the Brown Act, the Board shall consult with legal counsel on if and how to respond as provided by law.  (Government Code 54960-54960.5)
