## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation addresses postretirement employment restrictions and benefits which are applicable by law when retired members of the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) are hired by the district after their retirement.
When necessary, the Governing Board may hire a qualified retired certificated individual who possesses the knowledge and experience needed to perform creditable service for the district as an employee, the employee of a third party, or an independent contractor/consultant, provided that all applicable restrictions specified by the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) are met.  Applicable CalSTRS restrictions include, but are not limited to, a requirement that a retired member be paid compensation comparable to that for active employees for comparable duties and prohibitions against the hiring of a retired member within 180 days of his/her retirement and for the classified service, except as an aide pursuant to Education Code 45134.  Additional restrictions and rules may apply to other employment situations, such as when CalSTRS retired members are employed as employees of third parties, independent contractors, or consultants.  The Superintendent or designee should consult legal counsel when dealing with such employment situations.  (Education Code 22119.5, 22164.5, 24214, 24214.5)

Any retired member of the defined benefit program of CalSTRS who is hired by the district to perform retired member activities as defined pursuant to Education Code 22164.5 shall be paid at an annualized rate of pay that shall not be below the minimum or exceed the maximum paid to other district employees performing comparable duties.  However, such a retired individual shall not make contributions to the CalSTRS retirement fund or accrue service credit based on compensation earned from the retired member activity.  (Education Code 24214)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 24214.5, retired CalSTRS members may be hired to perform work that would normally accrue service credit in CalSTRS (creditable service) as long as the work commences more than 180 days after the member's retirement.  Such retired individuals are allowed to receive compensation for services rendered without reduction in their retirement allowance if the compensation does not exceed the CalSTRS earnings limit. However, a retired CalSTRS member may be exempted from the 180-day waiting period if he/she has attained the normal retirement age and certain other conditions are met, as listed in items #1-6 below.  Even if a retired individual is exempted from the 180-day waiting period, he/she shall still be subject to the postretirement compensation limitation specified in Education Code 24214.
No retired member of the CalSTRS defined benefit program shall be hired by the district for at least 180 calendar days after his/her retirement from service, unless he/she has attained the normal retirement age and qualifies for an exemption to the 180-day waiting period.  To seek this exemption, the Board shall, during the open session of a Board meeting, adopt a resolution which shall include the following information and findings:  (Education Code 24214.5)

	A statement expressing the Board's intent to seek an exemption to the 180-day waiting period
	 
	A description of the nature of the employment of the retiree
	 
	A finding that the retiree has reached the normal retirement age
	 
	A finding that the appointment of the retiree is necessary to fill a critically needed position before the 180-day waiting period has passed
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 24214.5 requires a finding that the retired individual did not receive additional service credit or a financial inducement to retire, as provided in item #5 below.  Pursuant to Education Code 24214.5, as amended by AB 1381 (Ch. 559, Statutes of 2013), "financial inducement to retire" is defined broadly and includes any form of compensation or other payment paid to a retired member directly or indirectly by "any public employer," not just the district needing to employ the retired member.
	A finding that the retired individual did not receive additional service credit pursuant to Education Code 22714 or 22715 or any financial inducement to retire.  Financial inducement to retire shall include, but is not limited to, cash or any form of compensation or other payment directly or indirectly paid by any public employer to the retired individual before or after his/her retirement, if the individual retires for service on or before a specific date or range of dates established by the public employer on or before the date the inducement is offered
	 
	A finding that the retired individual's termination of employment with the district is not the basis for the need to acquire the services of the retired individual

The resolution shall not be adopted through the Board's consent agenda.  (Education Code 24214.5)

When employing a retired individual who is eligible for exemption from the 180-day waiting period, the Superintendent or designee shall submit all required documentation to substantiate eligibility for the exemption to CalSTRS before the retired member begins performing any retired member activities.  The Superintendent or designee may contact

CalSTRS to request information as to whether the retired member qualifies for the exemption after 30 days of submitting the required documentation to CalSTRS.  (Education Code 24214.5)
CSBA NOTE: Special rules apply to the hiring of an individual receiving a CalSTRS disability allowance and the district should consult CalSTRS and legal counsel prior to employing any such disability allowance recipient.

Postretirement Compensation Limitation, Notice, and Report

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 22461, as amended by AB 1379 (Ch. 558, Statutes of 2013), a district is required to notify retired individuals of the employment restrictions and the CalSTRS postretirement compensation limitation as specified in the following section.  However, the statute expressly states that it does not impose liability upon the district for any amount paid in excess of the limitation or for failing to inform the retired individual that continuation of service would exceed the limitation.
All CalSTRS retirees performing creditable service for the district shall be subject to the applicable CalSTRS earnings limit.  Monies earned in excess of the limit may subject the CalSTRS retiree to a reduction in his/her retirement allowance.  Compensation subject to the earnings limitation includes, but is not limited to, salary or wages, deferred compensation plans, purchase of an annuity contract, tax-deferred retirement plan or insurance program, and other plans or contributions when the cost is covered by a district.  (Education Code 22119.5, 22164.5, 24214)

Whenever the district retains the services of a CalSTRS retiree as a district employee, employee of a third party, or an independent contractor, the Superintendent or designee shall:  (Education Code 22461, 24214)


	Advise the retired individual of the postretirement earnings limitation or employment restriction set forth in Education Code 22714, 24214, or 24214.5 or any other applicable law
	 
	Maintain accurate records of the retired individual's compensation and report it monthly to CalSTRS and the individual, regardless of the method of payment or the fund from which the payments are made
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 27000-27009, CalSTRS has the authority to impose penalties on employers for late reporting of retired members' contributions. However, since retirees no longer contribute to CalSTRS, the penalties may be inapplicable.
