## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.1 mandates districts to adopt policy as well as a process to ensure that district programs and activities are free from unlawful discrimination. Education Code 234.1 requires that the district's nondiscrimination policy include a statement that the policy applies to all acts related to a school activity or school attendance and, as amended by AB 1078 (Ch. 229, Statutes of 2023), to all acts of the Governing Board and the Superintendent in enacting policies and procedures that govern the district. Education Code 234.1, as amended by AB 1078, contains similar language regarding the County Board of Education and the County Superintendent of Schools.In accordance with various provisions of state and federal law, discrimination in education programs and activities is unlawful when it is based on certain actual or perceived characteristics of an individual. Education Code 220 prohibits discrimination based on race or ethnicity, nationality, immigration status, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, religion, disability, or any other characteristic contained in the definition of hate crimes in Penal Code 422.55. Education Code 260 prohibits discrimination based on age. Government Code 11135 prohibits discrimination based on many of the foregoing characteristics and on an individual's genetic information and medical condition. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000d-2000d-7) prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin. Title IX (20 USC 1681-1688; 34 CFR 106.1-106.82, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474) prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, including sex stereotypes; sex characteristics; gender; gender identity; sexual orientation; pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation, including related medical conditions or recovery; and parental, marital, and family status. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 USC 12101-12213) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 794) prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. For policy language protecting students against discrimination and harassment, see BP/AR 5145.3 - Nondiscrimination/Harassment and BP/AR 5145.7 - Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment, and for language regarding Title IX complaint procedures, see AR 5145.71 - Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures.Education Code 260 and 5 CCR 4900-4965 require the Board to monitor district compliance with these state and federal laws. The federal laws are enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE), and the California Department of Education (CDE) may investigate complaints regarding discrimination pursuant to 5 CCR 4600-4670.OCR's May 2024 Dear Colleague Letter, "Protecting Students from Discrimination, such as Harassment, Based on Race, Color, or National Origin, Including Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics," which expands and clarifies USDOE's 2023, "Guidance on Constitutionally Protected Prayer and Religious Expression in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools," provides that Title VI's protections from race, color, and national origin discrimination extends to students who experience discrimination based on actual or perceived (1) shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, or (2) citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct religious identity. While Title VI does not protect individuals based solely on religious discrimination, it does apply to antisemitism and other forms of discrimination when based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. The guidance includes clarifying examples regarding existing legal requirements under Title VI.Additionally, OCR's November 2023 Dear Colleague Letter, "Discrimination, Including Harassment, Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics," states that all students, including students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, or Palestinian, as well as students who come from, or are perceived to come from, all regions of the world, are entitled to a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. The Dear Colleague Letter provides that Title VI also protects students from discrimination which is based on (1) actual or perceived citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct religious identity, including Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist students, when the discrimination involves racial, ethnic, or ancestral slurs or stereotypes, (2) a student's skin color, physical features, or style of dress that reflects both ethnic and religious traditions, and (3) where a student came from or is perceived to have come from. Discrimination based on a student's foreign accent, foreign name, or a student speaking a foreign language may also violate Title VI's prohibitions against discrimination.OCR's August 2023 Dear Colleague Letter, "Race and School Programming," states that a district may not separate students based on race, but may include group discussions or activities that focus on race as part of the curriculum, courses, or programs so long as access or participation is not permitted or limited based on race. OCR's guidance also provides that a school-sponsored program with emphasis on race, such as a student club, that is open to all students, typically would not violate Title VI solely because of its race-related theme.Additionally, OCR's May 2023 Dear Colleague Letter, "Resource on Confronting Racial Discrimination in Student Discipline," published in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), states that a district's responsibility not to discriminate against students applies to any of its programs or activities, whether directly or through contractual or other arrangements.In addition to the prohibitions to discrimination described above, Government Code 12940 provides protections for employees, job applicants, unpaid interns, and volunteers against unlawful discrimination and harassment on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, national origin, age, religious creed, marital status, reproductive health decisionmaking, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, veteran or military status, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or gender expression.For policy language regarding Title IX complaint procedures for employees, see AR 4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 -  Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures, for language addressing protections against discrimination as they relate to employees, unpaid interns, and job applicants, see BP 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment and BP 4119.11/4219.11/4319.11 - Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment, and as they relate to volunteers, see BP 1240 - Volunteer Assistance.
This policy shall apply to all acts related to a school activity or school attendance and to all acts of the Governing Board and the Superintendent in enacting policies and procedures that govern the district.

The Board is committed to providing equal opportunity for all individuals in district programs and activities. District programs, activities, and practices shall be free from unlawful discrimination, including discrimination against an individual or group based on race; color; ancestry; nationality; national origin; immigration status; ethnic group identification; ethnicity; age; religion; pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation, including related medical conditions and recovery; parental, family, or marital status; reproductive health decisionmaking; physical or mental disability; medical condition; sex; sex stereotypes; sex characteristics; sexual orientation; gender; gender identity; gender expression; veteran or military status; or genetic information; a perception of one or more of such characteristics; or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.7 mandates that districts adopt policy consistent with the California Attorney General's model policy contained in the Office of the Attorney General's publication, "Promoting a Safe and Secure Learning Environment for All: Guidance and Model Policies to Assist California's K-12 Schools in Responding to Immigration Issues." That model policy includes statements regarding the equitable provision of services and a prohibition against the use of school resources or data for creating a registry based on specific characteristics. In addition, Government Code 8310.3 prohibits districts from disclosing information about immigration status or religion to federal government authorities for use in the compilation of a registry for immigration enforcement or otherwise assisting in the creation of such a registry. For more information regarding this mandate and appropriate responses to citizenship and immigration concerns, see BP/AR 5145.13 - Response to Immigration Enforcement.
All individuals shall be treated equitably in the receipt of district and school services. Personally identifiable information collected in the implementation of any district program, including, but not limited to, student and family information for the free and reduced-price lunch program, transportation, or any other educational program, shall be used only for the purposes of the program, except when the Superintendent or designee authorizes its use for another purpose in accordance with law. Resources and data collected by the district shall not be used, directly or by others, to compile a list, registry, or database of individuals based on any of the categories identified above.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 243, as added by AB 1078, clarifies when it is unlawful discrimination for the Board to (1) refuse to approve the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or resource in a school library, or (2) prohibit the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or resource in a school library. The Board may not refuse to approve such use on the basis that the material includes a study of the role and contributions of specified individuals or groups, unless the study of the role and contributions reflects adversely upon legally protected groups. Additionally, the Board may not prohibit such use on the basis that the study of the role and contributions contain inclusive or diverse perspectives. Any Board action to ban or censor a textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction on any of the bases described above may constitute unlawful discrimination under Education Code 220. In addition, pursuant to Education Code 244, as added by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), the Board is prohibited from adopting or approving the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or curriculum for classroom instruction if the use would subject a student to unlawful discrimination pursuant to Education Code 220.Education Code 242, as added by AB 1078, requires CDE to develop, by July 1, 2025, guidance and public educational materials to ensure that all Californians can access information about educational laws and policies that safeguard the right to an accurate and inclusive curriculum.For more information regarding instructional materials adoption see BP/AR/E(1) 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional materials, CSBA's publication, "Instructional Materials Adoptions: State and local governing board processes, roles, and responsibilities," and corresponding Fact Sheet and Reference, and the California Attorney General's, "Guidance to School Officials re: Legal Requirements for Providing Inclusive Curricula and Books."
District programs and activities shall be free of any discriminatory use, selection, or rejection of textbooks, instructional materials, library books, or similar educational resources.

The use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library shall not be rejected or prohibited by the Board or district on the basis that it includes a study of the role and contributions of any individual or group consistent with the requirements of Education Code 51204.5 and 60040, unless such study would violate Education Code 51501 or 60044.  (Education Code 243)

Additionally, the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library shall not be adopted by the Board or district if the use would subject a student to unlawful discrimination as specified in Education Code 220.  (Education Code 244)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 221.2-221.3, the California Racial Mascot Act, declare the use of racially derogatory or discriminatory school or athletic team names, mascots, or nicknames to be contrary to an equal education and specifically prohibit public schools from using the term "Redskins" as a school or athletic team name, mascot, or nickname. The following paragraph expands this prohibition to include any racially derogatory or discriminatory athletic team name, mascot, or nickname and may be revised to reflect district practice.
District programs and activities shall be free of any racially derogatory or discriminatory school or athletic team names, mascots, or nicknames.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 221.5, a district is required to permit a student to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, and to use facilities consistent with the student's gender identity, regardless of the student's gender as listed on the student's educational records.Additionally, Title IX, 34 CFR 106.31, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, provides that a district (1) may not exclude a student from participation in, deny a student the benefits of, or otherwise subject a student to discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity, (2) that in the limited circumstances in which different treatment or separation on the basis of sex is permitted, a district may not carry out such different treatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex by subjecting a student to more than de minimis harm, and (3) that preventing a student from participating in an education program or activity consistent with the student's gender identity would subject the student to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex. In commentary accompanying the Final Rule, USDOE clarifies that Title IX protects students from sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment, when they access sex-separate facilities. This protection applies with equal force to all students, including transgender and nonbinary students, requiring districts to provide access to sex-separate facilities, including bathrooms, in a manner that does not cause more than de minimis harm. USDOE intends to issue a separate final rule to address Title IX's application to sex-separate athletic teams which is governed by 34 CFR 106.41, rather than 34 CFR 106.31 as described above. See BP/AR 5145.7 - Sex-Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment.For further information, see CSBA's, "Legal Guidance on Rights of Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students in Schools," and CSBA's Recently Asked Questions, "Parental and Student Rights in Relation to Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students."
The Superintendent or designee shall annually review district programs and activities to ensure the removal of any derogatory or discriminatory name, image, practice, or other barrier that may unlawfully prevent an individual or group in any of the protected categories stated above from accessing district programs and activities. The Superintendent or designee shall take prompt, reasonable actions to remove any identified barrier. The Superintendent or designee shall report the findings and recommendations to the Board after each review.

CSBA NOTE: Complaints alleging discrimination based on a violation of Education Code 243, as added by AB 1078, or Education Code 244, as added by SB 153, related to the use or prohibited use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or resource in a school library, as described above, may be brought under the district's uniform complaint procedures (UCP) or may be filed directly with the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI). Complaints that are filed directly with the SPI are required to identify the basis for doing so, and present evidence that supports the basis for the direct filing. In such cases, the SPI may directly intervene without waiting for an investigation by the district. See BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.Pursuant to 34 CFR 106.11 and 106.44, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, a district with knowledge of alleged conduct, which occurs in a district program or activity on or after August 1, 2024, that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, is required to follow Title IX grievance procedures when investigating and resolving a complaint based on the alleged conduct. As such a complaint may also fall within the complaint process as specified in BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, for students, and AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment, for employees, it is unclear whether districts would additionally be required to follow the procedures specified in BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures or AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment, as applicable. Due to this uncertainty, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel prior to utilizing such a complaint process for this purpose. For more information regarding the Title IX grievance procedures, see AR 5145.71 - Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures, for students, and AR 4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 - Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures, for employees.
Except for allegations of sex discrimination or sex-based harassment, allegations of unlawful discrimination in district programs and activities shall be investigated and resolved in accordance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, for students, and Administrative Regulation 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment, for employees. Complaints alleging sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment, shall be investigated and resolved in accordance with 34 CFR 106.44 and 106.45 and as specified in Administrative Regulation 5145.71 - Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures, for students, and Administrative Regulation 4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 - Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures, for employees.

CSBA NOTE: Many nondiscrimination laws and regulations contain a notification requirement. For example, pursuant to 34 CFR 104.8 and 106.8, a district that receives federal aid is required to take "continuing steps" to notify students, parents/guardians, employees, employee organizations, and applicants for admission and employment that it does not discriminate on the basis of disability or sex in its education programs or activities. In addition, Education Code 221.61 requires districts to post specified information relating to Title IX on their websites. To ensure consistent implementation of the laws, the same notification requirement should be adopted for all the protected categories as provided in the following paragraph.
Pursuant to 34 CFR 104.8 and 106.8, the Superintendent or designee shall notify students, parents/guardians, employees, employee organizations, applicants for admission and employment, and sources of referral for applicants about the district's policy on nondiscrimination and related complaint procedures. Such notification shall be included in the annual parental notification distributed pursuant to Education Code 48980 and, as applicable, in announcements, bulletins, catalogs, handbooks, application forms, or other materials distributed by the district. The notification shall also be posted on the district's website and social media and in district schools and offices, including staff lounges, student government meeting rooms, and other prominent locations as appropriate.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.7 requires the following notification. Information about the educational rights of all students is contained in the appendix of the Office of the Attorney General's publication, "Promoting a Safe and Secure Learning Environment for All: Guidance and Model Policies to Assist California's K-12 Schools in Responding to Immigration Issues."
In addition, the annual parental notification shall inform parents/guardians of their children's right to a free public education regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs, including information on educational rights issued by the California Attorney General. Alternatively, such information may be provided through any other cost-effective means determined by the Superintendent or designee.  (Education Code 234.7)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48985, when 15 percent or more of students enrolled in a school speak a single primary language other than English, all notices and reports sent to the parents/guardians of these students must also be written in the primary language and may be answered by the parent/guardian in English or the primary language. In addition, 20 USC 6311 and 6312 require that districts receiving Title I funds provide parent/guardian notices in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, in a language that parents/guardians understand.
The district's nondiscrimination policy and related informational materials shall be published in a format that parents/guardians can understand. In addition, when 15 percent or more of a school's students speak a single primary language other than English, those materials shall be translated into that other language.  (Education Code 48985; 20 USC 6312)

Access for Individuals with Disabilities

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to the ADA and its implementing regulations, 28 CFR 35.150 and 35.151, district facilities must be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Compliance methods may include equipment redesign, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, and alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities. In achieving compliance, a district need not make structural changes to existing facilities if other methods are effective and the district can demonstrate that the structural change would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the activity or an undue financial or administrative burden. However, pursuant to 28 CFR 35.151, all newly constructed facilities must comply with the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Designs issued by the DOJ.In addition, pursuant to 28 CFR 35.136, a district must permit an individual with a disability to be accompanied by a service animal on district premises when, without the animal's assistance, the individual with a disability will not be able to access or participate in a district program or activity. For language addressing this mandate, see AR 6163.2 - Animals at School. Districts with questions about compliance with the ADA should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel as appropriate.
District programs and facilities, viewed in their entirety, shall be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and any implementing standards and/or regulations. When structural changes to existing district facilities are needed to provide individuals with disabilities access to programs, services, activities, or facilities, the Superintendent or designee shall develop a transition plan that sets forth the steps for completing the changes.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 28 CFR 35.130 and 35.160, the ADA requires districts to provide services and aids to ensure that a disabled individual is not excluded from participation or denied a benefit, service, or program on the basis of a disability. However, if the district can show that providing such aids and services would fundamentally alter the nature of the function, program, or meeting or would be an undue burden, then the district need not provide them.The requirement to provide services and aids extends to qualified individuals with speech, hearing, or vision disabilities who participate in Medi-Cal, and, in accordance with the Department of Health Care Services Policy and Procedure Letters No. 21-017R and No. 23-004, districts are required to have a plan to meet these alternative format requirements; see AR 5141.6 - School Health Services.In addition, Government Code 54953.2 requires that all Board meetings meet the protections of the ADA and implementing regulations (28 CFR 35.160 and 36.303). The district must ensure that such meetings are accessible to persons with disabilities and that, upon the request of any person with a disability, disability-related accommodations, such as auxiliary aids and services, are made available. Additionally, Government Code 54953 requires boards to maintain and implement a procedure for receiving and swiftly resolving requests for reasonable accommodation for individuals with disabilities, consistent with the ADA, and to resolve any doubt in favor of accessibility. See BB 9320 - Meetings and Notices and BB 9322 - Agenda/Meeting Materials.OCR has interpreted the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to include the requirement that district websites be accessible to individuals with disabilities. In April 2024, the DOJ published updated regulations which include specific technical standards to ensure that content available through a district's web and mobile applications are accessible to individuals with disabilities by April 26, 2027. For more information on website accessibility, see OCR's June 2010 and May 2011 Dear Colleague Letters, DOJ's April 2024, "Fact Sheet: New Rule on the Accessibility of Web Content and Mobile Apps Provided by State and Local Governments," and BP 1113 - District and School Websites.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's web and mobile applications comply with technical standards prescribed by law, and as necessary, shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services to afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to participate in or enjoy the benefits of district services, programs, or activities. These aids and services may include, but are not limited to, qualified interpreters or readers, assistive listening devices, assistive technologies or other modifications to increase accessibility to district and school websites, notetakers, written materials, taped text, and Braille or large-print materials. Individuals with disabilities shall notify the Superintendent or designee if they have a disability that requires special assistance or services. Reasonable notification should be given prior to a school-sponsored function, program, or meeting.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 28 CFR 35.107, a district that has 50 or more employees is required to designate at least one employee to coordinate the district's efforts to comply with the ADA. The designated employee could be the same individual or position responsible for the district's compliance with state and federal laws and regulations governing educational programs as identified in the district's UCP procedures. The following paragraph, which identifies the person or position identified in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures as the responsible employee, may be modified if the district chooses to designate another person or position.
The individual identified in Administrative Regulation 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures as the employee responsible for coordinating the district's response to complaints and for complying with state federal civil rights laws is hereby designated as the district's ADA coordinator. The compliance officer shall receive and address requests for accommodation submitted by individuals with disabilities, and shall investigate and resolve complaints regarding their access to district programs, services, activities, or facilities.

<body aria-readonly="false" data-gramm_editor="false" data-wsc-instance="true"><div id='yOA426' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.1 mandates districts to adopt policy as well as a process to ensure that district programs and activities are free from unlawful discrimination. Education Code 234.1 requires that the district's nondiscrimination policy include a statement that the policy applies to all acts related to a school activity or school attendance and, as amended by AB 1078 (Ch. 229, Statutes of 2023), to all acts of the Governing Board and the Superintendent in enacting policies and procedures that govern the district. Education Code 234.1, as amended by AB 1078, contains similar language regarding the County Board of Education and the County Superintendent of Schools.<br><br>In accordance with various provisions of state and federal law, discrimination in education programs and activities is unlawful when it is based on certain actual or perceived characteristics of an individual. Education Code 220 prohibits discrimination based on race or ethnicity, nationality, immigration status, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, religion, disability, or any other characteristic contained in the definition of hate crimes in Penal Code 422.55. Education Code 260 prohibits discrimination based on age. Government Code 11135 prohibits discrimination based on many of the foregoing characteristics and on an individual's genetic information and medical condition. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000d-2000d-7) prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin. Title IX (20 USC 1681-1688; 34 CFR 106.1-106.82, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474) prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, including sex stereotypes; sex characteristics; gender; gender identity; sexual orientation; pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation, including related medical conditions or recovery; and parental, marital, and family status. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 USC 12101-12213) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 794) prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. For policy language protecting students against discrimination and harassment, see BP/AR 5145.3 - Nondiscrimination/Harassment and BP/AR 5145.7 - Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment, and for language regarding Title IX complaint procedures, see AR 5145.71 - Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures.<br><br>Education Code 260 and 5 CCR 4900-4965 require the Board to monitor district compliance with these state and federal laws. The federal laws are enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE), and the California Department of Education (CDE) may investigate complaints regarding discrimination pursuant to 5 CCR 4600-4670.<br><br>OCR's May 2024 Dear Colleague Letter, "Protecting Students from Discrimination, such as Harassment, Based on Race, Color, or National Origin, Including Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics," which expands and clarifies USDOE's 2023, "Guidance on Constitutionally Protected Prayer and Religious Expression in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools," provides that Title VI's protections from race, color, and national origin discrimination extends to students who experience discrimination based on actual or perceived (1) shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, or (2) citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct religious identity. While Title VI does not protect individuals based solely on religious discrimination, it does apply to antisemitism and other forms of discrimination when based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. The guidance includes clarifying examples regarding existing legal requirements under Title VI.<br><br>Additionally, OCR's November 2023 Dear Colleague Letter, "Discrimination, Including Harassment, Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics," states that all students, including students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, or Palestinian, as well as students who come from, or are perceived to come from, all regions of the world, are entitled to a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. The Dear Colleague Letter provides that Title VI also protects students from discrimination which is based on (1) actual or perceived citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct religious identity, including Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist students, when the discrimination involves racial, ethnic, or ancestral slurs or stereotypes, (2) a student's skin color, physical features, or style of dress that reflects both ethnic and religious traditions, and (3) where a student came from or is perceived to have come from. Discrimination based on a student's foreign accent, foreign name, or a student speaking a foreign language may also violate Title VI's prohibitions against discrimination.<br><br>OCR's August 2023 Dear Colleague Letter, "Race and School Programming," states that a district may not separate students based on race, but may include group discussions or activities that focus on race as part of the curriculum, courses, or programs so long as access or participation is not permitted or limited based on race. OCR's guidance also provides that a school-sponsored program with emphasis on race, such as a student club, that is open to all students, typically would not violate Title VI solely because of its race-related theme.<br><br>Additionally, OCR's May 2023 Dear Colleague Letter, "Resource on Confronting Racial Discrimination in Student Discipline," published in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), states that a district's responsibility not to discriminate against students applies to any of its programs or activities, whether directly or through contractual or other arrangements.<br><br>In addition to the prohibitions to discrimination described above, Government Code 12940 provides protections for employees, job applicants, unpaid interns, and volunteers against unlawful discrimination and harassment on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, national origin, age, religious creed, marital status, reproductive health decisionmaking, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, veteran or military status, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or gender expression.<br><br>For policy language regarding Title IX complaint procedures for employees, see AR 4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 -  Title IX Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment Complaint Procedures, for language addressing protections against discrimination as they relate to employees, unpaid interns, and job applicants, see BP 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment and BP 4119.11/4219.11/4319.11 - Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based

District programs, activities, and practices shall be free from unlawful discrimination, including discrimination against an individual or group based on race; color; ancestry; nationality; national origin; immigration status; ethnic group identification; ethnicity; age; religion; pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation, including related medical conditions and recovery; parental, family, or marital status; reproductive health decisionmaking; physical or mental disability; medical condition; sex; sex stereotypes; sex characteristics; sexual orientation; gender; gender identity; gender expression; veteran or military status; or genetic information; a perception of one or more of such characteristics; or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.<br>

<div id='IMg427' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.7 mandates that districts adopt policy consistent with the California Attorney General's model policy contained in the Office of the Attorney General's publication, "Promoting a Safe and Secure Learning Environment for All: Guidance and Model Policies to Assist California's K-12 Schools in Responding to Immigration Issues." That model policy includes statements regarding the equitable provision of services and a prohibition against the use of school resources or data for creating a registry based on specific characteristics. In addition, Government Code 8310.3 prohibits districts from disclosing information about immigration status or religion to federal government authorities for use in the compilation of a registry for immigration enforcement or otherwise assisting in the creation of such a registry.

<div id='yOA428' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Education Code 243, as added by AB 1078, clarifies when it is unlawful discrimination for the Board to (1) refuse to approve the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or resource in a school library, or (2) prohibit the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or resource in a school library. The Board may not refuse to approve such use on the basis that the material includes a study of the role and contributions of specified individuals or groups, unless the study of the role and contributions reflects adversely upon legally protected groups.

<div id='ENA430' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 221.5, a district is required to permit a student to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, and to use facilities consistent with the student's gender identity, regardless of the student's gender as listed on the student's educational records.<br><br>Additionally, Title IX, 34 CFR 106.31, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, provides that a district (1) may not exclude a student from participation in, deny a student the benefits of, or otherwise subject a student to discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity, (2) that in the limited circumstances in which different treatment or separation on the basis of sex is permitted, a district may not carry out such different treatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex by subjecting a student to more than de minimis harm, and (3) that preventing a student from participating in an education program or activity consistent with the student's gender identity would subject the student to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex. In commentary accompanying the Final Rule, USDOE clarifies that Title IX protects students from sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment, when they access sex-separate facilities. This protection applies with equal force to all students, including transgender and nonbinary students, requiring districts to provide access to sex-separate facilities, including bathrooms, in a manner that does not cause more than de minimis harm. USDOE intends to issue a separate final rule to address Title IX's application to sex-separate athletic teams which is governed by 34 CFR 106.41, rather than 34 CFR 106.31 as described above.

<div id='wOA431' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Complaints alleging discrimination based on a violation of Education Code 243, as added by AB 1078, or Education Code 244, as added by SB 153, related to the use or prohibited use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or resource in a school library, as described above, may be brought under the district's uniform complaint procedures (UCP) or may be filed directly with the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI). Complaints that are filed directly with the SPI are required to identify the basis for doing so, and present evidence that supports the basis for the direct filing. In such cases, the SPI may directly intervene without waiting for an investigation by the district. See BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.<br><br>Pursuant to 34 CFR 106.11 and 106.44, as amended by 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, a district with knowledge of alleged conduct, which occurs in a district program or activity on or after August 1, 2024, that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, is required to follow Title IX grievance procedures when investigating and resolving a complaint based on the alleged conduct. As such a complaint may also fall within the complaint process as specified in BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, for students, and AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment, for employees, it is unclear whether districts would additionally be required to follow the procedures specified in BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures or AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment, as applicable. Due to this uncertainty, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel prior to utilizing such a complaint process for this purpose.

For example, pursuant to 34 CFR 104.8 and 106.8, a district that receives federal aid is required to take "continuing steps" to notify students, parents/guardians, employees, employee organizations, and applicants for admission and employment that it does not discriminate on the basis of disability or sex in its education programs or activities. In addition, Education Code 221.61 requires districts to post specified information relating to Title IX on their websites.
