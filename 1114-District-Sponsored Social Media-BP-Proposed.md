## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the value of social media to share District information with families and the community and promote community involvement and collaboration in District decisions. The purpose of any official District social media account shall be to further the District's vision and mission, to support student learning and staff professional development, and to enhance communication and engagement with students, families, staff, and community members. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the content posted by the District on an official District social media account is accessible to individuals with disabilities.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop content guidelines and protocols for official District social media accounts to ensure public access, appropriate and responsible use, and compliance with law, board policy, and administrative regulation.

Guidelines for Content
 
Official District social media accounts shall be used only for their stated purposes and in a manner consistent with this policy and administrative regulation. This policy is not intended to create an open public forum or otherwise guarantee an individual's right to free speech on any of the official District social media accounts even if one or more features on the account that permit interaction with and between members of the public are enabled.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the limited purpose of official District social media accounts is clearly communicated to users. Each account shall contain a statement specifying the purposes of the account, that the account shall only be used for such purposes, and any other user expectations or conditions as specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.

Official District social media accounts may not contain content that is obscene, libelous, or so incites students as to create a clear and present danger of the commission of unlawful acts on school premises, violation of school rules, or substantial disruption of the school's orderly operation.

Staff or students who post prohibited content or otherwise engage with an official District social media account in a manner that violates board policies and administrative regulations shall be subject to discipline in accordance with such applicable policies and regulations.

Users of official District social media accounts, and anyone who posts, replies, or otherwise leaves a digital footprint on an official District social media account, should be aware of the public nature and accessibility of social media and that such information posted or left on an official District social media account may be considered a public record subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act.

Privacy

To the extent practicable, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the privacy rights of students, parents/guardians, staff, Board members, and other individuals are protected on official District social media accounts.

As it pertains to the posting of student photographs and the privacy of telephone numbers, home addresses, and email addresses, official District social media accounts shall operate in accordance with Board Policy 1113 - District and School Websites.

Social media and other online platforms shall not be used by District employees to transmit confidential information about students, employees, or District operations.
