## Policy Content

The Board of Education authorizes independent study as an optional alternative instructional strategy for students whose needs may be best met through study outside of the regular classroom setting. Independent study shall offer a means of individualizing the educational plan to serve students who desire a more challenging educational experience, whose health or other personal circumstances make classroom attendance difficult, who are unable to access course(s) due to scheduling problems, and/or who need to make up credits or fill gaps in their learning. As necessary to meet student needs, independent study may be offered for short- or long-term placements, on a full-time or part-time basis, and/or in conjunction with part- or full-time classroom study.

The Board shall hold a public hearing when considering the scope of its existing or prospective use of independent study as an instructional strategy, its purposes in authorizing independent study, and factors bearing specifically on the maximum realistic lengths of assignments and acceptable number of missed assignments for specific populations of students or adult education students.  (Education Code 51747; 5 CCR 11701)

The Superintendent or designee may provide a variety of independent study opportunities, including, but not limited to, through a program or class within a comprehensive school, a charter school, an alternative school or program of choice, and/or an online course.

Student participation in independent study shall be voluntary and no student shall be required to participate.  (Education Code 51747, 51749.5, 51749.6)

Independent study for each student shall be under the general supervision of a District employee who possesses a valid certification document pursuant to Education Code 44865 or an emergency credential pursuant to Education Code 44300. Students' independent study shall be coordinated, evaluated, and documented, as prescribed by law and reflected in the accompanying administrative regulation.  (Education Code 51747.5)

An independent study student shall not be credited with more than one day of attendance per calendar day.  (Education Code 46300)

A nutritionally adequate breakfast and lunch shall be made available at no cost to any independent study student scheduled for educational activities lasting two or more hours at a school site, resource center, meeting space, or other satellite facility, who requests a meal.  (Education Code 49501.5)

General Independent Study Requirements

The Superintendent or designee may offer and approve independent study for an individual student upon determining that the student is prepared to meet the District's requirements for participation and is likely to succeed as well as or better than the student would in the regular classroom setting.

The minimum instructional minutes shall be the same for all students at each school including students participating in independent study, except as otherwise permitted by law.  (Education Code 46100)

Because excessive leniency in the duration of independent study assignments may result in a student falling behind peers and increase the risk of dropping out of school, independent study assignments shall be completed no more than one week after assigned for all grade levels and types of programs. When necessary, based on the specific circumstances of the student's approved program, the Superintendent or designee may allow for a longer period of time between the date an assignment is made and when it is due. However, in no event shall the due date of an assignment be extended beyond the termination date specified in the student's written agreement.

An evaluation shall be conducted to determine whether it is in a student's best interest to remain in independent study whenever the student fails to make satisfactory educational progress and/or misses three assignments. Satisfactory educational progress shall be determined based on all of the following indicators:  (Education Code 51747)

	The student's achievement and engagement in the independent study program, as indicated by the student's performance on applicable student-level measures of student achievement and engagement specified in Education Code 52060
	 
	The completion of assignments, assessments, or other indicators that evidence that the student is working on assignments
	 
	Learning of required concepts, as determined by the supervising teacher
	 
	Progress towards successful completion of the course of study or individual course, as determined by the supervising teacher

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that students participating in independent study are provided with content aligned to grade level standards at a level of quality and intellectual challenge substantially equivalent to in-person instruction. For high schools, this shall include access to all courses offered by the District for graduation and approved by the University of California (UC) or the California State University (CSU) as creditable under the A-G admissions criteria.  (Education Code 51747)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all students participating in independent study for 16 school days or more in a school year receive the following throughout the school year:  (Education Code 51747)

	For students in grades transitional kindergarten (TK)-3, opportunities for daily synchronous instruction
	 
	For students in grades 4-8, opportunities for both daily live interaction and at least weekly synchronous instruction
	 
	For students in grades 9-12, opportunities for at least weekly synchronous instruction

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that procedures for tiered reengagement strategies are used for all students participating in an independent study program for 16 school days or more in a school year who are:  (Education Code 51747)


	Not generating attendance for more than ten percent of required minimum instructional time over four continuous weeks of the District's approved instructional calendar
	 
	Not participating in synchronous instructional offerings pursuant to Education Code 51747.5 for more than 50 percent of the scheduled times of synchronous instruction in a school month as applicable by grade span
	 
	In violation of their written agreement

Tiered reengagement strategies procedures used in District independent study programs shall include local programs intended to address chronic absenteeism, as applicable, including but not limited to the following:  (Education Code 51747)

	Notification to parents/guardians of lack of participation within one school day of the recording of a nonattendance day or lack of participation
	 
	A plan for outreach from the school to determine student needs, including connection with health and social services as necessary
	 
	A clear standard for requiring a student-parent-educator conference to review a student's written agreement and reconsider the independent study program's impact on the student's achievement and well-being

The Superintendent or designee shall, for students who participate in an independent study program for 16 school days or more in a school year, develop a plan to transition students whose families wish to return to in-person instruction from independent study expeditiously, and, in no case, later than five instructional days.  (Education Code 51747)

When any student enrolled in classroom-based instruction is participating in independent study due to necessary medical treatment or inpatient treatment for mental health or substance abuse under the care of appropriately licensed professionals, the student shall be exempt from the live interaction and/or synchronous instruction, tiered reengagement strategies, and transition back to in-person instruction requirements specified above. In such cases, evidence from appropriately licensed professionals, of the student's need to participate in independent study, shall be submitted to the Superintendent or designee.  (Education Code 51747)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a written agreement exists for each participating student as prescribed by law.  (Education Code 51747, 51749.5)

Upon the request of the parent/guardian of a student, and before signing a written agreement as described below in "Master Agreement," below, the District shall conduct a telephone, videoconference, or in-person student-parent-educator conference or other meeting during which the student, parent/guardian, and, if requested by the parent/guardian an advocate, may ask questions about the educational options, including which curriculum offerings and nonacademic supports will be available to the student in independent study.  (Education Code 51747)

Master Agreement

A written agreement shall be developed and implemented for each student participating in independent study.  (Education Code 46300, 51747)

For student participation lasting 16 school days or more, a signed written agreement shall be obtained before the student begins independent study. For student participation of 15 school days or fewer, a signed written agreement may be obtained at any time during the school year in which the independent study program takes place.  (Education Code 46300, 51747)

The agreement shall include general student data, including the student's name, address, grade level, birth date, school of enrollment, and program placement.

The independent study agreement for each participating student also shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following:  (Education Code 51747; 5 CCR 11700, 11702)
