## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that all students have the right to be educated in a safe and positive learning environment free from disruptions. Students shall be expected to exhibit appropriate conduct that does not infringe upon the rights of others or interfere with the school program while on school grounds, going to or coming from school, at school activities, or using District transportation.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each school develops standards of conduct and discipline consistent with Board policies and administrative regulations. Students and parents/guardians shall be notified of District and school rules related to conduct.

Prohibited student conduct includes, but is not limited to:

	Conduct that endangers students, staff, or others, including, but not limited to, physical violence, possession of a firearm or other weapon, and terrorist threats
	 
	Discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying of students or staff, including sexual harassment, hate-motivated behavior, cyberbullying, hazing or initiation activity, extortion, or any other verbal, written, or physical conduct that causes or threatens to cause violence, bodily harm, or substantial disruption to the school program
	 
	Conduct that disrupts the orderly classroom or school environment
	 
	Willful defiance of staff's authority
	 
	Damage to or theft of property belonging to students, staff, or the District
	 
	Obscene acts or use of profane, vulgar, or abusive language
	 
	Possession, use, or being under the influence of tobacco, alcohol, or other prohibited substances
	 
	Possession or use of a laser pointer, unless for a valid instructional or other school-related purpose with prior permission of the principal or designee  (Penal Code 417.27)
	 
	Use of a smartphone or other mobile communication device in an unauthorized manner
	 
	Plagiarism or dishonesty on school work or tests
	 
	Wearing of any attire that violates District or school dress codes, including gang-related apparel
	 
	Tardiness or unexcused absence from school
	 
	Failure to remain on school premises in accordance with school rules
	 
	Other conduct prohibited by Education Code 48900-48915-48915

Employees are expected to enforce standards of conduct and when they observe or receive a report of a violation of these standards, to appropriately intervene, or seek assistance. As necessary, the employee shall refer the matter to a supervisor or the principal or designee.

When a school employee suspects that a search of a student or a student's belongings will turn up evidence of the student's violation of the law or school rules, such a search shall be conducted in accordance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 5145.12 - Search and Seizure.

When a student uses any prohibited device, or uses a permitted device in an unauthorized manner, a District employee may confiscate the device. The employee shall store the device securely until it is returned to the student or turned over to the principal or designee, as appropriate.

Students who violate District or school rules and regulations may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, suspension, expulsion, transfer to alternative programs, referral to a student success team or counseling services, or denial of participation in extracurricular or cocurricular activities or other privileges in accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation. The Superintendent or designee shall notify local law enforcement as appropriate.

Students also may be subject to discipline, in accordance with law, Board policy, or administrative regulation, for any off-campus conduct during nonschool hours which poses a threat or danger to the safety of students, staff, or District property, or substantially disrupts school activities.
