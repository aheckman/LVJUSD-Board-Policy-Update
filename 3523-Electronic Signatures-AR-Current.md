## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Government Code 16.5, public entities, including districts, are permitted to use digital signatures in their communications and operations.  A digital signature is a type of electronic signature, as defined in Civil Code 1633.1. Any such digital or electronic signature has the same force and effect as a manual signature, provided the signature is created using an acceptable technology and includes attributes specified in 2 CCR 22000-22005, as described below. In addition, Civil Code 1633.1-1633.17 (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act) and 15 USC 7001-7006 (Electronic Records and Signatures in Commerce Act) provide a framework for ensuring the validity of electronic contracts and security of electronic signatures in commerce and governmental transactions.In addition to the general authorization for use of electronic signatures as described above, an electronic signature may be used in specific instances. For example, an electronic signature may be used to fulfill the requirement for parental consent under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 USC 1400-1482). See comments to 71 Fed. Reg. 156 which provides that electronic signatures are permitted as long as the necessary steps are taken to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards to protect the integrity of the process. Also see the criteria for electronic signatures listed in Items #1-5 below and AR 6159.1 - Procedural Safeguards and Complaints for Special Education. Electronic signatures may also be used when families apply for child care and development services. See the California Department of Education's Management Bulletin 17-13.
When authorized by law, electronic signatures may be used in the operation of district business and/or administration.

In any business transaction, an electronic signature shall only be used when each party has agreed to conduct the transaction by electronic means. In other district operations, the Superintendent or designee may require the use of an electronic signature.  (Civil Code 1633.5; 15 USC 7001)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Civil Code 1633.2 and Government Code 16.5, a digital signature is a type of electronic signature. Aside from the definitions below, "electronic signature" will be used throughout this regulation to indicate all types of electronic signatures, including digital signatures.
A digital signature is defined as an electronic identifier, created by computer, intended by the party using it to have the same force and effect as the use of a manual signature. (Government Code 16.5)

An electronic signature consists of an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with an electronic record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the electronic record.  (Civil Code 1633.2)

In order for an electronic signature to be used, the electronic signature shall be:  (Government Code 16.5; 2 CCR 22002)

	Unique to the person using it
	 
	Capable of verification
	 
	Under the sole control of the person using it
	 
	Linked to data is such a manner that if the data are changed the electronic signature is invalidated
	 
	Conform to 2 CCR 22000-22005

Prior to accepting an electronic signature, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure the following:  (2 CCR 22005)


	That the signature is created by acceptable technology pursuant to 2 CCR 22003
	 
	That the level of security used to identify the signer of the document and to transmit the signature is sufficient for the transaction being conducted 
	 
	That, if a certificate is a required component of the electronic signature, the certificate format used by the signer is sufficient for the security and interoperability needs of the district.  

If a notarized signature is required with respect to an electronic signature, the electronic signature of the notary public together with all of the other information required by law to be included in a notarization shall accompany the electronic signature.  (Civil Code 1633.11)

If a statement is required to be signed under penalty of perjury, the electronic signature shall include all of the information to which the declaration pertains together with a declaration under penalty of perjury by the person who submits the electronic signature that the information is true and correct.  (Civil Code 1633.11)
