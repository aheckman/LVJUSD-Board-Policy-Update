## Policy Content

The Superintendent is the chief executive officer and educational leader of the District. He/she executes all Board of Education decisions and is accountable to the Board for managing the schools in accordance with federal and state laws and the Board's policies. He/she informs the Board about school programs, practices and problems and offers professional advice on items requiring Board action, with appropriate recommendations based on thorough study and analysis.

As the administrative and executive officer of the Board, the Superintendent is expected to execute all decisions approved by the Board. When action is required during a recess of the Board, the Superintendent will make decisions in keeping with Board policies.

The Board delegates to the Superintendent the power to make decisions concerning internal operations of the District.

He/she shall oversee all financial operations of the District and actively seek out new funding sources for all schools.

The Superintendent shall take an active leadership role in the development and improvement of the instructional program. He/she is expected to create a feeling of unity and enthusiasm among students and staff for the accomplishment of District goals.

The Superintendent shall articulate educational issues and values before the community and other governmental agencies. He/she shall be accessible to community members and shall work with them to further the District's goals and build a strong, positive community attitude toward the school system.

The Board expects the Superintendent to remain current on educational thought and practices by reading educational publications, attending educational conferences, and visiting other school systems in the interest of improving the District's instructional program and overall operation. The Superintendent shall inform the Board and staff of new developments and significant events in the field of education.

The Superintendent shall be familiar with current laws and legal cases that affect the District and provide this information to the Board and staff.

The Superintendent is expected to work for the fulfillment of District goals and objectives established by the Board. His/her responsibilities and duties shall be specified in contract and further detailed throughout the Board's policies.
