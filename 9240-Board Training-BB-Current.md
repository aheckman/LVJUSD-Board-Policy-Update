## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional bylaw may be revised to reflect district practice.CSBA's Professional Governance Standards include expectations that each Governing Board member will participate in professional development and commit the time and energy necessary to be an informed and effective leader. See CSBA's website for education opportunities, including, but not limited to, the Institute for New and First-Term Board Members, Masters in Governance Program, Annual Education Conference and Trade Show, Legal Symposium for Experienced Board Members, Board Presidents Workshop, Brown Act Workshop, Policy Update Webinars, and Ethics Trainings, as well as other workshops and webinars on specific topics, and in-district governance consulting services.
The Governing Board believes that the Board's ability to effectively and responsibly govern the district is essential to promoting student achievement, building positive community relations, and protecting the public interest in district schools. Board members shall participate in mandatory ethics training, as outlined below, and are encouraged to participate in ongoing opportunities for professional development sufficient to help them understand their responsibilities, stay abreast of new developments in education, and improve governance skills.

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 53234-53235.2 requires a Board member, except for a member whose term of office ends before January 1, 2026, to receive specified training in ethics by January 1, 2026, and at least once every two years thereafter, and for the district to maintain records of such training. Additionally, Government Code 53235, as amended by AB 2631 (Ch. 201, Statutes of 2024), requires the Fair Political Practices Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General, to create, maintain, and make an ethics training course available to local agency officials, including Board members.
Unless a Board member's term expires prior to January 1, 2026, each Board member shall complete ethics training in accordance with Government Code 53234-53235.2 by January 1, 2026, and at least once every two years thereafter.  (Government Code 53235)

Once completed, the Board member shall inform the Board president and Superintendent, who shall ensure that records are retained for each Board member's participation in the required ethics training.

The Board president and/or the Superintendent or designee shall provide an orientation to newly elected or appointed Board members consistent with Board Bylaw 9230 - Orientation.

The Board president shall work with the Superintendent or designee to include funds for professional development and associated reasonable travel expenses for the Board as a whole and for each individual Board member in the district's proposed annual budget.

Consistent with the availability of funds in the district's adopted annual budget, the Board president or designee shall annually develop, and bring to the Board for adoption at a Board meeting, a Board professional development calendar designed to assist the Board as a whole in understanding the principles of effective governance, including, but not limited to, information on school finance and budgets, student achievement and assessment, labor relations, community relations, program evaluation, open meeting laws (the Brown Act), conflict of interest laws, and other topics necessary to govern effectively and in compliance with law.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph permits individual Board members to identify and participate in additional professional development opportunities, with the only condition that there are funds available in the district's adopted annual budget for such purpose. It may be revised to reflect district practice.
Consistent with the availability of funds in the district's adopted annual budget, individual Board members may identify and participate in additional professional development opportunities, and shall timely inform the Board president and the Superintendent upon doing so. Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall establish timelines and procedures for how an individual Board member shall request that the district pay for such professional development opportunities, whether in advance or by reimbursement.

Board members are encouraged to consider participating in the professional development opportunities offered by CSBA such as the Institute for New and First-Term Board Members, Masters in Governance Program, Annual Education Conference and Trade Show, Legal Symposium for Experienced Board Members, Board Presidents Workshop, Brown Act Workshop, Policy Update Webinars, and Ethics Trainings.

Individual Board members are encouraged to share the knowledge or skills acquired from individual professional development opportunities with the full Board, thereby benefiting the Board and district.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54952.2, a "meeting" subject to Brown Act requirements does not include the attendance of a majority of the Board's members at a conference or similar public gathering, provided that a majority of the members do not discuss among themselves business of a specific nature that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board. Also see BB 9320 - Meetings and Notices.
Consistent with Board Bylaw 9320 - Meetings And Notices, Board members may attend a professional development opportunity as part of a conference or similar public gathering, such as the Annual Education Conference and Trade Show hosted by CSBA, so long as a majority of the Board members do not discuss among themselves, other than as part of the scheduled program, business of a specified nature that is within the district's jurisdiction
