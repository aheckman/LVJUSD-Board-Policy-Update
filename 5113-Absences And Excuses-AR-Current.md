These regulations should include all of Item #14 below and may be expanded to reflect district practice.The student must also attend school for at least the minimum school day and not be absent for this purpose on more than four days per school month. Pursuant to Education Code 46112, 46113, 46117, and 46141, unless otherwise provided by law, the minimum school day is generally 180 minutes for kindergarten, 230 minutes for grades 1-3, and 240 minutes for grades 4-12.

Method of Verification

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48205 prohibits the district from requiring a physician's note for absences due to the illness or medical appointment of the student's child. However, the district is authorized to require verification of other absences. The following section should be revised to reflect district-adopted methods of verification and to specify employee(s) assigned to verify absences.5 CCR 420-421 provide guidelines for verifying absences due to illness; quarantine; medical, dental, or eye appointments; or attendance at a funeral service of a member of a student's immediate family. 5 CCR 421 authorizes a student's absence to be verified by a school or public health nurse, attendance supervisor, physician, principal, teacher, or any other qualified district employee assigned to make such verification.
Student absence to care for a child for whom the student is the custodial parent shall not require a physician's note.  (Education Code 48205)

For other absences, the student shall, upon returning to school following the absence, present a satisfactory explanation, either in person or by written note, verifying the reason for the absence. Absences shall be verified by the student's parent/guardian, other person having charge or control of the student, or the student if age 18 or older.  (Education Code 46012; 5 CCR 306)

When an absence is planned, the principal or designee shall be notified prior to the date of the absence when possible.

The following methods may be used to verify student absences:

	Written, digital, or audio message from parent/guardian or parent representative
	 
	Conversation, in person or by telephone, between the verifying employee and the student's parent/guardian or parent representative
	
	The employee shall subsequently record the following:
	 
	
		Name of student
		 
		Name of parent/guardian or parent representative
		 
		Name of verifying employee
		 
		Date(s) of absence
		 
		Reason for absence
		 
	
	
	Visit to the student's home by the verifying employee, or any other reasonable method which establishes the fact that the student was absent for the reasons stated
	
	The employee shall document the verification and include the information specified in Item #2 above.
	 
	Physician's verification
	
	CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph provides a means of verifying an excuse for confidential medical services without inquiring into the nature of the medical services.
	
		When excusing students for confidential medical services or verifying such appointments, district staff shall not ask the purpose of such appointments but may request a note from the medical office to confirm the time of the appointment
		
		CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph provides that, after absences for illness on multiple occasions, the student may be required to bring a note from a physician to verify the illness. If a student does not have access to medical services in order to obtain such verification, the district may assist the student in obtaining the medical consultation if it is required.
		If a student shows a pattern of chronic absenteeism due to illness, district staff may require physician verification of any further student absences
	
	

Parental Notifications

At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall:

CSBA NOTE: The requirement in Item #1 below is for use by any district whose board has adopted a resolution permitting an excused absence for religious instruction or exercises. See the accompanying Board policy and Item #14 in the section "Excused Absences" above.


	Notify parents/guardians of the right to excuse a student from school in order to participate in religious exercises or to receive moral and religious instruction at their places of worship, or at other suitable places away from school property designated by a religious group, church, or denomination  (Education Code 46014, 48980)
	
	CSBA NOTE: The requirement in Item #2 applies to all districts. Districts that maintain only elementary grades should delete the reference to students in grades 7-12.
	Notify students in grades 7-12 and the parents/guardians of all students enrolled in the district that school authorities may excuse any student from school to obtain confidential medical services without the consent of the student's parent/guardian  (Education Code 46010.1)
	 
	Notify parents/guardians that a student shall not have a grade reduced or lose academic credit for any excused absence if missed assignments and tests that can reasonably be provided are satisfactorily completed within a reasonable period of time  (Education Code 48980)
	
	Such notice shall include the full text of Education Code 48205.  (Education Code 48980)
