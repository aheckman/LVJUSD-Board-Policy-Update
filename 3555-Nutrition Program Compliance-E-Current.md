NONDISCRIMINATION STATEMENT FOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS

CSBA NOTE: As part of its instructions to all recipients of federal funds for child nutrition programs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) requires that all forms of communication available to the public regarding program availability also contain information about that recipient's status as an equal opportunity provider and the address of the agency with responsibility to handle complaints made against the recipient. The following exhibit presents specific language provided by USDA for the notification, which must not be modified in any way.
The following statement shall be included, in a prominent location, on all forms available to the public regarding the availability of the district's child nutrition programs:
 

"In accordance with Federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) civil rights regulations and policies, this institution is prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), disability, age, or reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity.

Program information may be made available in languages other than English. Persons with disabilities who require alternative means of communication to obtain program information (e.g., Braille, large print, audiotape, American Sign Language, etc.), should contact the responsible state or local agency that administers the program or USDA's TARGET Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice and TTY) or contact USDA through the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339.

To file a program discrimination complaint, a Complainant should complete a Form AD-3027, USDA Program Discrimination Complaint Form, which can be obtained online at: https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ad-3027.pdf, from any USDA office, by calling (866) 632-9992, or by writing a letter addressed to the USDA. The letter must contain the complainant's name, address, telephone number, and a written description of the alleged discriminatory action in sufficient detail to inform the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (ASCR) about the nature and date of an alleged civil rights violation. The completed AD-3027 form or letter must be submitted to USDA by:

(1)    mail:  U.S. Department of Agriculture
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights
1400 Independence Avenue, SW
Washington, D.C. 20250-9410; or

(2)    fax:  (833) 256-1665 or (202) 690-7442; or

(3)    email:  Program.Intake@usda.gov

This institution is an equal opportunity provider."


On pamphlets, brochures, and flyers, in the same print size as the rest of the text, the district may print a short version of the nondiscrimination statement, as follows:
 

"This institution is an equal opportunity provider."
