## Policy Content

The Board of Education shall establish school attendance boundaries in order to maximize the efficient use of District facilities and effective administration of District schools. The Superintendent or designee shall periodically review school attendance boundaries and, as necessary, make recommendations to the Board for boundary adjustments.

When reviewing school attendance boundaries, the Superintendent or designee shall consider the following factors:


	School enrollment data, including declining enrollment patterns
	 
	Facility capacity and design, including potential commercial and residential developments
	 
	School feeder patterns, including maintaining, to the extent practicable, continuity of student attendance
	 
	Federal, state, or court mandates
	 
	Community input
	 
	Student safety
	 
	Transportation capacity
	 
	Community and neighborhood identity
	 
	Geographic features of the District, including traffic patterns
	 
	Educational programs, such as magnet schools and charter schools
	 
	Consistency between municipal boundaries and high school boundaries
	 
	Other factors


Students residing in a community facilities district shall have priority, to the extent provided by law, for attendance at schools financed in whole or in part by the community facilities district. The degree of priority must reflect the proportion of each school's financing provided through the community facilities district. (Government Code 53312.7)

In order to alleviate overcrowding, the Superintendent or designee may place some students in a school outside of their attendance area. Parents/guardians of students who are attending schools outside of their attendance area shall be notified of the school their child will be attending as soon as possible.
