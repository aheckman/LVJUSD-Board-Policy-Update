## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Government Code 12949, several court cases, and Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) decisions support districts' non-negotiable management prerogative to adopt a dress code.  However, in 22 PERC P29, 136, PERB determined that districts must provide the exclusive bargaining representative with an opportunity to bargain over the "effects" of the dress code which may have an impact on matters within scope of representation.  Districts should consult legal counsel when prescribing or prohibiting specific items of clothing.
The Governing Board believes that appropriate dress and grooming by district employees contribute to a productive learning environment and model positive behavior. During school hours and at school activities, employees shall maintain professional standards of dress and grooming that demonstrate their high regard for education, present an image consistent with their job responsibilities and assignment, and do not endanger the health or safety of employees or students. All employees shall be held to the same standards unless their assignment provides for modified dress as approved by their supervisor.

The district shall allow employees to appear and dress in a manner consistent with their gender identity or gender expression.  (Government Code 12949)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 12926, as amended by SB 188 (Ch. 58, Statutes of 2019), defines "race," for purposes of prohibiting employment discrimination, as including traits historically associated with race, such as hair texture and protective hairstyles, as defined.
The district shall not discriminate against employees based on hair texture and protective hairstyles, including, but not limited to, braids, locks, and twists.  (Government Code 12926)

The district shall not dismiss an employee, discriminate against an employee in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or refuse to hire a job applicant on the basis of religious dress or grooming practices.  (Government Code 12926, 12940)

This policy shall be presented to employees upon employment, through the employee handbook or other appropriate means, and may be periodically reviewed with all employees as necessary.
