## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy and accompanying administrative regulation reflect requirements of the California Public Records Act (CPRA) (Government Code 7920.000 - 7930.215) pertaining to public access to public records of the district. "Public records," as defined by Government Code 7920.530, include any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the district's business prepared, owned, used, or retained by the district regardless of physical form or characteristics; see "Definitions" in the accompanying administrative regulation. For information regarding retention of records, see BP/AR 3580 - District Records, AR 4112.6/4212.6/4312.6 - Personnel Files, and BP/AR 5125 - Student Records.Because the rules and regulations surrounding CPRA disclosures are complex, it is recommended that districts with questions about an appropriate response to a CPRA request consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
The Governing Board recognizes the right of members of the public to have access to public records of the district. The district shall provide any person reasonable access to the public records of the schools and district during normal business hours and within the requirements of law. Public access shall not be given to records listed as exempt from public disclosure in the California Public Records Act and other state or federal law.

CSBA NOTE: In City of San Jose v. Superior Court, the California Supreme Court held that communications regarding public business that have been sent, received, or stored by public officials on a personal account or device are not categorically exempt from disclosure under the CPRA. The court noted that public agencies are required to disclose all applicable records that can be located "with reasonable effort," including those records contained on a public official's or employee's personal device, regardless of whether they were transmitted through district servers. Such searches need not be extraordinarily extensive or intrusive. For further information, see CSBA's, "Legal Alert: Tips for Governing Boards in Response to Public Records Act Ruling on Electronic Communications." Also see AR 3580 - District Records, BP 4040 - Employee Use of Technology, and BB 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications.
In response to a public records request, the Superintendent or designee shall make reasonable efforts to locate the requested records, including, but not limited to, any electronic communication substantively related to the records, such as email, text messages, instant messages, and other electronic communications, regardless of whether they are transmitted through a district-provided device or account or through an employee's or Board member's personal device or account.

The district may charge for copies of public records or other materials requested by individuals or groups, in accordance with law and as specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional.
In order to help maintain the security of district records, members of the public granted access shall examine records in the presence of a district staff member.
