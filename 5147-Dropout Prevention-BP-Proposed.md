## Policy Content

The Board of Education expects all students to remain in school until graduation in order to acquire critical knowledge and skills and be prepared for postsecondary education and/or employment. The Superintendent or designee shall identify factors that impede student success in school and shall implement integrated, systemic support and strategies that address dropout prevention and promote timely intervention and recovery.

The Superintendent or designee, in collaboration with parents/guardians, school staff, and community agencies and organizations as appropriate, shall develop Districtwide and schoolwide strategies that support regular school attendance for all students. Dropout prevention strategies shall include efforts to provide a safe and positive learning environment that engages and motivates students, encourages students' connectedness to the schools, offers meaningful educational opportunities, and promotes student health and well-being.

In order to make up lost instructional time and offset absences, the District may implement attendance recovery programs. Any attendance recovery program shall be provided as a voluntary, limited-term option for a classroom-based, regular education program for students in grades TK-12 in accordance with Education Code 46211.

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies to provide targeted support to individual students who are at risk of dropping out of school. Students may be identified based on indicators such as chronic absenteeism, truancy, or tardiness; below-grade-level academic achievement as evidenced by student assessment results and/or teacher evaluations; and personal, social, health, or economic circumstances that may affect student performance and behavior in school.

Strategies to support students at risk of dropping out of school may include, but are not limited to:

	Meetings and/or home visits with the student and parent/guardian to identify and address barriers to the student's success and inform them of the state's compulsory education law
	 
	Individualized instruction that responds to the needs and unique learning styles of students
	 
	Supplemental instruction during or outside the school day that is designed to help students overcome academic deficiencies, including attendance recovery programs
	 
	Enrollment in alternative or specialized educational programs
	 
	Assistance locating employment or work-based learning opportunities which link classroom learning with real-world experiences
	 
	Academic guidance and personal counseling services
	 
	Referral to a student success team, school attendance review board, or other team that addresses persistent attendance problems
	 
	Referral to school and/or community support services, such as a student assistance program; substance abuse program; health services or school nurse; school social worker or social services; school counselor, school psychologist or other student support personnel for case management and counseling; and other resources
	 
	Continued monitoring of student attendance, including tracking student attendance and identifying students with attendance problems as early as possible, so the school may provide appropriate support services and interventions
	 
	Employment of qualified outreach consultants to perform duties related to dropout identification, prevention, intervention, and recovery as assigned
	 
	Creating small, personalized learning communities to facilitate monitoring and support
	 
	Offering courses or programs that connect schoolwork with college and career success, including career technical education

The strategies may be incorporated into the District's local control and accountability plan and linked to District goals for student engagement, school climate, and student achievement.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that employees are trained to support at-risk students and are prepared to implement intervention strategies or to make appropriate referrals to support services.

When a student leaves school prior to the end of a school year, or when a student successfully completed the prior school year but did not begin attending the next grade or school that the student was expected to attend or had pre-registered to attend, the Superintendent or designee shall make efforts to determine whether the student has dropped out or has transferred to another educational setting. The Superintendent or designee may contact the student's parents/guardians to verify school enrollment and, if necessary, shall implement intervention and recovery efforts.

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain required documentation for students who transfer from or otherwise withdraw from a school in the District.  (20 USC 6311)

The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board on measures of student engagement, including school attendance rates, chronic absenteeism rates, middle school and high school dropout rates, and high school graduation rates. The Board shall monitor District progress in increasing student retention in school and may require revisions in District plans and strategies as needed.
