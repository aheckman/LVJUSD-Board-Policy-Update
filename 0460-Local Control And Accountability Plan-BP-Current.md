## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE:  Education Code 52060-52077 require the Governing Board to adopt, on or before July 1, a local control and accountability plan (LCAP), an annual update to the LCAP, and a local control funding formula (LCFF) budget overview for parents/guardians. Pursuant to Education Code 52060, the LCAP must include goals and actions aligned with eight state priorities related to (1) the degree to which teachers are appropriately assigned and fully credentialed, students have sufficient access to standards-based instructional materials, and facilities are maintained in good repair, (2) implementation of and student access to state academic content and performance standards, (3) parent/guardian involvement and family engagement, (4) student achievement, (5) student engagement, (6) school climate, (7) student access to and enrollment in a broad course of study, including programs and services provided to benefit low-income students, English learners, and/or foster youth (i.e., "unduplicated students" for purposes of supplemental and concentration grants under the LCFF), and (8) student outcomes in the specified course of study. Education Code 52060 provides that, in addition to addressing the state priorities in the LCAP, the district may establish and address local priorities and goals. See the accompanying administrative regulation for further information about the required content of the LCAP.
The Governing Board desires to ensure the most effective use of available funding to improve outcomes for all students. A comprehensive, data-driven planning process shall be used to identify annual goals and specific actions which are aligned with the district budget and facilitate continuous improvement of district practices.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52064, the State Board of Education (SBE) has adopted a template that districts must use to complete the LCAP and the annual update, which, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), provides for numerous changes which are required to be adopted by SBE for use in the 2024-25 school year. Additionally, Education Code 52064.4, as added by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), requires, for the period July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2028, all Learning Recovery Emergency Funds received to be included, as specified, in the LCAP or annual update. This requirement will be reflected in the template and instructions that accompany the template adopted by SBE at its November 2024 meeting. Districts should ensure that they are using the most up-to-date template, an electronic version of which is available on the California Department of Education's (CDE) website.
The Board shall adopt a districtwide local control and accountability plan (LCAP) and an annual update to the LCAP, based on the most up-to-date template adopted by the State Board of Education (SBE), that addresses the state priorities in Education Code 52060 and any local priorities adopted by the Board. The LCAP and the annual update shall be adopted or updated, as required, on or before July 1 of each year.  (Education Code 52060, 52064; 5 CCR 15494-15497)

The LCAP and the annual update shall focus on improving outcomes for all students, particularly those who are "unduplicated students" or are part of any numerically significant student subgroup that is at risk of or is underperforming.  (Education Code 52060, 52064)

An "unduplicated student" is a student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals, who is an English learner, or who is a foster youth, as defined in Education Code 42238.01.  (Education Code 42238.02)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 114, has been expanded to include long-term English learners as a numerically significant subgroup, separate from English learners. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), a "long-term English learner" is defined as a student who has not attained English language proficiency within seven years of initial classification as an English learner.
Numerically significant student subgroups include ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, long-term English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and students experiencing homelessness, when there are at least 30 students in the subgroup or at least 15 foster youth, students experiencing homelessness, or long-term English learners.  (Education Code 52052)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that receive LCFF equity multiplier funding. Pursuant to Education Code 42238.024 and 52064, as added and amended by SB 114, districts that receive LCFF equity multiplier funding are required to include specific goals in the LCAP for each school generating such funding. Pursuant to Education Code 42238.024, as amended by SB 153, if a school which is otherwise eligible to receive LCFF equity multiplier funds is closed in the year in which the funds are to be allocated, that school is instead deemed to be ineligible, and any unspent funds provided are required to be returned to CDE.
The LCAP shall also include focused goals, as specified in Education Code 52064, for each school generating local control funding formula (LCFF) equity multiplier funds.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52064.3, as amended by SB 153, the date upon which an Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Addendum is required to be completed by districts that are identified by CDE as needing an improvement plan pursuant to 34 CFR 300.600-300.647 has been extended to July 1, 2027. Such identified districts must comply with the requirements specified in the following paragraph.
Beginning July 1, 2027, if the district is identified by the California Department of Education (CDE) as needing an improvement plan pursuant to 34 CFR 300.600-300.647, the Board shall adopt, and update on an annual basis, an Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Addendum, based on the template adopted by SBE. However, if the district adopts an improvement plan after being identified, but before July 1, 2027, the IDEA Addendum shall be developed upon expiration of the adopted improvement plan, but no later than July 1, 2030, whichever occurs first. The IDEA Addendum shall be developed, reviewed, and approved in conjunction with and in the same manner as the LCAP and the annual update, and shall be submitted to CDE within 15 days of adoption by the Board.  (Education Code 52064.3)

The Superintendent or designee shall review the school plan for student achievement (SPSA) submitted by each district school pursuant to Education Code 64001 to ensure that the specific actions included in the LCAP are consistent with strategies included in the SPSA.  (Education Code 52062)

CSBA NOTE: Except for the IDEA Addendum, the LCFF budget overview for parents/guardians, and the school plan for student achievement, districts are not required to align the LCAP with any other district strategic documents, such as the District Strategic Plan, English Learner Master Plan, or Facilities Master Plan. However, districts are encouraged to align their LCAPs with other district strategic documents to ensure consistent implementation.
The LCAP shall also be aligned with other district and school plans, to the extent possible, in order to minimize duplication of effort and provide clear direction for program implementation.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52064.1, districts are required to develop an LCFF budget overview for parents/guardians in conjunction with, and attached as a cover to, the LCAP and the annual update. The budget overview is subject to the requirements of Education Code 52062 and 52070 pertaining to the adoption, review, and approval of the LCAP and the annual update.
As part of the adoption of the LCAP and the annual update, the Board shall separately adopt a LCFF budget overview for parents/guardians, based on the template developed by SBE, which includes specified information relating to the district's budget. The budget overview shall be adopted, reviewed, and approved in the same manner as the LCAP and the annual update.  (Education Code 52064.1)

Advisory Committees

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52063 and 5 CCR 15495, the Board is required to establish a parent advisory committee and, if district enrollment includes at least 15 percent English learners, an English learner parent advisory committee to review and comment on the LCAP and the annual update. The district may use existing parent advisory committees for these purposes if the committee composition complies with Education Code 52063 and 5 CCR 15945. However, the district should consider whether such opportunities need to be expanded to achieve significant levels of involvement in the planning process as intended by law.Education Code 52063 requires the LCAP parent advisory committee to include parents/guardians of currently enrolled students with disabilities.
The Board shall establish a parent advisory committee, which shall be composed of a majority of parents/guardians and shall include parents/guardians of unduplicated students and parents/guardians of students with disabilities.  (Education Code 52063; 5 CCR 15495)

Whenever district enrollment includes at least 15 percent English learners, with at least 50 students who are English learners, the Board shall establish an English Learner Parent Advisory Committee, which shall be composed of a majority of parents/guardians of English learners.  (Education Code 52063; 5 CCR 15495)

The District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) may serve as the district's LCAP English Learner Parent Advisory Committee, as specified in Administrative Regulation 6174 - Education for English Learners.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for districts serving middle and/or high school students. Education Code 52063requires districts serving middle or high school students to include two students as full members of the existing parent advisory committee or establish a student advisory committee to provide advice to the Board and the Superintendent or designee. Student members of the parent advisory committee or the student advisory committee shall represent the diversity of the district's students, as described below. Districts that do not serve middle or high school students may delete the following paragraphs relating to student advisory members.
Unless a student advisory committee is established to provide advice to the Board and Superintendent, two students shall be included as full members of the parent advisory committee. The students shall serve for a renewable term of one full school year.  (Education Code 52063)

Student members of the parent advisory committee or the student advisory committee shall represent the diversity of the district's students, including geographical, socioeconomic, cultural, physical, and educational diversity, and particular effort shall be made to reach out to at-risk or disadvantaged students to serve as members of such committees.  (Education Code 52063)

The Superintendent or designee shall present the LCAP and the annual update to each of these committee(s) before they are submitted to the Board for adoption, and shall respond in writing to comments received from the committee(s).

LCAP Development and Consultation

The Superintendent or designee shall gather data and information needed for effective and meaningful development of the LCAP and present it to the Board and community. Such data and information shall include, but not be limited to, data regarding the number of students in student subgroups, disaggregated data on student achievement levels, and information about current programs and expenditures.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060 requires consultation on LCAP development with all of the groups listed below. The Board may delegate responsibility for arranging meetings and other input opportunities to the Superintendent or designee.5 CCR 15495 defines what it means to consult with students, including unduplicated students and other numerically significant student subgroups, and gives examples of methods that may be used for this consultation. State regulations do not provide examples of consultation with groups other than students, but consultations might include surveys, the use of existing advisory committees, solicitation of feedback from the groups after drafts of the LCAP and annual update are available, discussion of the LCAP and the annual update at staff meetings, and communication with parent organizations, student councils, school site councils, or other established committees or organizations. The district may expand the list with whom the district seeks consultation.
The Board shall consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, employee bargaining units, parents/guardians, and students in developing the LCAP and the annual update. Consultation with students shall enable unduplicated students and other numerically significant student subgroups to review and comment on LCAP development and may include surveys of students, student forums and committees, and/or meetings with student government bodies or other groups representing students.  (Education Code 52060; 5 CCR 15495)

CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to Education Code 305, the LCAP parent/guardian and community engagement process must include solicitation of input on language acquisition programs. See BP/AR 6174 - Education for English Learners for further information regarding the types of language acquisition programs that may be offered.
As part of the parent/guardian and community engagement process, the district shall solicit input on effective and appropriate instructional methods, including, but not limited to, establishing language acquisition programs to enable all students, including English learners and native English speakers, to have access to the core academic content standards and to become proficient in English.  (Education Code 305-306)

The Superintendent or designee shall consult with the administrator(s) of the special education local plan area of which the district is a member to ensure that specific actions for students with disabilities are included in the LCAP and are consistent with strategies included in the annual assurances support plan for the education of students with disabilities.  (Education Code 52062)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52062 requires notification to the public of the opportunity to submit written comments on the proposed LCAP and the annual update, including notification in the primary language of parents/guardians when required by Education Code 48985. Pursuant to Education Code 48985, whenever 15 percent or more of the students in a school speak a single primary language other than English, notifications sent to parents/guardians of such students must be written in the primary language as well as in English; see BP 5145.6 - Parental Notifications.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify members of the public of the opportunity to submit written comments regarding the specific actions and expenditures proposed to be included in the LCAP and the annual update. The notification shall be provided using the most efficient method of notification possible, which may not necessarily include producing printed notices or sending notices by mail. All written notifications related to the LCAP and the annual update shall be provided in the primary language of parents/guardians when required by Education Code 48985.  (Education Code 52062)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 42127, the Board must not adopt a district budget until the LCAP is in place for the budget year; see BP 3100 - Budget. The budget must include the expenditures necessary to implement the plan that will be effective during the subsequent fiscal year. If it does not, the County Superintendent of Schools will disapprove the district's budget.
The Board shall hold at least one public hearing to solicit the recommendations and comments of members of the public regarding the specific actions and expenditures proposed to be included in the LCAP and the annual update. The public hearing shall be held at the same meeting as the budget hearing required pursuant to Education Code 42127 and Board Policy 3100 - Budget.  (Education Code 52062)

Adoption and Submission

The Board shall adopt the LCAP and the annual update prior to adopting the district budget, but at the same public meeting. This meeting shall be held after the public hearing described above, but not on the same day as the hearing.  (Education Code 52062)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52070 requires the district to submit the LCAP and the annual update to the County Superintendent, who may seek written clarification of the contents and may submit recommendations for amendments as provided below. The County Superintendent is required to approve the LCAP and the annual update on or before October 8 if it is determined that (1) the LCAP and the annual update adhere to the template adopted by SBE and follows any SBE instructions or directions for completing the template, (2) the district budget includes expenditures sufficient to implement the specific actions and strategies in the LCAP, and (3) the LCAP adheres to supplemental and concentration grant expenditure requirements specified in Education Code 42238.07 for unduplicated students. In determining whether the district has fully demonstrated that it will use supplemental and concentration funds to increase or improve services for unduplicated students, 5 CCR 15497 requires the County Superintendent to review any descriptions of districtwide or schoolwide services provided.
Not later than five days after adoption of the LCAP, the annual update, the district budget, and the budget overview for parents/guardians, the Board shall file the LCAP, the annual update, the budget, and the budget overview with the County Superintendent of Schools.  (Education Code 42127, 52064.1, 52070)

If the County Superintendent sends, by August 15, a written request for clarification of the contents of the LCAP and the annual update, the Board shall respond in writing within 15 days of the request. If the County Superintendent then submits recommendations for amendments within 15 days of receiving the Board's response, the Board shall consider those recommendations in a public meeting within 15 days of receiving the recommendations.  (Education Code 52070)

If the County Superintendent does not approve the district's LCAP and the annual update, the Board shall accept technical assistance from the County Superintendent focused on revising the LCAP and the annual update so that they can be approved.  (Education Code 52071)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52064.5, as amended by SB 153, if the Board is unable to review local indicator data (data adopted by SBE to measure district and school site performance in regard to specified state priorities), due to any emergency specified in Education Code 46392, the Board is required to review such data at its next Board meeting, adopt a resolution describing the emergency event and the date on which the local indicator data was reviewed, and submit the resolution to CDE.
If the Board is unable to review local indicator data due to any emergency specified in Education Code 46392, the local indicator data shall be reviewed at the next Board meeting, and a resolution describing the emergency event and the date on which the local indicator data was reviewed shall be adopted and submitted to CDE.  (Education Code 52064.5)

Revisions
