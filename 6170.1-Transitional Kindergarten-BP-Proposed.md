## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to offer a high-quality transitional kindergarten (TK) program for eligible children who do not yet meet the minimum age criterion for kindergarten. The TK program shall assist students in developing the academic, social, and emotional skills needed to succeed in kindergarten and beyond.

The District's TK program shall be the first year of a two-year kindergarten program.  (Education Code 48000)

The Board encourages ongoing collaboration among District preschool staff, other preschool providers, elementary teachers, administrators, and parents/guardians in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the District's TK program.

Eligibility

The District's TK program shall admit children as follows:  (Education Code 48000)

	For the 2025-26 school year, and in each school year thereafter, children who turn four by September 1

A child's eligibility for TK enrollment shall not impact family eligibility for a preschool or child care program, including, but not limited to, a Head Start program, a child care center serving children through an alternative payment program, a general child care and development program, a California State Preschool Program (CSPP), a migrant child care and development program, child care and development services for children with special needs, or a program serving children through a CalWORKs Stage 1, Stage 2, or Stage 3 program.  (Education Code 48000)

Parents/guardians of eligible children shall be notified of the availability of the TK program and of the age, residency, immunization, and any other enrollment requirements. Enrollment in the TK program shall be voluntary.

On a case-by-case basis, a child whose fifth birthday is on or before September 1 may be admitted into the District's TK program upon request of a child's parents/guardians, if the Superintendent or designee, determines that it is in the child's best interest.

Curriculum and Instruction

The District's TK program shall be age and developmentally appropriate.  (Education Code 48000)

The program shall be aligned with the preschool learning foundations and preschool curriculum frameworks developed by the California Department of Education (CDE). It shall be designed to facilitate students' social-emotional development, and essential knowledge and skills related to language and literacy, mathematics, physical development, health, and English language development.

Students in TK are not required to be assessed in English listening and speaking for purposes of initial identification as an English learner. However the District shall conduct the Home Language Survey during enrollment to identify whether the primary or native language of a student is other than English.

The Board shall establish the length of the school day in the District's TK program, which shall be at least three hours but no more than four hours long, including recess but excluding noon intermission, except for TK students enrolled in expanded learning opportunity programs provided by the District pursuant to Education Code 46120. If the District has adopted an extended-day kindergarten, the length of the school day for the TK program may be different than the length of the school day for the kindergarten program either at the same or different school sites. The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to CDE as to whether the District's TK programs are offered full-day, part-day, or both.  (Education Code 8973, 37202, 46111, 46115, 46117, 48003)

The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with parents/guardians and relevant community groups, in accordance with the plan developed for how all children in the attendance area of the District will have access to full-day learning programs the year before kindergarten that meet the needs of parents/guardians, including through partnerships with the District's expanded learning opportunities, the After School Education and Safety Program, CSPP, Head Start programs, and other community-based early learning and care programs.

TK students may be placed in the same classrooms as kindergarten students when necessary, provided that the instructional program is differentiated to meet student needs. TK students may be commingled in the same classroom with four-year-old students from a CSPP program as long as the commingled program meets all of the requirements of each program as well as the following requirements:  (Education Code 8207, 48000)

	The classroom does not include students enrolled in TK for a second year or students enrolled in a regular kindergarten
	 
	An observation using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) tool and CLASS Environmental tool are completed for the classroom
	 
	All children enrolled for 10 or more hours per week are evaluated using the Desired Results Developmental Profile, as specified in 5 CCR 18272
	 
	The classroom is taught by a teacher that holds a credential issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) in accordance with Education Code 44065 and 44256
	 
	The classroom is in compliance with the adult-child ratio specified in Education Code 8241
	 
	Contractors of the District report the services, revenues, and expenditures for children in the preschool program in accordance with 5 CCR 18068 except for contractors of the TK program

The District shall maintain an average TK class enrollment of not more than 24 students for each school site, not including students who are continuously enrolled in and meet the minimum day requirement for independent study for more than 14 school days in a school year.  (Education Code 48000)

Staffing

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that teachers assigned to teach in TK classes possess a teaching credential or permit from CTC that authorizes such instruction.

A credentialed teacher who is first assigned to a TK class after July 1, 2015, shall, by August 1, 2025, have at least 24 units in early childhood education and/or child development, comparable professional experience in a preschool setting, and/or a child development teacher permit or an early childhood specialist credential issued by CTC.  (Education Code 48000)

The Superintendent or designee may provide professional development as needed to ensure that TK teachers are knowledgeable about the standards and effective instructional methods for teaching young children, including, but not limited to, developing competencies in serving inclusive classrooms and dual language learners.

The District shall maintain an average of at least one adult for every 12 students for TK classrooms and, contingent upon an appropriation of funding, maintain an average of at least one adult for every 10 students commencing with the 2025-26 school year.  (Education Code 48000)

Continuation to Kindergarten

Students who complete the TK program shall be eligible to continue in kindergarten the following school year. Parents/guardians of such students shall not be required to submit a signed Kindergarten Continuance Form for kindergarten attendance.

However, whenever children who would otherwise be age-eligible for kindergarten are enrolled in TK, the Superintendent or designee shall obtain a Kindergarten Continuance Form signed by the parent/guardian near the end of the TK year consenting to the child's enrollment in kindergarten the following year.

A student shall not attend more than two years in kindergarten or a combination of TK and kindergarten.  (Education Code 46300)

Assessment

The Superintendent or designee may develop or identify appropriate formal and/or informal assessments of TK students' development and progress. The Superintendent or designee shall monitor and regularly report to the Board regarding program implementation, the progress of students in meeting related academic standards, and student preparedness for future education.
