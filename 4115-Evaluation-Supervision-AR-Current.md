Evaluation of certificated employees shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures established in this administrative regulation and applicable collective bargaining agreements. To the extent that any of those provisions conflict, the procedures in the collective bargaining agreement shall be implemented.

The Superintendent or designee shall print and make available to certificated employees written regulations related to the evaluation of their performance in their assigned duties. (Education Code 35171)

Frequency of Evaluations

Each probationary certificated employee shall be evaluated at least once each school year. (Education Code 44664)

If the employee receives an unsatisfactory evaluation, he/she shall be annually evaluated until he/she achieves a positive evaluation or is separated from the district. (Education Code 44664)

Alternatively, a permanent employee who has been employed by the district at least 10 years and who was rated in his/her previous evaluation as meeting or exceeding standards shall be evaluated at least every five years, if he/she and the evaluator so agree.

Instructional and noninstructional certificated employees shall have the right to respond in writing to their evaluation. This response shall become a permanent attachment to the employee's personnel file. (Education Code 44663)

If an employee is not performing satisfactorily according to teaching standards approved by the Governing Board pursuant to Education Code 44662, the Superintendent or designee shall so notify the employee in writing and shall describe the unsatisfactory performance. The Superintendent or designee shall confer with the employee, make specific recommendations as to areas needing improvement, and endeavor to provide assistance to the employee in his/her performance. (Education Code 44664)
