## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board desires to provide a research-based, sequential curriculum which promotes high levels of student achievement and emphasizes the development of basic skills, problem solving, and decision making.  Upon recommendation of the Superintendent or designee, the Board shall adopt a written district curriculum which describes, for each subject area and grade level, the content objectives which are to be taught in all district schools.

The district's curriculum shall be aligned with the district's vision and goals for student learning, Board policies, academic content standards, state curriculum frameworks, state and district assessments, graduation requirements, school and district improvement plans, and, when necessary, related legal requirements. 

The Superintendent or designee shall establish a process for curriculum development, selection, and/or adaptation which utilizes the professional expertise of teachers, principals, and district administrators representing various grade levels, disciplines, special programs, and categories of students as appropriate. The process also may provide opportunities for input from students, parents/guardians, representatives of local businesses and postsecondary institutions, and other community members.

CSBA NOTE:  Since instructional materials are often an important component of the curriculum, the process of adopting instructional materials should be coordinated with the curriculum review and adoption process. See BP/AR 6161.1 - Selection and Evaluation of Instructional Materials.
The selection and evaluation of instructional materials shall be coordinated with the curriculum development and evaluation process.

When presenting a recommended curriculum for adoption, the Superintendent or designee shall provide research, data, or other evidence demonstrating the proven effectiveness of the proposed curriculum. He/she also shall present information about the resources that would be necessary to successfully implement the curriculum and describe any modifications or supplementary services that would be needed to make the curriculum accessible to all students.

CSBA NOTE:  The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 52376 requires districts with high schools to compare their career technical education programs with state model curriculum standards at least every three years; see AR 6178 - Career Technical Education. At their discretion, districts may choose to establish a schedule of regular reviews in other subject areas to ensure continued alignment of district curricula with state standards.
The Board shall establish a review cycle for regularly evaluating the district's curriculum in order to ensure continued alignment with state and district goals for student achievement.  At a minimum, these reviews shall be conducted whenever the State Board of Education adopts new or revised content standards or the curriculum framework for a particular subject or when new law requires a change or addition to the curriculum.

In addition, the Board may require a review of the curriculum in one or more subject areas as needed in response to student assessment results; feedback from teachers, administrators, or parent/guardians; new research on program effectiveness; or changing student needs.
