## Policy Content

The Board of Education shall act by a majority vote of all of the membership constituting the Board, unless otherwise required by law.  (Education Code 35164, 35165)

An "action" by the Board means:  (Government Code 54952.6)

	A collective decision by a majority of the Board members
	 
	A collective commitment or promise by a majority of the Board members to make a positive or negative decision
	 
	A vote by a majority of the Board members when sitting as the Board upon a motion, proposal, resolution, order, or ordinance

The Board shall not take action by secret ballot, whether preliminary or final.  (Government Code 54953)

Actions taken by the Board in open session shall be recorded in the Board minutes.  (Education Code 35145)

Action on Non-Agenda Items

The Board may take action on a subject not appearing on the posted meeting agenda only after publicly identifying the item and if any one of the following conditions are met:  (Government Code 54954.2)

	When a majority of the Board determines that an emergency situation exists, as defined for emergency meetings pursuant to Government Code 54956.5
	 
	When two-thirds of the members present, or if less than two-thirds of the members are present then by a unanimous vote of all members present, determine that the need to take immediate action came to the District's attention after the agenda was posted
	 
	When an item appeared on the agenda of, and was continued from, a meeting that occurred not more than five days earlier
	 
	Until December 31, 2025, when a Board member requests to participate by teleconference due to emergency circumstances pursuant to Government Code 54953 so long as the timing of the request did not allow for sufficient time to place it on the agenda

Challenging Board Actions

Before seeking to file a civil action to stop or prevent a Brown Act violation or to invalidate a prior action taken by the Board, the District attorney's office or interested person shall first present a demand to "cure and correct" the alleged violation to the District. If the District receives a proper demand from the District attorney's office or any interested person to "cure and correct" an alleged violation of the Brown Act, the Board shall consult with legal counsel on if and how to respond as provided by law.  (Government Code 54960-54960.5)
