## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional regulation provides separate procedures for those students transferring from accredited schools as opposed to those students transferring from non-accredited schools. This regulation should be modified to reflect district practice. 
Definitions

An "accredited" school is one that has received accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) or other statewide or regional commissions or, in the case of a school outside California, by the equivalent governmental or other regional accrediting agency in that jurisdiction.

Transfers from Accredited Schools

Students transferring into the district from an accredited school shall receive full academic credit for previously completed courses when the sending district verifies that the student has satisfactorily completed those courses.  

Transfers from Non-Accredited Schools

When a student transfers from any non-accredited private, public, alternative, home or charter school, academic credit shall be subject to approval by the principal or designee at the enrolling school. Credits transferred from these schools shall be fully accepted when there is evidence that the course work completed is equivalent to similar courses offered in this district.

The principal or designee at the enrolling school shall be responsible for determining which of the student's credits are equivalent to district requirements. Guidelines for determining equivalency shall be developed by representative certificated staff familiar with the district's academic standards and graduation requirements.

CSBA NOTE:  Districts with elementary schools may wish to include the requirement that the entering student demonstrate grade level proficiency by taking the achievement tests offered by the district. The criteria below for evaluating prior high school course work may be adapted to apply to elementary or middle grade course work if desired. 
Students in grades K through 8 who transfer into the district without proof of having met the grade level proficiency standards in reading, mathematics and writing must take the appropriate standardized tests of these basic skills to facilitate proper placement.

CSBA NOTE: The following list includes suggestions for steps the district may use to determine whether credits for course work previously completed by transferring students are equivalent to credit for courses offered at the enrolling school. 
In determining equivalency, the principal and/or designated certificated staff representative may consider one or more of the following:
 

	A review of the description of academic content and time requirements of the course work completed by the student compared to academic content and time requirements at the enrolling school
	 
	An examination of the student's portfolio of work, papers, completed projects, graded tests or other documents demonstrating the student's level of skill and knowledge
	 
	An opportunity for the student to demonstrate skill by his/her  performance on appropriate course-challenging examinations, comprehensive final examinations and/or other culminating exercises used at the enrolling school
	 
	Verification by teacher observation, once the student has been placed in a course, that the student has reached a level of preparation consistent with his/her placement in that course


Appeals/Due Process

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice in consultation with legal counsel. 
If a student's parent/guardian disagrees with the school site staff's judgment on grade-level placement, course placement and/or equivalency of academic credit, the parent/guardian may appeal to the Superintendent or designee.

Within 10 working days of notification of placement or credit determination, the parent/guardian may request, in writing, a conference with the Superintendent or designee to review the school site staff's decision. 

The Superintendent or designee shall schedule a conference within 10 working days of the parent/guardian's request. This meeting may include the principal or designee, representatives of the school's certificated staff, and the student's parents/guardian. It shall be the parent/guardian's responsibility to present evidence that the facts do not support the school staff's decision on the student's placement and/or transferability of prior credits.

The Superintendent or designee's decision shall be final.
