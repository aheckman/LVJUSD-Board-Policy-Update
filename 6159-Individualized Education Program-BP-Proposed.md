## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide full educational opportunities to all students with exceptional needs. Students with exceptional needs shall receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and, to the maximum extent possible, shall be educated in the least restrictive environment with nondisabled students.

For each student with exceptional needs, an individualized education program (IEP) shall be developed which identifies the special education instruction and related services to be provided to the student. The Superintendent or designee shall develop administrative regulations regarding the membership of the IEP team, the team's responsibility to develop and regularly review the IEP, the contents of the IEP, and the development, review, and revision processes.

The District shall make FAPE available to individuals with disabilities ages 3-22 who reside in the District, including:  (Education Code 56040; 20 USC 1412; 34 CFR 300.17, 300.101, 300.104)

	Students who have been suspended or expelled from school
	 
	Students who are placed by the District in a nonpublic, nonsectarian school
	 
	Individuals age 18-22 years who are incarcerated in an adult correctional facility and were identified as being an individual with disabilities or had an IEP in their prior educational placement
