## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that appropriate dress and grooming by District employees contribute to a productive learning environment and model positive behavior. During school hours and at school activities, employees shall maintain professional standards of dress and grooming that demonstrate their high regard for education, present an image consistent with their job responsibilities and assignment, and do not endanger the health or safety of employees or students. All employees shall be held to the same standards unless their assignment provides for modified dress as approved by their supervisor.

The District shall allow employees to appear and dress in a manner consistent with their gender identity or gender expression.  (Government Code 12949)

The District shall not discriminate against employees based on hair texture and protective hairstyles, including, but not limited to, braids, locks, and twists.  (Government Code 12926)

The District shall not dismiss an employee, discriminate against an employee in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or refuse to hire a job applicant on the basis of religious dress or grooming practices.  (Government Code 12926, 12940)
