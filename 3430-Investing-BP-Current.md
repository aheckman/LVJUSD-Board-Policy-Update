## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 41001 requires most school district funds to be deposited into the county treasury. Education Code 41015 allows any Governing Board which has funds in a special reserve fund of the district or any surplus monies not required for immediate district operations to invest all or part of the funds in accordance with Government Code 16430 and 53601-53609. In addition, the district may invest money in accordance with Government Code 53635 when the district pools money in deposits or investments with other local agencies.
All or part of the special reserve fund of the district, or any surplus monies not required for the immediate necessities of the district, may be invested as allowed by law for public funds.  (Education Code 41015; Government Code 16430, 53601-53609, 53635)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 53607 allows the Board to delegate authority for investing or reinvesting district funds to the chief fiscal officer of the district for a one-year period. The chief fiscal officer shall make monthly reports of these transactions to the Board. The Board may review and renew the delegation of authority each year if desired, and has the right to revoke the authority. The following paragraph is optional.
The Governing Board authorizes the district's chief fiscal officer to invest and reinvest such funds on behalf of the district.  He/she shall make monthly reports of those transactions to the Board. The Board retains the right to revoke this authority at any time.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Pursuant to Government Code 53600.3-53600.5, persons authorized to make investment decisions for the district are fiduciaries subject to prudent investor standards. If the Board has not delegated investment authority to the chief fiscal officer as provided above, the following paragraph should be revised to indicate that the Board retains fiduciary responsibility. With regards to funds deposited in the county treasury, Government Code 27000.3 provides that the county treasurer serves as a fiduciary subject to prudent investor standards.
The Board recognizes that the district's chief fiscal officer has fiduciary responsibility for any funds invested outside the county treasury and is subject to prudent investor standards for investment decisions. As such, he/she shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the prevailing circumstances, including but not limited to the general economic conditions and the anticipated needs of the district. The investment objectives shall be to first safeguard the principal of the funds, then to meet the district's liquidity needs and, third, to achieve a return on the funds. (Government Code 53600.3, 53600.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph expands on the third objective described above.
In order to enhance investment return, the district's goal shall be to generate an investment yield that attains or exceeds a market-average rate of return through economic cycles.

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 27131 encourages a county, or city and county, that is investing surplus funds to establish a county treasury oversight committee. The county board of supervisors, in consultation with the county treasurer, shall determine the size and the categories which committee members shall represent. Pursuant to Government Code 27132, one of the members may be a representative selected by a majority of the board presidents of the school and community college districts in the county. In addition, Government Code 27133 requires that the county treasurer in any such county must annually prepare an investment policy, with specified components, to be reviewed and monitored by this committee.
The Board recognizes the importance of overseeing investments made with district funds, including investments by the county treasurer. The Superintendent or designee shall maintain ongoing communication with any county committee established for the purpose of overseeing county investments.  In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall keep the Board informed about county policies that guide the investment of these funds.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional.
The Board may establish an investment oversight committee to monitor the district's investments and make recommendations to the chief fiscal officer and the Board regarding investment policies.

Annual Statement of Investment Policy

CSBA NOTE: AB 2853 (Ch. 889, Statutes of 2004) amended Government Code 53646 to encourage, but no longer require, the district's chief fiscal officer to annually render a statement of investment policy to the Board and any district investment oversight committee. If the Board chooses to require the annual statement of investment policy, the Board must consider the policy, or any changes in the policy, at a public meeting.The following optional section is for use by Boards that choose to continue to require this annual statement of investment policy. The following paragraph may be revised if the district has not established a district investment oversight committee.
The district's chief fiscal officer shall annually provide to the Board and any district investment oversight committee a statement of the district's investment policy or, if all district surplus funds are invested with the county treasurer, the county's investment policy.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is based on a recommendation of the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission's Local Agency Investment Guidelines which suggest that legislative bodies vote on and approve the annual investment report, no later than the end of the first quarter of the year to which it applies.
The annual investment report shall be submitted no later than the end of the first quarter of the year to which it applies.

At a public meeting, the Board shall review this policy and discuss any changes to be made.  (Government Code 53646)

Quarterly Investment Reports

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 53646, as amended by AB 2853 (Ch. 889, Statutes of 2004), encourages but no longer requires the district's chief fiscal officer to provide quarterly reports of the district's investments to the Board, the Superintendent and the district's auditor. The following optional section is for use by Boards that choose to continue to require these quarterly reports. See the accompanying administrative regulation for information about the contents of the reports.If the district chooses to provide such reports, Government Code 53646 provides that the chief fiscal officer shall not be required to render a quarterly report for individual accounts that are less than $25,000. Also, the Board may require these reports more frequently and may revise the following paragraph accordingly.
The chief fiscal officer of the district shall provide the Board, Superintendent, and internal auditor with quarterly reports of district investments in individual accounts that are $25,000 or more.
