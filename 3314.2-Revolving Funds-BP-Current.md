## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42800 and 42820 authorize the Governing Board to establish a revolving cash fund to be used when there is a need to issue a payment for services or supplies that has an urgent deadline and to reduce the need for issuing numerous small warrants. In addition, the district may establish small revolving cash funds for use by school sites (i.e., petty cash funds); see AR 3451 - Petty Cash Funds. See BP/AR 3551 - Food Service Operations/Cafeteria Fund for language regarding the Cafeteria Revolving Cash Account established pursuant to Education Code 38091. The following optional policy may be modified to reflect the types of funds operated by the district. 
The Governing Board has a fiduciary responsibility to effectively manage and safeguard the district's assets and resources.  All revolving cash funds shall be subject to the internal control procedures established by the district to prevent and detect fraud, financial impropriety, or irregularity and shall be maintained in accordance with law and the California School Accounting Manual.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide regular reports to the Board regarding the use of revolving funds and the results of any audits conducted on the funds.

Standard Revolving Cash Fund

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that have adopted a resolution to establish a revolving cash fund for use by the district's chief accounting officer, pursuant to Education Code 42800-42806 and with the consent of the County Superintendent of Schools. Education Code 42800 requires the Board to adopt a resolution which specifies the necessity for the fund, the chief accounting officer designated by the Board, the purposes for which the fund shall be available, and the amount of the fund. Pursuant to Education Code 42800, the fund limit is the lesser of (1) two percent of the district's estimated expenditures for the current fiscal year or (2) $75,000 for an elementary or high school district or $150,000 for a unified district. As amended by AB 97 (Ch. 47, Statutes of 2013), Education Code 42800 provides that these dollar amounts may be increased annually by the percentage increase in the district's local control funding formula pursuant to Education Code 42238.01-42238.07. 
Pursuant to Education Code 42800, the Board has adopted a resolution establishing a revolving cash fund for use by the chief accounting officer.  The fund shall be used only for the purposes specified in the Board's resolution which may include, but are not limited to, payment for services or supplies for which there is an urgent deadline or to reduce the need for issuing numerous small warrants.

The chief accounting officer shall be covered by an individual bond or insurance in the amounts specified in law.  He/she shall ensure that payments from the fund are for services or materials that are a legal charge against the district and that a receipt is obtained setting forth the date, payee, purpose of the expenditure, and amount expended.  (Education Code 41021, 42801, 42801.5, 42804)

The Board may at any time reduce or discontinue the revolving cash fund.  (Education Code 42805)

Pre-Payment Revolving Cash Fund

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42820-42821 authorize the Board to establish a revolving fund for purchases in the amount of $1,000 or less. The maximum amount that may be available in the fund is specified in Education Code 42821 and ranges from $1,000 to $10,000 depending on the district's average daily attendance. The following optional section is for use by districts that have established such a fund. 
Pursuant to Education Code 42820, the Board has adopted a resolution establishing a pre-payment revolving cash fund for use by the individual so designated in the Board's resolution.

The fund shall be established in a bank or other institution whose deposits are federally insured and shall be within the maximum limit specified in law. (Education Code 42820)

The designated individual shall be authorized to make payments from the fund for purchases in the amount of $1,000 or less, including freight or tax.  He/she shall submit a monthly list of the payments to the Board for approval.  (Education Code 42821)

Any person who issues a check drawn on the fund shall be personally liable for the amount of the check if the expenditure is in violation of the district's rules and regulations with respect to the fund.  (Education Code 42821)

Alternative Revolving Cash Fund

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 42810 authorizes the Board to adopt a resolution to establish a revolving cash fund for use by school principals and other designated administrative staff for services or materials related to classroom instruction in an amount not to exceed three percent of the district's current year instructional supply budget. Education Code 42810 states that the resolution must specify the necessity for the fund, the principals and other administrative staff designated by the Board, the purposes for which the fund shall be available, and the amount of the fund. The following section is optional. 
Pursuant to Education Code 42810, the Board has adopted a resolution establishing a revolving cash fund for use by school principals and other administrative staff.  The fund shall be used for services or materials related to classroom instruction or to correct an error in a classified employee's salary pursuant to Education Code 45167, as specified in the Board's resolution.

The revolving cash fund for supplies shall be subject to the bonding provisions of Education Code 42801.

The principal or administrative staff member in whose name the revolving cash fund is created shall be responsible for all fund expenditures, subject to Board regulation.  (Education Code 42810)
