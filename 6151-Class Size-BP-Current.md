## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy should be revised to reflect the grade levels offered by the district and any related provisions found in collective bargaining agreements. AB 97 (Ch. 47, Statutes of 2013) eliminated the Class Size Reduction program for grades K-3 (Education Code 52120-52128) and the Morgan-Hart Class Size Reduction program for grades 9-12 (Education Code 52080-52090) and redirected the funding for both programs into the local control funding formula (LCFF). In place of the K-3 Class Size Reduction program, AB 97 added Education Code 42238.02 which creates what is now referred to as the K-3 Grade Span Adjustment (GSA) program. The GSA program requires districts, as a condition of receiving an additional adjustment to the K-3 base grant under the LCFF, to make progress toward maintaining an average class size of 24 students in those grades and achieve that level by the time the LCFF is fully implemented (estimated by the Department of Finance to be the 2020-21 fiscal year). An exception exists for districts that have negotiated a different ratio for each school site. Pursuant to Education Code 42238.02, the average class enrollment requirement cannot be waived by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Districts that choose to reduce class size in any of grades 4-12 may do so at their discretion and may establish priorities for smaller class size aligned with the goals in their local control and accountability plan developed pursuant to Education Code 52060-52077, as added by AB 97. 
The Governing Board recognizes that smaller classes may contribute to student learning by allowing teachers to better identify and respond to individual student needs.  In accordance with negotiated employee agreements and state law, the Board shall establish class size limits appropriate for each grade level or subject taught and conducive to the effective use of teaching staff.

The highest priority for maintaining small class sizes shall be in the primary grades in order to support young students as they acquire the basic skills that serve as the foundation for subsequent learning. Other priorities shall be established in accordance with the goals and strategies identified in the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP).

CSBA NOTE: As noted above, Education Code 42238.02, as added by AB 97 (Ch. 47, Statutes of 2013), requires districts to make progress each year toward maintaining an average class enrollment of not more than 24 students by the time the LCFF is fully implemented. Average class enrollment must be determined and annual progress must be made pursuant to 5 CCR 15498-15498.3, as added by Register 2014, No. 14. Failure to make annual progress at every school site will result in the loss of the adjustment for the entire district, unless the district has negotiated an alternative average class size enrollment. If the district has negotiated an alternative average class enrollment, it may revise the following paragraph accordingly. 
For grades K-3, the district shall annually make progress toward maintaining an average class of not more than 24 students, unless an alternative annual average class size for each school site is collectively bargained.  (Education Code 42238.02; 5 CCR 15498-15498.3)

CSBA NOTE: According to the California Department of Education, transitional kindergarten classes are also subject to class size requirements under the LCFF and will be included in kindergarten class size calculations. 
Transitional kindergarten classes established pursuant to Education Code 48000 shall be included in the calculation of average class enrollment for kindergarten.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that maintain secondary grades and should be revised to reflect district priorities for class size reduction. 
At the secondary level, district priorities for class size reduction shall focus on English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and other courses that are necessary for completion of graduation requirements and shall be aligned with student needs as identified in the district's LCAP.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 56441.5 addresses appropriate ratios of instructional adults to students for students who are recieving group services for special education or related services. As amended by SB 436 (Ch. 386, Statutes of 2015), Education Code 56441.5 provides that, for special education students ages 3-5 years, this ratio must be lower than ratio for children in regular preschool program as set forth in Education Code 8264.8. Education Code 8264.8 sets the teacher-student ratio as 1:24 and the adult-student ratio as 1:8
For students who require special education and related services, the ratio of instructional adults to students in group services shall be dependent on the needs of the students. However, for children ages 3-5 years who are placed in group services, the teacher-child ratio shall be less than 1:8 and the adult-child ratio shall be less than 1:24. For children ages 3-5 years who are identified as severely disabled, the ratio of instructional adults to children shall not exceed 1:5.  (Education Code 8264.8, 56441.5)

The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board with an analysis of staffing and school facilities needs and other costs related to class size reduction proposals.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board regarding the impact of the class size reduction program on student achievement and other outcomes such as changes in school climate and student engagement.
