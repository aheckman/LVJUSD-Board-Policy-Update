## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes its responsibility to identify the most cost-efficient and effective method of financing when purchasing or modifying district facilities.  Financing may be necessary when it is determined that school facilities must be built or expanded to accommodate an increased or projected increased enrollment or when safety considerations and educational program improvements require the replacement, reconstruction, or modernization of existing facilities.

The Superintendent or designee shall research funding alternatives and recommend to the Board the method of funding that will best serve district needs as identified in the district's master plan for school facilities.

CSBA NOTE: The following list describes some of the facilities financing options available to school districts.
Funding alternatives may include, but are not be limited to:

	Levying developer fees pursuant to Education Code 17620 and Government Code 65995-65998
	 
	Forming a community facilities district pursuant to Government Code 53311-53368.3, the Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act
	 
	Forming a school facilities improvement district pursuant to Education Code 15300-15425
	 
	Issuing voter-approved general obligation bonds
	 
	Imposing a parcel tax pursuant to Government Code 50079
	 
	Using lease revenues for capital outlay purposes from surplus school property
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 (Education Code 17070.10-17079.30), the State Allocation Board provides state per-pupil funding, including hardship funding, for new school facilities construction and school facilities modernization for applicant school districts.
	Applying for state facilities funding pursuant to the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act  (Education Code 17070.10-17079.30)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 41024, districts that receive state facilities funding pursuant to the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act must annually report a detailed list of all expenditures of state funds and of the district's matching funds for completed projects until all funds are expended, and submit an audit of completed facilities projects within one year of project completion.  As amended by SB 820 (Ch. 110, Statutes of 2020), Education Code 41024 requires the auditor to file the audit with the California State Controller, who will then provide a copy of the audit to the California Department of Education and notify the Office of Public School Construction of any audit findings and any identified amounts to be adjusted.  See AR 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability for more specific information about reporting and auditing requirements.
	The district shall provide reports, maintain records, and provide for audits of the expenditure of state facilities funds as required by law and AR 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability.  (Education Code 41024)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 8855 requires districts to adopt a debt management policy prior to issuing any debt, such as general obligation bonds.  The policy must include (1) the purposes for which the debt proceeds may be used; (2) the types of debt that may be issued; (3) the relationship of the debt to, and integration with, the district's capital improvement program or budget, if applicable; (4) policy goals related to the district's planning goals and objectives; and (5) internal control procedures to ensure that the proceeds of the proposed debt issuance will be directed to the intended use.  See BP 3470 - Debt Issuance and Management.
As applicable, the district shall comply with BP 3470 - Debt Issuance and Management.
