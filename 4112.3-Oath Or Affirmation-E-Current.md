## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph reproduces the first paragraph of the California Constitution, Article 20, Section 3.  The second paragraph of that section, which further swears that the individual does not advocate the overthrow of the U.S. or California state government or belong to any party or organization that so advocates, is not included since the California Supreme Court has declared that part of Section 3 to be unconstitutional.  (Vogel v. County of Los Angeles (1967) 68 Cal 2d 18, 22)
I,  ____________________________________________________________,  do  solemnly  swear  (or  affirm)  that  I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of  California  against  all  enemies,  foreign  and  domestic;  that  I  will  bear  true  faith  and allegiance  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States  and  the  Constitution  of  the  State  of California; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph reflects Government Code 3100-3102.
I  understand  that  as  a  public  employee  I  am  a  disaster  service  worker  pursuant  to Government Code 3100 and 3102 and that I am required to take this oath before entering the duties of my employment.  In the event of natural, manmade or war-caused emergencies which result in conditions of disaster or extreme peril to life, property and resources, I am subject to disaster services activities assigned to me by my supervisor.
