## Policy Content

As part of the district's site selection process, the Superintendent or designee shall:

	Meet with appropriate local government recreation and park authorities to review all possible methods of coordinating the planning, design, and construction of new school facilities and school sites or major additions to existing school facilities and recreation and park facilities in the community.  (Education Code 35275)
	 
	Notify the appropriate local planning agency in writing and request its report and recommendations regarding the proposed site or proposed addition's conformity with the adopted general plan.  (Government Code 65402; Public Resources Code 21151.2)
	 
	Have the site investigated by competent personnel with regard to population trends, transportation, water supply, waste disposal facilities, utilities, traffic hazards, surface drainage conditions, and other factors affecting initial and operating costs. This investigation shall include geological and soil engineering studies to preclude locating the school on terrain that has the potential for earthquake or other geologic hazard damage as specified in Government Code 65302.  (Education Code 17212-17212.5)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 17212.2 authorizes the district to request information from the following entities in order to evaluate the safety of a proposed site.
	Make a written request for information necessary or useful to assess and determine the safety of a proposed school site, or an addition to an existing school site, from a person, corporation, public utility, locally publicly owned utility, or governmental agency regarding pipelines, electric transmission and distribution lines, railroads, and storage tanks in accordance with law.  (Education Code 17212.2, 17251)
	 
	Ensure that the site meets state standards for school site selection as specified in 5 CCR 14010-14012.
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Public Resources Code 21092, 21092.2, 21092.3, and 21152, as amended by AB 819 (Ch. 97, Statutes of 2021), districts are required to (1) post specified notices to the district's web site, (2) submit a notice of determination or notice of exemption with the county clerk electronically, if that option is offered by the county clerk, and (3) file an environmental notice with the Office of Planning and Research using their online process.
	Ensure compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as required by law, including posting required notices to the district web site.  (Public Resources Code 21000-21177)
	 
	Notify the California Department of Education in writing before acquiring title or leasing the site if the proposed site is within two miles of the air line of an airport runway or proposed runway.  (Education Code 17215)
	 
	Conduct an air quality analysis pursuant to Health and Safety Code 44360 and Education Code 17213 if the proposed site is within 500 feet of the edge of the closest traffic lane of a freeway or other busy traffic corridor and determine that the air quality at the proposed site is such that neither short-term nor long-term exposure poses significant health risks to students.  (Education Code 17213)

CSBA NOTE: Both a Phase I environmental assessment and a preliminary endangerment assessment, if necessary, must be conducted pursuant to Education Code 17213.1 to determine whether a release of hazardous materials has occurred, as provided in Item #1 below. The district must submit these documents to CDE and the Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) for review. If hazardous substances are disclosed, Education Code 17213.1 authorizes DTSC to order the district to complete certain "response actions" prior to securing state funding.
In the selection and development of projects funded pursuant to the School Facilities Program of 1998 (Proposition 1A) as contained in Education Code 17070.10-17077.10, the Superintendent or designee shall:

	Determine whether the proposed site is free of toxic contamination by ensuring that a Phase I environmental assessment and/or preliminary endangerment assessment is conducted as required by law  (Education Code 17213.1)
	
	The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the preliminary endangerment assessment is made available for public review and comment in accordance with Education Code 17213.1.
	 
	Submit an annual summary report of expenditures to the State Allocation Board in accordance with law  (Education Code 17076.10)
	 
	Include in the plans a hard-wired connection to a public switched telephone network or utilization of wireless technology  (Education Code 17077.10)
	
	CSBA NOTE: The Office of Public School Construction recommends that districts consult with legal counsel to ensure compliance with the disabled veteran provisions of Item #4 below.
	Establish a participation goal of at least three percent, per year, of the overall dollar amount expended each year by the district for disabled veteran business enterprises  (Education Code 17076.11)
