## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 48200, children ages 6-18 years are subject to compulsory, full-time education, except when otherwise exempted.Verification of absences is necessary for purposes of enforcement of compulsory education laws and for the determination of whether a student is truant. Pursuant to Education Code 48260, students with a valid excused absence are not truant.For strategies to reduce chronic absences, see BP/AR 5113.1 - Chronic Absence and Truancy and CSBA's governance brief, "Seize the Data: Using Chronic Absence Data to Drive Student Engagement." For information about the impact of absences on a student's grades, see BP 5121 - Grades/Evaluation of Student Achievement.
The Governing Board believes that regular attendance plays an important role in student achievement. The Board shall work with parents/guardians and students to ensure their compliance with all state attendance laws and may use appropriate legal means to correct problems of chronic absence or truancy.

In accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation, absence from school shall be excused only for health reasons, family emergencies, and justifiable personal reasons as specified in Education Code 48205, and work in the entertainment or allied industry as permitted pursuant to Education Code 48225.5.

CSBA NOTE: When a student has an excused absence pursuant to Education Code 48205 or 48225.5, teachers are required to provide equivalent assignments and tests, as described below. While teachers are not required to do so for other excused absences, the following language extends this requirement to all excused absences for fairness, and to maintain student engagement in the educational program. Districts may modify the following paragraph to reflect that it only applies to excused absences pursuant to Education Code 48205 and 48225.5.
When a student's absence from school is excused, the student's teacher shall determine identical or reasonably equivalent assignments and tests to those missed during the absence which the student shall be permitted to complete for full credit within a reasonable amount of time as determined by the teacher.  (Education Code 48205, 48225.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Pursuant to Education Code 46014, districts, with the written consent of the student's parent/guardian, may excuse a student from school in order to participate in religious exercises or instruction. In order for the district to receive average daily attendance funding for such absences, the Governing Board is required to first adopt a resolution permitting an excused absence for this purpose. The Board is also mandated to adopt regulations governing students' attendance at such exercises or instruction and the reporting of these absences; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
Student absence for religious instruction or participation in religious exercises away from school property may be considered excused subject to law and administrative regulation.  (Education Code 46014)

Inasmuch as school attendance and class participation are integral to students' learning experiences, parents/guardians and students shall be encouraged to schedule medical and other appointments during non-school hours.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46010.1 and the California Supreme Court in American Academy of Pediatrics et al v. Lungren et al., minor students do not need parent/guardian consent to obtain confidential medical services, and schools are authorized to excuse a student from school to obtain such services.
Students shall not be absent from school without their parents/guardians' knowledge or consent, except in cases of medical emergency or, as authorized pursuant to Education Code 46010.1, for a confidential medical appointment.

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 421 requires the Board to approve reasonable methods for verifying student absences due to illness or quarantine. See the accompanying administrative regulation for examples of methods of verification.
The Board shall, by resolution entered into its minutes, approve reasonable methods that may be used to verify student absences due to illness or quarantine.  (5 CCR 421)
