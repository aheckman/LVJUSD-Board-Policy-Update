## Policy Content

Any District employee who desires to resign his/her position shall submit, in writing, a letter of resignation which indicates the date which the employee intends as his/her last day at work.  The Board of Education encourages employees to provide advance notice that is appropriate for the position they hold.

The Board authorizes the Superintendent or designee to accept an employee's written resignation and to set its effective date. Once the Superintendent or designee has accepted and set an effective date for this resignation, the resignation may not thereafter be withdrawn by the employee.

The effective date of the resignation shall be a date not later than the close of the school year during which the resignation is received.  However, an employee and the Board may agree that a resignation will be accepted at a mutually agreed upon date not later than two years beyond the close of the school year during which the resignation is received by the Board.   (Education Code 44930, 45201)
