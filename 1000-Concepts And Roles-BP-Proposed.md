## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to represent the community and provide leadership in addressing community issues related to education.  In order to identify community concerns and enlist support for the schools, the Board shall establish effective two-way communication systems between schools and the community. 

Schools, parents/guardians, community members and local organizations must continually collaborate as partners.  The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall work together with city and county agencies and organizations to promote and facilitate coordinated services for children, and shall seek to develop partnerships with local businesses.

The Board recognizes that schools are an important community resource and encourages community members to make appropriate use of school facilities.  Community members are also encouraged to attend Board meetings, participate in school activities, and take an active interest in issues that affect the schools.  The Board and Superintendent or designee shall keep community members well informed about District needs and accomplishments and shall ensure that they have opportunities to share in developing educational policies, programs and evaluation processes. 

The Board recognizes that its ability to fulfill the community's expectations for a high-quality educational program depends on the level of support provided by the state and federal government as well as the community.  The Board therefore shall study legislative processes and issues, establish ongoing relationships with state and local leaders and the media, adopt positions on key issues, set priorities for advocacy, and collaborate with other organizations and coalitions in legislative and legal advocacy efforts.
