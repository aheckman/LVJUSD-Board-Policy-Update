## Policy Content

The Board of Education is committed to protecting the safety of students and staff and the security of District property.  The District shall develop a multi-tiered approach focused on the prevention of school violence and crime and the development of a positive school culture, which may include providing mental health services and other student support services, implementing restorative justice practices, implementing professional development addressing cultural competency, and employing and/or contracting with a law enforcement agency to provide school resource officers (SROs) on school campuses and/or school activities.

In order to reduce unnecessary law enforcement interactions with students, the Superintendent or designee shall provide training to school staff regarding the role of SROs and the appropriate circumstances for contacting such officers.

The Board shall approve a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the local law enforcement agency which includes, at a minimum:

	The purpose of the agreement
	 
	A clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of the District, school site, law enforcement agency, and SROs, including responsibility for supervision of the SRO
	 
	The extent to which information will be shared between the District and law enforcement agency consistent with state and federal laws
	 
	Requirements for qualifications and training of SROs
	 
	Assigned hours of SRO duty in and around schools
	 
	Performance monitoring

The Board may expand on the above requirements to include more specific terms, such as acknowledgement of nondiscrimination requirements, training focused on eliminating disproportionalities in SRO contacts with students, and staffing of an SRO position when the assigned SRO is on leave.

Duties

SROs are duly sworn peace officers who are authorized to carry out their duties pursuant to state law.

Job duties of the SRO shall not include the handling of student code of conduct violations or routine student disciplinary matters that should be addressed by school administrators, or conduct that would be better addressed by mental health professionals.

SROs shall be expected to collaborate with District staff in problem solving and, when circumstances warrant intervention with students, to use positive and restorative approaches in accordance with Penal Code 13651.  SROs shall use tactics such as de-escalation techniques to mitigate the use of force in an educational setting and shall strictly adhere to the policy on minimum use of force pursuant to Government Code 7286.

When approved by the Superintendent or designee, an SRO may provide classroom presentations and/or parent/guardian education pertaining to safety issues and may link students, parents/guardians, and staff with resources and services.

Qualifications of Officers

Prior to beginning their assignment when possible, SROs shall complete specialized training in school policing, the unique experiences of the diverse populations within the school community, and the law enforcement agency's use of force policy.

Nondiscrimination

SROs shall not discriminate against or treat any person differently on the basis race, color, ancestry, nationality, national origin, immigration status, ethnic group identification, ethnicity, age, religion, marital status, pregnancy, parental status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or genetic information; a perception of one or more of such characteristics; or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.

The Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Board disaggregated data on student interactions with SROs to evaluate the appropriateness of such interactions and ensure compliance with the prohibition against nondiscrimination.  Such reports may include the number of arrests and referrals for prosecution, the number of reports provided to the school or District regarding student misconduct, or other actions taken by SROs with respect to individual students or others on campus.

As necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement practices to prevent disproportionality of student interactions with SROs based on student characteristics and to minimize the potential for referrals of students into the juvenile justice system.

Access to Records

SROs shall not have access to student records, nor release student information to another person, agency, or organization, without written permission from the parent/guardian or adult student, unless specifically allowed or required by state or federal law.  (Education Code 49076; 34 CFR 99.1)

SROs shall not solicit or collect information or documents regarding the citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members or provide assistance with immigration enforcement at District schools, except as may be required by state and/or federal law.  (Education Code 234.7)
