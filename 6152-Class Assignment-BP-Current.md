## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.Pursuant to Education Code 51224.7, as added by SB 359 (Ch. 508, Statutes of 2015), the Governing Board of any district which serves students in grade 9 is mandated to adopt a mathematics placement policy with specified components before the 2016-17 school year. See BP 6152.1 - Placement in Mathematics Courses for language fulfilling this mandate.
The Governing Board believes students should be assigned to classes and/or grouped in a manner that provides the most effective learning environment for all students.

When assigning students to specific courses and classes, the principal or designee may consider the following criteria as appropriate for the grade level and course:
 

	Staff recommendation, including, but not limited to, the recommendations of teachers and counselors
	 
	Skills and classroom management style of individual teachers
	 
	Student skill level as indicated by multiple objective academic measures, such as student assessment results, grade point average, and grades in prerequisite courses
	 
	Balance of high, medium, and low academic achievers
	 
	Student interests, readiness, behavior, and motivation
	 
	Student/teacher ratios and, if relevant, class size reduction considerations


The principal or designee may accept from parents/guardians any information which would be helpful in making placement decisions. However, a parent/guardian who provides such information shall be informed that a request for a specific teacher shall be one of many factors which may be taken into account when determining his/her child's placement.

During the school year, the principal or designee may make any adjustments in class placement which he/she considers beneficial to the student or the educational program.

Additional Requirements for Grades 9-12

Except for a student enrolled in an alternative school, community day school, continuation high school, or opportunity school, or as otherwise specified below, no student enrolled in grades 9-12 shall be assigned:

CSBA NOTE: Beginning with the 2016-17 school year, Education Code 51228.1, as added by AB 1012 (Ch. 703, Statutes of 2015), prohibits districts from assigning a student in grades 9-12 to any course period "without educational content," as defined, for more than one week in any semester. Exceptions are permitted under certain conditions, as specified below.


	To any course without educational content for more than one week in any semester, including any of the following situations:  (Education Code 51228.1)
	 
	
		The student is sent home or released from campus before the conclusion of the designated school day.
		 
		The student is assigned to a service, instructional work experience, or other course in which he/she is assigned to assist a certificated employee, but is not expected to complete curricular assignments, in a course the certificated employee is teaching during that period and where the ratio of certificated employees to students assigned to the course for curricular purposes is less than one to one.
		 
		The student is not assigned to any course for the relevant course period.
		
		CSBA NOTE:  Education Code 51228.2, as added by AB 1012 (Ch. 703, Statutes of 2015), prohibits assigning a student in grades 9-12 to any course that he/she previously completed with a grade that satisfies minimum requirements for high school graduation and admission to California public postsecondary institutions. For this purpose, the district must identify the grade that the student must have achieved in that course. The district may modify item #2 below to specify the grade that will be used to establish satisfactory completion of the course.
	
	
	To a course that he/she has previously completed and received a grade determined by the district to be sufficient to satisfy minimum high school graduation requirements and the requirements and prerequisites for admission to California public postsecondary institutions, unless the course has been designed to be taken more than once because students are exposed to a new curriculum year to year and are therefore expected to derive educational value from taking the course again (Education Code 51228.2)
	 

An exception to item #1 or #2 above may be made only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:  (Education Code 51228.1, 51228.2)
 

	The student, or the student's parent/guardian if he/she is younger than age 18 years, has consented in writing to the assignment.
	 
	A school official has determined that the student will benefit from being assigned to the course period.
	 
	The principal or assistant principal has stated in a written document maintained at the school that, for the relevant school year, no students are assigned to those classes unless the school has obtained the student's or parent/guardian's consent and determined that the student will benefit from the assignment.


In addition, under no circumstances shall a student be assigned to a course period without educational content or a course he/she has already satisfactorily completed because there are insufficient curricular course offerings for the student to take during the relevant period of the school day.  (Education Code 51228.1, 51228.2)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph may be revised to reflect programs offered by the district. Education Code 51228.1 does not limit the authority of districts to offer independent study, dual enrollment in community college, evening high school programs, work-based learning or work experience education, or any class or course authorized under Education Code 51705-51879.9.
The above limitations on class assignments shall not affect the authority of the Superintendent or designee to permit the enrollment of a student in a dual enrollment, independent study, evening high school program, or other class or course authorized by law.  (Education Code 51228.1, 51228.2)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51228.3, as added by AB 1012 (Ch. 703, Statutes of 2015), complaints regarding the district's noncompliance with Education Code 51228.1 or 51228.2 may be addressed through uniform complaint procedures (5 CCR 4600-4687); also see AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.
Any complaint that the district has not complied with the requirements in this section regarding assignments in grades 9-12 may be filed in accordance with the district's procedures in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures. A complainant not satisfied with the district's decision may appeal the decision to the California Department of Education (CDE). If the district or the CDE finds merit in an appeal, the district shall provide a remedy to the affected student.  (Education Code 51228.3; 5 CCR 4600-4687)
