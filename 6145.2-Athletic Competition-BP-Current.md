## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE:     Pursuant to Education Code 35179, the Governing Board has control of and responsibility for all aspects of district interscholastic athletic policies, programs, and activities.Pursuant to Education Code 51242, the Board may exempt any high school student engaged in a school-sponsored interscholastic athletic program after regular school hours from the requirement to attend physical education courses; see BP 6142.7 - Physical Education and Activity.
The Governing Board recognizes that the district's athletic program constitutes an integral component of the educational program and helps to build a positive school climate. The athletic program also promotes the physical, social, and emotional well-being and character development of participating students. The district's athletic program shall be designed to meet students' interests and abilities and shall be varied in scope to attract wide participation.

All athletic teams shall be supervised by qualified coaches to ensure that student athletes receive appropriate instruction and guidance related to safety, health, sports skills, and sportsmanship.  Athletic events shall be officiated by qualified personnel.

The Board encourages business and community support for district athletic programs, subject to applicable district policies and regulations governing advertisements and donations.

Nondiscrimination and Equivalent Opportunities in the Athletic Program

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35179, the Board is responsible for ensuring that district and interscholastic athletic policies, programs, and activities are in compliance with law. Gender equity and nondiscrimination in district and interscholastic athletic programs and activities are governed by both federal law (Title IX, 20 USC 1681-1688) and state law (Education Code 200-262.4; 5 CCR 4900-4965).In Mansourian v. Regents of University of California, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a university receiving federal funds can be held liable for failing to effectively accommodate the athletic interests of both men and women even if the aggrieved women did not first provide the appropriate university officials with notice of their disadvantageous treatment and an opportunity to cure it. See the accompanying administrative regulation for factors the district must consider in determining whether equivalent opportunities are being provided.Education Code 221.2-221.3 (the California Racial Mascot Act) declare the use of racially derogatory or discriminatory school or athletic team names, mascots, or nicknames in public schools to be contrary to an equal education and specifically prohibit public schools from using the term "Redskins" as a school or athletic team name, mascot, or nickname. The following paragraph includes an expansion of this prohibition to cover any racially derogatory or discriminatory athletic team name, mascot, or nickname and may be revised to reflect district practice. Also see BP 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities.
The district's athletic program shall be free from discrimination and discriminatory practices prohibited by state and federal law, including, but not limited to, the use of any racially derogatory or discriminatory school or athletic team name, mascot, or nickname. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that equivalent athletic opportunities are provided for males and females, and that students are permitted to participate in athletic activities consistent with their gender identity.

Any complaint alleging discrimination in the district's athletic program shall be filed in accordance with the district's uniform complaint procedures.

California Interscholastic Federation

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that maintain grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code 35179, the district may join an association, such as the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF), for the purpose of providing regional or statewide interscholastic athletic programs and activities for district students. Pursuant to Education Code 33353, CIF is responsible for setting rules governing interscholastic athletic programs. Students who attend schools that participate in interscholastic sports are therefore subject to CIF regulations as well as applicable district rules.
Any district school that participates in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) shall conduct its athletic activities in accordance with CIF bylaws and rules and any applicable district policy and regulation. The Superintendent or designee shall have responsibility for the district's interscholastic athletic program, while the principal or designee at each participating school shall be responsible for site-level decisions, as appropriate.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to CIF rules established in accordance with Education Code 33353, the Board is required to designate an individual from each school that participates in CIF sports to serve as a representative to the local CIF league. The name and contact information of these representatives must be annually reported to CIF. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Board shall annually designate a representative to the local CIF league from each school that participates in CIF sports. The Superintendent or designee shall recommend a candidate for the position who demonstrates an understanding of the district's goals for student learning and interscholastic activities, knowledge of the athletic programs, awareness of the implications of league decisions for the school and the district, and interpersonal communication and leadership skills.

The designated representative(s) shall vote on issues that impact interscholastic athletics at the league and section levels, perform any other duties required by the CIF league, and report regularly to the Board on league, section, and statewide issues related to athletic programs.

Student Eligibility

CSBA NOTE: The following section provides that student eligibility for participation in athletic programs shall be based on the same criteria adopted by the Board for all other extracurricular or cocurricular activities (see BP/AR 6145 - Extracurricular and Cocurricular Activities), and may be revised to reflect district practice.Education Code 48850 specifies that a homeless student, or a foster youth whose residence changes pursuant to a court order or decision of a child welfare worker, shall be deemed to meet all residency requirements for participation in extracurricular activities and interscholastic sports; see AR 6173 - Education for Homeless Children and AR 6173.1 - Education for Foster Youth.In addition, Education Code 49700-49701 establish a uniform means of assisting children of active duty military families transferred from one state to another, by reducing or eliminating the barriers to their educational success caused by the frequent moves and deployments of their parents/guardians; see BP/AR 6173.2 - Education of Children of Military Families. Among other things, Education Code 49701 requires flexibility of districts' local rules to facilitate eligibility for extracurricular activities of children of military personnel.
Eligibility requirements for student participation in the district's interscholastic athletic program, including requirements pertaining to academic achievement, shall be the same as those set by the district for participation in extracurricular and cocurricular activities.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that participate in CIF. CIF bylaws specify eligibility criteria for participating student athletes, including criteria related to age, grade, attendance, scholastic achievement, residence, transfers, and discipline. In addition, in accordance with CIF bylaws, students in home schooling or home study/independent study programs are not eligible for CIF interscholastic competition unless they are enrolled in a program under the jurisdiction of a CIF member school district (i.e., a program in which the district approves the curriculum, administers the program, and evaluates the student).
In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that students participating in interscholastic athletics governed by CIF satisfy CIF eligibility requirements.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49010-49011 and the California Department of Education's (CDE) Fiscal Management Advisory 12-02, Pupil Fees, Deposits, and Other Charges, clarify that districts may not charge a fee for student participation in extracurricular activities, regardless of whether the activity is elective. Such prohibited fees include, but are not limited to, the cost of uniforms, locks, lockers, and equipment.However, pursuant to Education Code 32220-32224, the district may charge a fee for required medical and accident insurance for athletic team members that is not paid for with school district or student body funds, as long as costs for insurance are covered for those determined to be financially unable to pay; see the accompanying administrative regulation and AR 5143 - Insurance. The district may also charge a fee for other students to attend athletic events as spectators since such attendance is not directly related to the educational program. Districts are advised to seek legal counsel before charging a fee for any activity which may be construed as related to the educational program.
Students shall not be charged a fee to participate in an athletic program, including, but not limited to, a fee to cover the cost of uniforms, locks, lockers, or athletic equipment.

Sportsmanship

CSBA NOTE:  CIF has adopted a set of principles entitled Pursuing Victory with Honor to provide the tools for teaching character development to student athletes. Districts that are not affiliated with CIF may delete or modify the following optional section to reflect district practice.
The Board values the quality and integrity of the athletic program and the character development of student athletes. Student athletes, coaches, parents/guardians, spectators, and others are expected to demonstrate good sportsmanship, ethical conduct, and fair play during all athletic competitions. They shall also abide by the core principles of trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and good citizenship and the Code of Ethics adopted by CIF.

Students and staff shall be subject to disciplinary action for improper conduct.

Health and Safety

CSBA NOTE:  See the accompanying administrative regulation for additional requirements pertaining to the health and safety of student athletes, including students who experience concussions or other head injuries, heat illness, or sudden cardiac arrest.
The Board desires to give student health and safety the highest consideration in planning and conducting athletic activities.

CSBA NOTE: CIF requires students in grades 9-12 to undergo medical examinations before participating in interscholastic competition; see BP 5141.3 - Health Examinations. Pursuant to Education Code 49458, any examination required for participation in an interscholastic athletic program may be conducted by a physician or physician assistant.
Students shall have a medical clearance before participating in interscholastic athletic programs. Care shall be taken to ensure that all athletic trainings and competitions are conducted in a manner that will not overtax the physical capabilities of the participants. When appropriate, protective equipment shall be used to prevent or minimize injuries.

Coaches and appropriate district employees shall take every possible precaution to ensure that athletic equipment is kept in safe and serviceable condition.  The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all athletic equipment is cleaned and inspected for safety before the beginning of each school year.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35179.4, as added by AB 2009 (Ch. 646, Statutes of 2018), requires any district that offers an interscholastic athletic program to develop a written emergency action plan, as provided below. A sample emergency action plan that may be used in the event of sudden cardiac arrest, catastrophic injury, or other medical emergency is available on CIF's web site.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a written emergency action plan that describes the location of automated external defibrillator(s) and procedures to be followed in the event of sudden cardiac arrest or other medical emergency related to the athletic program's activities or events. The plan shall be posted in accordance with guidelines of the National Federation of State High School Associations.  (Education Code 35179.4)

In the event of a serious injury or a perceived imminent risk to a student's health during or immediately after an athletic activity, the coach or any other district employee who is present shall remove the student athlete from the activity, observe universal precautions in handling blood or other bodily fluid, and/or seek medical treatment for the student as appropriate.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
Whenever a serious injury or illness is suffered by a student athlete, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the student's parent/guardian of the date, time, and extent of any injury or illness suffered by the student and any actions taken to treat the student.
