## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy is for use by districts that maintain high schools and should be modified to reflect district practice.Pursuant to Education Code 56345 and 34 CFR 300.320, the individualized education program (IEP) for each student with a disability must contain a statement of measurable annual goals that would enable the student to progress in the general education curriculum, a statement regarding any accommodations necessary to measure the student's performance on state and district assessments, and any alternative means and modes necessary for the student to complete the district's prescribed course of study and to meet or exceed proficiency standards for graduation; see AR 6159 - Individualized Education Program for a detailed listing of the required contents of the IEP.Pursuant to Education Code 60900.2, as added by AB 1340 (Ch. 576, Statutes of 2023), and contingent upon funding for these purposes, the California Department of Education is required, on or before January 1, 2025, to report on its website statewide four and five year cohort graduation rates for students with disabilities disaggregated by the identified disability or disabilities as listed in 34 CFR 300.8.
The Governing Board recognizes that students with disabilities are entitled to a course of study that provides them with a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and that modifications to the district's regular course may be needed on an individualized basis to provide FAPE. In accordance with law, each student's individualized education program (IEP) team shall determine the appropriate goals, as well as any appropriate individual accommodations necessary for measuring the academic achievement and functional performance of the student on state and districtwide assessments.

Exemption from District-Established Graduation Requirements

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.31, as amended by  SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023) and SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), districts are required to exempt an eligible student with a disability, that entered the ninth grade in the 2022-23 school year and later, from all coursework and other requirements adopted by the Governing Board that are in addition to the statewide course requirements specified in Education Code 51225.3, and award such student a high school diploma, as reflected below.
District students shall complete all course requirements for high school graduation as specified in Board Policy 6146.1 - High School Graduation Requirements. However, a student with a disability that entered the ninth grade in the 2022-23 school year and later may be exempted from all coursework and other requirements adopted by the Board that are in addition to the statewide course requirements for high school graduation if the student's IEP provides for both of the following requirements:  (Education Code 51225.31).

	That the student is eligible to take the alternate assessment as described in Education Code 60640
	 
	That the student complete state standards aligned coursework to meet the statewide coursework specified in Education Code 51225.3

Any such exempted student shall receive a diploma and be eligible to participate in any graduation ceremony and school activity related to graduation in which a student of similar age without a disability would be eligible to participate.  (Education Code 51225.31)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.31, as amended by SB 114, participation in graduation activities by a student with a disability who is exempted from district-adopted graduation requirements that are in addition to the statewide course requirements specified in Education Code 51225.3, may not be construed as termination of the provision of the district's responsibility to provide a free appropriate public education, unless the student's IEP team, which includes the parent/guardian and student, has determined that the student has completed the high school experience.
The district's responsibility to provide FAPE shall not terminate when a student with a disability who is exempted from district-adopted graduation requirements participates in graduation activities unless the student's IEP team, which includes the parent/guardian and student, has determined that the student has completed the high school experience.  (Education code 51225.31)

Certificate of Educational Achievement or Completion

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 56390-56392 authorize a district to award a certificate of educational achievement to a student with a disability who meets the criteria specified below. Pursuant to Education Code 56391, a student who meets the criteria is eligible to participate in any graduation ceremony/activity in which a student of similar age without a disability would be eligible to participate. However, Education Code 56391 provides that the right to participate in graduation ceremonies does not equate a certificate or document of educational achievement with a regular diploma.
Instead of a high school diploma, a student with a disability may be awarded a certificate or document of educational achievement or completion if the student has met one of the following requirements:  (Education Code 56390)

	Satisfactorily completed a prescribed alternative course of study approved by the board of the district in which the student attended school or the district with jurisdiction over the student as identified in the student's IEP
	 
	Satisfactorily met the student's IEP goals and objectives during high school as determined by the IEP team
	 
	Satisfactorily attended high school, participated in the instruction as prescribed in the student's IEP, and met the objectives of the statement of transition services

A student with a disability who meets any of the criteria specified above shall be eligible to participate in any graduation ceremony and any school activity related to graduation in which a graduating student of similar age without disabilities would be eligible to participate.  (Education Code 56391)
