## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060-52077 require the Governing Board to adopt and annually update, on or before July 1, a three-year local control and accountability plan (LCAP). See the accompanying Board policy for information about LCAP development and monitoring.
Goals and Actions Addressing State and Local Priorities

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060 requires that the LCAP include annual goals, aligned with specified state priorities, to be achieved for all students and for each numerically significant subgroup as defined in Education Code 52052. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, a numerically significant subgroup includes ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, students experiencing homelessness, and, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), long-term English learners when there are at least 30 students in the subgroup (or at least 15 foster youth, students experiencing homelessness, or long-term English learners) in the school or district. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), a "long-term English learner" is defined as a student who has not attained English language proficiency within seven years of initial classification as an English learner.
The district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) shall include, for the district and each district school:  (Education Code 52060)

	A description of the annual goals established for all students and for each numerically significant subgroup as defined in Education Code 52052, including ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English learners, long-term English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and students experiencing homelessness
	
	The LCAP shall identify goals for each of the following state priorities:
	 
	
		The degree to which district teachers are appropriately assigned in accordance with Education Code 44258.9 and fully credentialed in the subject areas and for the students they are teaching; every district student has sufficient access to standards-aligned instructional materials as determined pursuant to Education Code 60119; and school facilities are maintained in good repair as specified in Education Code 17002
		 
		Implementation of the academic content and performance standards adopted by the State Board of Education (SBE), including how the programs and services will enable English learners to access the Common Core State Standards and the English language development standards for purposes of gaining academic content knowledge and English language proficiency
		
		CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060 provides that family engagement may include, but not be limited to, efforts by the district and schools to apply research-based practices, such as welcoming all families into the school community, engaging in effective two-way communication, supporting student success, and empowering families to advocate for equity and access. It may also include partnering with families to inform, influence, and create practices and programs that support student success and collaboration with families and the broader community, expand student learning opportunities, and promote civic participation.
		Parent/guardian involvement and family engagement, including efforts the district makes to seek parent/guardian input in district and school site decision making and how the district will promote parent/guardian participation in programs for unduplicated students, as defined in Education Code 42238.02, and students with disabilities
		 
		Student achievement, as measured by all of the following, as applicable:
		 
		
			Statewide assessments of student achievement
			 
			The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of California and the California State University; have successfully completed career technical education (CTE) sequences or programs of study that align with SBE-approved CTE standards and frameworks, including, but not limited to, those described in Education Code 52302, 52372.5, or 54692; and have successfully completed both college entrance courses and CTE sequences or programs
			 
			The percentage of English learners who make progress toward English proficiency as measured by the SBE-certified assessment of English proficiency
			 
			The English learner reclassification rate
			 
			The percentage of students who have passed an Advanced Placement examination with a score of 3 or higher
			 
			The percentage of students who demonstrate college preparedness in the Early Assessment Program pursuant to Education Code 99300-99301
			 
		
		
		Student engagement, as measured by school attendance rates, chronic absenteeism rates, middle school dropout rates, high school dropout rates, and high school graduation rates, as applicable
		 
		School climate, as measured by student suspension and expulsion rates and other local measures, including surveys of students, parents/guardians, and teachers on the sense of safety and school connectedness, as applicable
		 
		The extent to which students have access to and are enrolled in a broad course of study that includes all of the subject areas described in Education Code 51210 and 51220, as applicable, including the programs and services developed and provided to unduplicated students and students with disabilities, and the programs and services that are provided to benefit these students as a result of supplemental and concentration grant funding pursuant to Education Code 42238.02 and 42238.03
		 
		Student outcomes, if available, in the subject areas described in Education Code 51210 and 51220, as applicable
		
		CSBA NOTE: In addition to goals aligned with the state priorities described in Item #1 above, Education Code 52060 provides that the LCAP may include goals for local priorities established by the Board; see the accompanying Board policy. Optional Item #2 below may be revised to reflect local priorities.
	
	
	Any goals identified for any local priorities established by the Governing Board
	 
	A description of the specific actions the district will take during each year of the LCAP to achieve the identified goals, including the enumeration of any specific actions necessary for that year to correct any deficiencies in regard to the state and local priorities specified in Items #1-2 above
	
	Such actions shall not supersede provisions of existing collective bargaining agreements within the district.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 52060, in developing goals and actions for the LCAP, the Board may consider qualitative information, including, but not limited to, the results of school quality reviews conducted pursuant to Education Code 52052. Education Code 52052 authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction, with approval of the State Board of Education (SBE) and conditional upon an appropriation in the state budget, to develop and implement a program of school quality reviews that features locally convened panels to visit schools, observe teachers, interview students, and examine student work.
For purposes of the descriptions required by Items #1-3 above, the Superintendent or designee may consider qualitative information, including, but not limited to, findings that result from any school quality review conducted pursuant to Education Code 52052 or any other reviews.  (Education Code 52060)

For any local priorities addressed in the LCAP, the Superintendent or designee shall identify and include in the LCAP the method for measuring the district's progress toward achieving those goals.  (Education Code 52060)

To the extent practicable, data reported in the LCAP shall be reported in a manner consistent with how information is reported on the California School Dashboard.  (Education Code 52060)

Increase or Improvement in Services for Unduplicated Students

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that receive local control funding formula (LCFF) supplemental and/or concentration grant funds. Such districts are required to increase or improve services for unduplicated students in proportion to the increase in funds apportioned on the basis of the number and concentration of unduplicated students; see BP 3100 - Budget. 5 CCR 15494-15496 specify the method for determining the percentage by which services for unduplicated students must be increased or improved above services provided to all students in the fiscal year.
The LCAP shall demonstrate how the district will increase or improve services for unduplicated students at least in proportion to the increase in funds apportioned on the basis of the number and concentration of unduplicated students.  (5 CCR 15494-15496)

When the district expends supplemental and/or concentration grant funds on a districtwide or schoolwide basis during the year for which the LCAP is adopted, the district's LCAP shall:  (5 CCR 15496)

	Identify those services that are being funded and provided on a districtwide or schoolwide basis
	 
	Describe how such services are principally directed towards, and are effective in, meeting the district's goals for unduplicated students in the state priority areas and any local priority area
	 
	If the enrollment of unduplicated students is less than 55 percent of district enrollment or less than 410 percent of school enrollment, describe how these services are the most effective use of the funds to meet the district's goals for its unduplicated students in the state priority areas and any local priority areas
	
	The description shall provide the basis for this determination, including, but not limited to, any alternatives considered and any supporting research, experiences, or educational theory.

Timeline

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52061-52065 only establish a limited number of date-specific requirements. For instance, Education Code 52062, as amended by SB 114, requires the Superintendent to annually report to the Board, at a regular meeting, on the annual update to the LCAP and the local control funding formula budget overview for parents/guardians on or before February 28. However, while Education Code 52062 requires that the LCAP and the annual update be presented to specified committees, it does not specify by when this must occur. Similarly, while Education Code 52062 provides these committees with the right to submit comments and requires the Superintendent to respond in writing to such comments, it does not provide any deadlines by which these actions must occur. Education Code 52062 also requires, without a specific deadline, notification to the public of the opportunity to submit written comments on the proposed LCAP, including notification in the primary language of parents/guardians when required by Education Code 48985.Pursuant to Education Code 52062, as amended by SB 153 (Ch. 38, Statutes of 2024), the Superintendent is required to present the annual report on the update to the LCAP and budget overview for parents/guardians as a nonconsent item at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board.The following paragraphs include both required dates and recommended dates based on best practice. Districts should review the dates below carefully and modify them, as appropriate and permitted by law, to reflect district practice.
By February 28 of each year, the Superintendent or designee shall provide a report to the Board on the annual update to the LCAP and the budget overview for parents/guardians. The report, which shall be presented to the Board at a regular meeting as a nonconsent item, shall include all available midyear outcome data related to metrics identified in the current year's LCAP and all available midyear expenditure and implementation data on all actions identified in the current year's LCAP.  (Education Code 52062)

By May 15, but in no event later than May 31, the Superintendent or designee shall present the drafts of the LCAP and the annual update to the committees listed in the accompanying Board policy for review and comment and shall provide each committee with a reasonable date by which each committee shall provide comments on the drafts. The Superintendent or designee shall respond in writing to comments received from the committee(s) no later than the public hearing on the LCAP and the annual update.

At the same time as the drafts of the LCAP and the annual update are presented to these committees, the Superintendent or designee shall notify members of the public of the opportunity to submit written comments regarding the specific actions and expenditures proposed to be included in the LCAP. The notification shall be provided using the most efficient method of notification possible, which may not necessarily include producing printed notices or sending notices by mail. The notification shall also provide the deadline by which all written comments must be received, which shall be no later than the deadline for comments from the committee(s). All such written notifications shall be provided in the primary language of parents/guardians when required by Education Code 48985.  (Education Code 52062)

Availability

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52065 requires the Superintendent to prominently post the LCAP, including any annual update or revisions to the LCAP and the budget overview for parents/guardians, on the homepage of its website and, as amended by SB 609 (Ch. 494, Statutes 2023), on the performance overview portion of the California School Dashboard.Pursuant to Education Code 52064.3, as amended by SB 153, beginning July 1, 2027, if the district is identified by SBE as needing an improvement plan pursuant to 34 CFR 300.600-300.647, the Board shall adopt, and update on an annual basis, an Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Addendum, based on the template adopted by SBE. However, if the district adopts an improvement plan after being identified, but before July 1, 2027, the IDEA Addendum shall be developed upon expiration of the adopted improvement plan, but no later than July 1, 2030.
The Superintendent or designee shall prominently post the LCAP, any updates or revisions to the LCAP, the annual update, the IDEA Addendum as applicable, and the local control funding formula budget overview for parents/guardians on the homepage of the district's website and the performance overview portion of the Dashboard.  (Education Code 52064.1, 52064.3, 52065)
