## Policy Content

Review Process

CSBA NOTE: The following section may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Education Code 60002, the district must provide for "substantial" teacher involvement in the selection of instructional materials and must promote the involvement of parents/guardians and other members of the community in the selection of instructional materials. The Education Code does not define "substantial."
The district's review process for evaluating instructional materials shall involve teachers in a substantial manner and shall encourage the participation of parents/guardians and community members in accordance with Education Code 60002. The review process may also involve administrators, other staff who have subject-matter expertise, and students as appropriate. The Superintendent or designee shall seek input from stakeholders with diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that maintain any of grades K-8.
If the district is considering the use of instructional materials for grades K-8 that have not been adopted by the State Board of Education (SBE), the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a majority of the participants in the district's review process are classroom teachers who are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials.  (Education Code 60210)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. The use of review committees is recommended as a best practice, but is not required by law.
The Superintendent or designee may establish an advisory committee to conduct the review of instructional materials.

The Superintendent or designee shall present to the Governing Board recommendations for instructional materials and documentation that supports the recommendations.

All recommended instructional materials shall be available for public inspection at the district office.

CSBA NOTE: The State Board of Education's (SBE) policy, "Guidelines for Piloting Textbooks and Instructional Materials," provides a sample process for piloting instructional materials that addresses the selection of materials to pilot, a chronology of the process, and additional considerations, such as conflict of interest, contacts with publishers, and consideration of standards maps.
When possible, the district may pilot instructional materials in a representative sample of classrooms for a specified period of time during a school year, in order to determine the extent to which the materials support the district's curricular goals and academic standards, and accurately reflect and value society's diversity. Feedback from teachers piloting the materials shall be made available to the Board before the materials are adopted.

Criteria for Selection and Adoption of Instructional Materials

In recommending instructional materials for adoption by the Board, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the materials:

CSBA NOTE: The California Department of Education (CDE) provides guidance, available on its website, for the selection of instructional materials that are not adopted by SBE, which includes that districts develop an evaluation instrument that reflects local and state criteria and concerns.


	Are aligned to the content standards adopted by SBE and consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by SBE
	
	For grades K-8, only instructional materials on the list of materials adopted by SBE and/or other instructional materials that have not been adopted by SBE but are aligned with the state academic content standards or the Common Core State Standards may be recommended for selection.  (Education Code 60200, 60210)
	
	CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts offering any of grades 9-12 and may be revised to reflect district practice CDE provides standards map templates, available on its website, for reference in determining alignment of instructional materials for grades 9-12 core courses.
	For grades 9-12, instructional materials in history-social science, mathematics, English/language arts, and science shall be reviewed using a standards map in order to determine the extent to which the materials are aligned to state academic content standards.
	 
	Do not reflect adversely upon persons because of any characteristic specified in law and Board Policy 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities, nor contain any sectarian or denominational doctrine or propaganda contrary to law  (Education Code 51501, 60044)

	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 60048 and 60200 require that the Board not adopt basic instructional materials that provide unnecessary exposure to a commercial brand name, product, or corporate or company logo, unless it makes specific findings that the use has an educational purpose or is incidental to the general nature of an illustration, as provided in Item #5 below. SBE's publication, "Standards for Evaluating Instructional Materials for Social Content," details standards for the use of brand names and corporate logos in instructional materials.
	Do not expose students to a commercial brand name, product, or corporate or company logo unless the Board makes a specific finding that the use is appropriate based on one of the following:  (Education Code 60048, 60200)
	 
	
		The commercial brand name, product, or corporate or company logo is used in text for an educational purpose as defined in guidelines or frameworks adopted by SBE
		 
		The appearance of a commercial brand name, product, or corporate or company logo in an illustration is incidental to the general nature of the illustration

The complete list required by Education Code 60040, as amended by AB 1078, is reflected below.Additionally, pursuant to Education Code 60040.5, as added by AB 1078, CDE is required to issue, by July 1, 2025, guidance regarding how to review instructional materials to ensure that they represent diverse perspectives and are culturally relevant.

	CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 9517.2 sets the following maximum weight standards for each student textbook: three pounds for grades K-4, four pounds for grades 5-8, and five pounds for grades 9-12. 5 CCR 9517.2 requires publishers submitting textbooks to SBE that exceed those weight standards to provide lighter weight alternatives, such as split volumes or electronic editions, soft cover editions, or other alternate physical formats. For materials for grades 9-12, publishers must disclose the availability of lighter weight alternatives. Item #14 below includes textbook weight as one of the criteria for Board consideration.
	When available, include options for lighter weight materials, including materials in digital format, in order to help minimize any injury to students by the combined weight of instructional materials

In addition to meeting the above criteria as applicable, technology-based materials shall:


	Be both available and comparable to other, equivalent instructional materials  (Education Code 60052)
	 
	Be accessible to all students, including economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and English learners

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 60061 provides criteria and/or limitations for publishers to follow when establishing the cost of the materials being furnished; see CDE's website for a price list of adopted instructional materials. Additionally, Education Code 60071 forbids publishers from offering "valuable thing(s)" to school officials for the purpose of influencing the purchase of instructional materials.
