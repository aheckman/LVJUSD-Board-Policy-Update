## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice.
The Governing Board recognizes that private industry and the schools have a mutual interest in maximizing student achievement in order to prepare students to be productive citizens and contribute to the economic health of the community. The Board shall encourage local business involvement in efforts that support the core mission and goals of the district and promote the academic, social, and physical well-being of students.
 
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies to initiate business partnerships and shall communicate with business partners about district needs and priorities. The Superintendent or designee may assign district staff to coordinate community/business outreach efforts on behalf of the district and work to ensure equitable distribution of business involvement across all district schools.

Businesses and industry and/or their representatives may support district schools and programs by:

	Volunteering in the classroom or school, providing special instructional programs or assemblies, and serving as tutors or mentors for individual students
	
	CSBA NOTE: Education Code 41032 authorizes the Governing Board to accept gifts and to prescribe conditions for their acceptance; see BP 3290 - Gifts, Grants and Bequests.
	Donating funds, products, instructional materials, or services that serve an educational purpose
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #3 below is for use by districts that allow paid advertisement by commercial enterprises in school-sponsored publications or on school property and have set criteria for approval of such advertising; see AR 1325 - Advertising and Promotion.
	Purchasing advertisements in school-sponsored publications or on school property in accordance with law and Board policy
	 
	Serving on advisory committees in order to provide business expertise or perspectives
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #5 below is for use by districts that offer career technical education and/or work experience education programs in any of grades 7-12. Districts offering career technical education are required by Education Code 8070 to establish an advisory committee which must include business representation. 20 USC 2354 requires involvement of business representatives in the planning, development, implementation, and evaluation of career technical education programs funded by the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act; see BP/AR 6178 - Career Technical Education.
	Working with district staff to ensure the relevance and rigor of the district's career technical education program and providing work opportunities for students enrolled in these programs
	 
	Engaging in other activities approved by the Superintendent or designee that are designed to increase student learning or support school operations

The Board urges employers to further support the schools by recognizing their employees' needs as parents/guardians, accommodating their needs for child care, and supporting their involvement with their children's schools.
 
The Superintendent or designee may publicly acknowledge the support of a business partner in district communications and/or by allowing the use of the business name or logo on donated products or materials, but shall not unduly promote or endorse any commercial activity or products. He/she also may recommend Board commendation to those individuals and/or businesses that have made extraordinary contributions to the district.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board regarding the district's progress in establishing and sustaining business partnerships and the ways in which businesses have supported district programs.
