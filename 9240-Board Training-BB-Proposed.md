## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that the Board's ability to effectively and responsibly govern the District is essential to promoting student achievement, building positive community relations, and protecting the public interest in District schools. Board members shall participate in mandatory ethics training, as outlined below, and are encouraged to participate in ongoing opportunities for professional development sufficient to help them understand their responsibilities, stay abreast of new developments in education, and improve governance skills.

Unless a Board member's term expires prior to January 1, 2026, each Board member shall complete ethics training in accordance with Government Code 53234-53235.2 by January 1, 2026, and at least once every two years thereafter.  (Government Code 53235)

Once completed, the Board member shall inform the Board president and Superintendent, who shall ensure that records are retained for each Board member's participation in the required ethics training.

The Board president and/or the Superintendent or designee shall provide an orientation to newly elected or appointed Board members consistent with Board Bylaw 9230 - Orientation.

The Board president shall work with the Superintendent or designee to include funds for professional development and associated reasonable travel expenses for the Board as a whole and for each individual Board member in the District's proposed annual budget.

Individual Board members are encouraged to share the knowledge or skills acquired from individual professional development opportunities with the full Board, thereby benefiting the Board and District.

Consistent with Board Bylaw 9320 - Meetings And Notices, Board members may attend a professional development opportunity as part of a conference or similar public gathering, so long as a majority of the Board members do not discuss among themselves, other than as part of the scheduled program, business of a specified nature that is within the District's jurisdiction
