## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Article 1, Section 3 of the California Constitution grants any person the right to access information concerning meetings and writings of state and local government bodies, officials, and agencies as long as the constitutional rights of privacy and due process are protected. Courts broadly interpret rules or laws granting access and narrowly interpret those denying access; thus, the burden is on the district to demonstrate the need for restricting access to public records.The following optional administrative regulation lists those records defined as public and, in contrast, those defined as exempt and/or confidential, to which there is no public access.
This administrative regulation is a non-exhaustive list of records that may be defined as either public or exempt and/or confidential. Other records which fall into these definitions may exist and may be identified in the future.

Definitions

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 7920.530, a "public record" includes any writing that relates to district business as defined below.Emails and other electronic communications related in a substantive manner to district business are considered public records. Furthermore, in City of San Jose v. Superior Court, the California Supreme Court held that using a personal account or personal device to send, receive, or store communications regarding public business does not categorically exclude those records from disclosure upon request under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) (Government Code 7920.000 - 7930.215). The court noted that public agencies are required to disclose all applicable records that can be located "with reasonable effort," including those records contained on a public employee's or official's personal device or account. Such searches need not be extraordinarily extensive or intrusive. For further information, see CSBA's, "Legal Alert: Tips for Governing Boards in Response to Public Records Act Ruling on Electronic Communications." Also see the accompanying Board policy, AR 3580 - District Records, BP 4040 - Employee Use of Technology, and BB 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications.
Public records include any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the district's business prepared, owned, used, or retained by the district regardless of physical form or characteristics.  (Government Code 7920.530)

Writing means any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, photocopying, transmitting by electronic mail or facsimile, and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing any form of communication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols or combinations thereof, and any record thereby created, regardless of the manner in which the record has been stored.  (Government Code 7920.545)

Member of the public means any person, except a member, agent, officer, or employee of the district or a federal, state, or other local agency acting within the scope of such membership, agency, office, or employment.  (Government Code 7920.515)

Public Records

CSBA NOTE: While not specifically enumerated in Government Code 7920.530, Items #1-15 below are items which fall within the definition of "public records."
Unless otherwise exempt from disclosure, public records to which members of the public shall have access include, but are not limited to:

	Proposed and approved district budgets and annual audits  (Education Code 41020, 42103)
	 
	Statistical compilations
	 
	Reports and memoranda
	 
	Notices and bulletins
	 
	Minutes of public meetings  (Education Code 35145)
	 
	Meeting agendas  (Government Code 54957.5)
	 
	Official communications between the district and other government agencies
	
	CSBA NOTE: District and school plans (e.g., local control and accountability plan, school plan for student achievement, comprehensive safety plan) must generally be accessible to the public. However, pursuant to Education Code 32281, the Governing Board may choose to prohibit disclosure of those portions of the comprehensive safety plan that include tactical responses to criminal incidents that may result in death or serious bodily injury at the school site. See BP 0450 - Comprehensive Safety Plan.
	District and school plans, and the information and data relevant to the development and evaluation of such plans, unless otherwise prohibited by law
	 
	Initial proposals of exclusive employee representatives and of the district, once presented at a district Governing Board meeting  (Government Code 3547)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Government Code 7927.200 exempts from disclosure those records pertaining to pending litigation until the pending litigation or claim has been finally adjudicated or otherwise settled. However, the Attorney General opined in 71 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 235 (1988) that certain records predating the filing of a lawsuit are subject to disclosure. In Fairley v. Superior Court, a California Court of Appeal concurred and held that documents were exempted only if they were prepared for use in litigation. See Item #2 in "Exempt and Confidential Public Records", below. It is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel with questions regarding disclosure of documents related to litigation.
	Records pertaining to claims and litigation against the district which have been adjudicated or settled  (Government Code 7927.200, 7927.205)
	 
	Statements of economic interests required by the Conflict of Interest Code  (Government Code 81008)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Generally, the names and salaries of public employees are subject to disclosure under the CPRA. In Sacramento County Employees Retirement System v. Superior Court, a California Court of Appeal held that the names and corresponding pension benefits of members of a county retirement system are subject to disclosure and are not considered "individual records of members" protected by Government Code 31532. However, in International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers v. The Superior Court of Alameda County, the California Supreme Court recognized that, in some instances, the salaries of certain employees might be exempt from disclosure, depending on the facts and circumstances. It is recommended that districts with questions about the disclosure of employee information consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
	Documents containing names, salaries, and pension benefits of district employees
	 
	Employment contracts and settlement agreements  (Government Code 53262)
	 
	Instructional materials including, but not limited to, textbooks  (Education Code 49091.10)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 7928.801, any executed contract for the purchase of goods or services by the district, including the price and terms of payment, is a public record subject to disclosure under the CPRA. It is recommended that districts with questions about contracting with entities for goods or services outside of California, or pursuant to federal law, consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
	Executed contracts for the purchase of goods or services, even if the contract contains provisions specifying that the contract is confidential or a proprietary record of the vendor  (Government Code 7928.801)

Access to public records of the district shall be granted to Board members on the same basis as any other member of the public. When Board members are authorized to access public records in the administration of their duties, the Superintendent or designee shall not discriminate among any of the Board members as to which record, or portion of the record, will be made available, or when it will be made available.  (Government Code 7921.305, 7921.310)

Exempt and Confidential Public Records

Records exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) include, but are not limited to:

	Preliminary drafts, notes, and interagency or intradistrict memoranda that are not retained by the district in the ordinary course of business, provided that the public interest in withholding these records clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure  (Government Code 7927.500)
	 
	Records specifically generated in connection with or prepared for use in litigation to which the district is a party or to respond to claims made against the district pursuant to the Tort Claims Act, until the litigation or claim has been finally adjudicated or otherwise settled, or beyond, if the records are protected by some other provision of law  (Government Code 7927.200, 7927.205)
	
	CSBA NOTE: The Safe at Home address confidentiality program has been in existence pursuant to Government Code 6205-6210 and 6215-6216 to protect victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, and elder or dependent adult abuse, and members of their households, as well as district employees who face threats of violence, or violence or harassment from the public because of the employee's work for the district. This type of protection has been extended to district employees and Board members who face threats of violence, or violence or harassment from the public because of the employee's work for the district, and, pursuant to Government Code 6205-6210, to victims of child abduction and members of their households. Government Code 6207 provides that, when creating a public record, the district may not include actual residences of students, parents/guardians, or employees when a substitute address is designated through the Safe at Home program. Districts are required to accept the program participation card issued by the Secretary of State and to substitute a post office box as the participant's address.
	Personnel records, medical records, or similar materials, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy  (Government Code 7927.700)
	
	The home addresses, home telephone numbers, personal cell phone numbers, or birth date of employees shall only be disclosed as follows:  (Government Code 7928.300)
	 
	
		To an agent or a family member of the employee
		 
		To an officer or employee of a state agency or another school district or county office of education when necessary for the performance of official duties
		 
		To an employee organization pursuant to regulations and decisions of the Public Employment Relations Board, except that the home address and any telephone number for an employee who performs law enforcement-related functions, or the birth date of any employee, shall not be disclosed
		 
		Upon written request of any employee, the district shall not disclose the employee's home address, home telephone number, personal cell phone number, personal email address, or birth date, and the district shall remove the home address, home telephone number, and personal cell phone number from any mailing list of the district except a list used exclusively to contact the employee
		 
		To an agent or employee of a health benefit plan providing health services or administering claims for health services to district employees and their enrolled dependents, for the purpose of providing the health services or administering claims for employees and their enrolled dependents
		
		CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 7928.205, as amended by AB 1785 (Ch. 551, Statutes of 2024), the district is prohibited from publicly posting online the information specified below of any elected or appointed official, such as a Board member, without first obtaining the written permission of that individual.
	
	
	The home address, telephone number, or both the name and assessor parcel number associated with the home address of any elected or appointed official posted by the district online without first obtaining the written permission of that individual  (Government Code 7928.205)
	 
	Student records, except directory information and other records to the extent permitted by law and district policy  (Education Code 49073, 49076; 20 USC 1232g; 34 CFR 99.1-99.8)
	 
	Test questions, scoring keys, and other examination data except as provided by law  (Government Code 7929.605)
	 
	Without affecting the law of eminent domain, the contents of real estate appraisals or engineering or feasibility estimates and evaluations made for or by the district relative to the acquisition of property, or to prospective public supply and construction contracts, until all of the property has been acquired or all of the contract agreement obtained  (Government Code 7928.705)
	 
	Information required from any taxpayer in connection with the collection of local taxes that is received in confidence and the disclosure of the information to other persons would result in an unfair competitive disadvantage to the person supplying the information  (Government Code 7925.000)
	 
	Library circulation and patron use records of a borrower or patron including, but not limited to, name, address, telephone number, email address, borrowing information, or use of library information resources, except when disclosure is to persons acting within the scope of their duties in the administration of the library; to persons authorized in writing, by the individual to whom the records pertain, to inspect the records; or by court order  (Government Code 7927.100, 7927.105)
	
	CSBA NOTE: The following exemption protects attorney-client privileged communications and attorney work product, as well as other work product prepared for use in pending litigation or claims. Pursuant to the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of California, when an attorney has been hired to represent the district as a whole, this privilege may only be waived by the Board.In Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors v. Superior Court, the California Supreme Court held that invoices for the services of district counsel, or portions of those invoices, may be privileged and therefore exempt from disclosure. It is recommended that districts with questions about disclosable records in response to a CPRA request for legal invoices consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
	Records for which the disclosure is exempted or prohibited pursuant to state or federal law, including, but not limited to, provisions of the Evidence Code relating to privilege (Government Code 7927.705)
	 
	Documents prepared by or for the district to assess its vulnerability to terrorist attack or other criminal acts intended to disrupt district operations and that are for distribution or consideration in closed session  (Government Code 7929.200)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #12 is related to the information technology security of the district. Government Code 11549.3, authorizes districts, at district expense, to request the Military Department, in consultation with the California Cybersecurity Integration Center, to perform an independent security assessment of the district or individual district school. During the process of conducting an independent security assessment pursuant to Government Code 11549.3, information and records concerning the independent security assessment are confidential and are not disclosable.
	Information security record if disclosure of that record would reveal vulnerabilities to, or otherwise increase the potential for an attack on, an information technology system of the district  (Government Code 7929.210)
	 
	Recall petitions, petitions for special elections to fill Board vacancies, or petitions for the reorganization of the school district  (Government Code 7924.110)
	 
	Minutes of Board meetings held in closed session  (Government Code 54957.2)
	 
	Computer software developed by the district  (Government Code 7922.585)
	 
	Records that contain individually identifiable health information, including records that may be exempt pursuant to physician-patient privilege, the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  (Government Code 7926.400, 7930.000-7930.215)
	 
	Any other records listed as exempt from public disclosure in the CPRA or other statutes
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #18 below reflects an exemption often referred to as the "catch-all" or "public interest" exemption pursuant to Government Code 7922.000. This exemption allows a district to withhold a record based on analysis of the specific facts of the situation and in light of the competing public interests. This exemption also includes the "deliberative process privilege" which is designed to protect a district's decision-making process in order to encourage candid discussions within the district. It is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel when determining whether a request for a record falls under this exemption.
	Any other records for which the district can demonstrate that, based on the particular facts of the case, the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record  (Government Code 7922.000)

When disclosing to a member of the public any record that contains personal information, including, but not limited to, an employee's home address, home telephone number, social security number, personal cell phone number, or birth date, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that such personal information is redacted from that record.  (Government Code 7922.200, 7928.300)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 234.7 prohibits the collection of information or documents regarding the citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members. If the district becomes aware of the citizenship or immigration status of any student, it is prohibited from disclosing that information, as such disclosure is not among the limited exceptions specified in law for which student records may be released without parent/guardian consent or a lawful judicial subpoena/warrant. See BP/AR 5125 - Student Records and BP/AR 5145.13 - Response to Immigration Enforcement.Additionally, pursuant to Government Code 8310.3, districts are prohibited from collecting or disclosing to federal government authorities any personal information regarding an individual's religious beliefs, practices, or affiliation for the purpose of compiling a list, registry, or database of individuals based on religious affiliation, national origin, or ethnicity.
Unless otherwise authorized or required by law, information regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status or religious beliefs, practices, or affiliation shall not be disclosed.  (Education Code 234.7; Government Code 8310.3)

Inspection of Records, Requests for Copies, and Recovery of Costs

CSBA NOTE: In Los Angeles Times v. Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, a California Court of Appeal held that the CPRA does not require written requests and therefore a public record request may be made orally, by phone, or in writing, including by email, fax, or hand delivery. The district may ask, but not require, that the person put an oral request in writing.
Any person may request a copy or inspection of any district record that is not exempt from disclosure.  (Government Code 7922.530)

Within 10 days of receiving any request to inspect or copy a district record, the Superintendent or designee shall determine whether the request seeks release of a disclosable public record in the district's possession. The Superintendent or designee shall promptly inform the person making the request of the determination and the reasons for the decision.  (Government Code 7922.535)

In unusual circumstances, the Superintendent or designee may extend the 10-day limit for up to 14 days by providing written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be made. Unusual circumstances include the following, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to properly process the request:  (Government Code 7922.535)

	The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request
	 
	The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request
	 
	The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency (e.g., a state agency or city) having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the district (e.g., two different school sites) with substantial interest in the request
	 
	In the case of electronic records, the need to compile data, write programming language or a computer program, or construct a computer report to extract data
	
	CSBA NOTE: In an effort to balance the right of the public to access public records in a timely manner while affording districts adequate opportunity to satisfy information requests during a state of emergency proclaimed pursuant to the California Emergency Services Act (Government Code 8550-8669.7), Government Code 7922.535, as amended by SB 1034 (Ch. 161, Statutes of 2024), includes, in the definition of "unusual circumstances," the need to search for, collect, and examine records due to the state of emergency.
	The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine records during a state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor pursuant to the California Emergency Services Act in the jurisdiction where the district is located when the state of emergency currently affects, due to the state of emergency, the district's ability to timely respond to staffing shortages or closure of facilities where the requested records are located  (Government Code 8567)

If the Superintendent or designee determines that the request seeks disclosable public records, the determination shall state the estimated date and time when the records will be made available.  (Government Code 7922.535)

Public records shall be open to inspection at all times during district office hours. If a portion of the requested record(s) is exempt from disclosure, any non-exempt, reasonably segregable portion of the record shall be made available for inspection after deletion of the portions exempted by law.  (Government Code 7922.525)

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 7922.530 states that copies of records must be provided "promptly." The term "promptly" is not defined in law, but Government Code 7922.500 also states that a district may not delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of records. Thus, if the records are held in a manner that allows for prompt disclosure, the records generally should not be withheld because of the 10-day response period or the 14-day extension detailed above.
Upon request for a copy that reasonably describes an identifiable, non-exempt record, an exact copy shall be promptly provided unless it is impracticable to do so.  (Government Code 7922.530)

If only a portion of the identified record is exempt from disclosure, the record's exempt material shall be redacted prior to disclosure.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that charge for copies. See the accompanying Board policy.Government Code 7922.530 permits, but does not require, the district to charge a person requesting a physical copy of a record a fee covering the direct costs of duplication; however, no fee may be charged to a person who wishes to inspect but not copy a record. In North County Parents Organization for Children with Special Needs v. Department of Education, the court determined that direct costs include only the cost of running the copy machine and possibly the expense of the person operating it. Examples of costs that do not fit this definition include costs associated with searching, reviewing, or redacting the record; assisting the requester in formulating the request; responding to the request; or employee time to sit with the requester during inspection of the record.Pursuant to Government Code 7922.530, members of the public who request to inspect a disclosable record of the district have the right to use their own equipment on district premises, without being charged any fees or costs, to photograph, copy, or reproduce the record in a manner that does not require the equipment to make physical contact with the record.Additionally, Government Code 7922.575 allows recovery of direct costs when the district would be required to produce a copy of an electronic record and the record is one that is produced only at otherwise regularly scheduled intervals or requires data compilation, extraction, or programming to produce the record. In National Lawyers Guild, San Francisco Bay Area Chapter v. City of Hayward, the California Supreme Court clarified that the term "data extraction" does not include the process of redacting exempt material from otherwise disclosable electronic records and that a public agency may not recover costs for the compilation or redaction of video footage.Due to the complex nature of cost recovery standards under the CPRA it is recommended that districts with questions regarding the permissibility of fees consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.
The Superintendent or designee shall charge an amount for copies that reflects the direct costs of duplication in accordance with law. Written requests to waive the fee shall be submitted to the Superintendent or designee.

Without charging any fees or costs, the Superintendent or designee shall allow members of the public to use their own equipment on district premises to photograph or otherwise copy or reproduce a disclosable record as long as the means of copy or reproduction:  (Government Code 7922.530)

	Do not require the equipment to make physical contact with the record
	 
	Will not result in damage to the record
	 
	Will not result in unauthorized access to the district's computer systems or secured networks by using software, equipment, or any other technology capable of accessing, altering, or compromising the district's electronic records

The Superintendent or designee may impose any reasonable limit on the use of personal equipment to photograph, copy, or reproduce a disclosable record that is necessary to protect the safety of the records, or to prevent the copying of records from being an unreasonable burden to the orderly function of the district and its employees. The Superintendent or designee may also impose any limit that is necessary to maintain the integrity of, or ensure the long-term preservation of, historic or high-value records.  (Government Code 7922.530)

In addition to maintaining public records for public inspection during district office hours, the district may comply with public records requests by posting any public record on the district's website and, in response to a public records request, directing the member of the public to the location on the website where the record can be found. However, if the member of the public is unable to access or reproduce the record from the website, the district shall promptly provide an exact copy of the public record upon payment of duplication fees, if applicable, unless it is impracticable to provide an exact copy.  (Government Code 7922.545)

If any person requests that a public record be provided in an electronic format, the district shall make that record available in any electronic format in which it holds the information. The district shall provide a copy of the electronic record in the format requested as long as the requested format is one that has been used by the district to create copies for its own use or for use by other agencies.  (Government Code 7922.570)

The cost of duplicating an electronic record shall be limited to the direct cost of producing a copy of the record in electronic format. However, the requester shall bear the cost of producing the copy of the electronic record, including the cost to construct the record and the cost of programming and computer services necessary to produce the copy, under the following circumstances:  (Government Code 7922.575)

	The electronic record is one that is produced only at otherwise regularly scheduled intervals
	 
	The request would require data compilation, extraction, or programming to produce the record

Assistance in Identifying Requested Records

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 7922.600 requires the district to assist a person requesting to inspect or obtain a copy of a public record as specified below. Pursuant to Government Code 7922.605, this assistance is not required if the district grants the request and the records are made available or if the request is denied on the grounds that the records are confidential as specified in Government Code 7920.505.
If the Superintendent or designee denies a request for disclosable records, the requester shall be assisted in making a focused and effective request that reasonably describes an identifiable record. To the extent reasonable under the circumstances, the Superintendent or designee shall do all of the following:  (Government Code 7922.600)

	Assist in identifying records and information responsive to the request or the purpose of the request, if specified
	
	If, after making a reasonable effort to elicit additional clarifying information from the requester to help identify the record, the Superintendent or designee is still unable to identify the information, this requirement shall be deemed satisfied.
	 
	Describe the information technology and physical location in which the records exist
	 
	Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records or information sought

Provisions of the CPRA shall not be construed so as to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of public records. Any notification denying a request for public records shall state the name and title of each person responsible for the denial.  (Government Code 7922.500, 7922.540)

<div id='zNQ324' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 7920.530, a "public record" includes any writing that relates to district business as defined below.<br><br>Emails and other electronic communications related in a substantive manner to district business are considered public records. Furthermore, in City of San Jose v. Superior Court, the California Supreme Court held that using a personal account or personal device to send, receive, or store communications regarding public business does not categorically exclude those records from disclosure upon request under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) (Government Code 7920.000 - 7930.215). The court noted that public agencies are required to disclose all applicable records that can be located "with reasonable effort," including those records contained on a public employee's or official's personal device or account. Such searches need not be extraordinarily extensive or intrusive.

<div id='AOQ339' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that charge for copies. See the accompanying Board policy.<br><br>Government Code 7922.530 permits, but does not require, the district to charge a person requesting a physical copy of a record a fee covering the direct costs of duplication; however, no fee may be charged to a person who wishes to inspect but not copy a record. In North County Parents Organization for Children with Special Needs v. Department of Education, the court determined that direct costs include only the cost of running the copy machine and possibly the expense of the person operating it. Examples of costs that do not fit this definition include costs associated with searching, reviewing, or redacting the record; assisting the requester in formulating the request; responding to the request; or employee time to sit with the requester during inspection of the record.<br><br>Pursuant to Government Code 7922.530, members of the public who request to inspect a disclosable record of the district have the right to use their own equipment on district premises, without being charged any fees or costs, to photograph, copy, or reproduce the record in a manner that does not require the equipment to make physical contact with the record.<br><br>Additionally, Government Code 7922.575 allows recovery of direct costs when the district would be required to produce a copy of an electronic record and the record is one that is produced only at otherwise regularly scheduled intervals or requires data compilation, extraction, or programming to produce the record. In National Lawyers Guild, San Francisco Bay Area Chapter v. City of Hayward, the California Supreme Court clarified that the term "data extraction" does not include the process of redacting exempt material from otherwise disclosable electronic records and that a public agency may not recover costs for the compilation or redaction of video footage.<br><br>Due to the complex nature of cost recovery standards under the CPRA it is recommended that districts with questions regarding the permissibility of fees consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MTIwNA23" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MTIwNA23%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22AOQ339%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1741732054%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20following%20optional%20paragraph%20is%20for%20use%20by%20districts%20that%20charge%20for%20copies.%20See%20the%20accompanying%20Board%20policy.%5Cn%5CnGovernment%20Code%207922.530%20permits%2C%20but%20does%20not%20require%2C%20the%20district%20to%20charge%20a%20person%20requesting%20a%20physical%20copy%20of%20a%20record%20a%20fee%20covering%20the%20direct%20costs%20of%20duplication%3B%20however%2C%20no%20fee%20may%20be%20charged%20to%20a%20person%20who%20wishes%20to%20inspect%20but%20not%20copy%20a%20record.%20In%20North%20County%20Parents%20Organization%20for%20Children%20with%20Special%20Needs%20v.%20Department%20of%20Education%2C%20the%20court%20determined%20that%20direct%20costs%20include%20only%20the%20cost%20of%20running%20the%20copy%20machine%20and%20possibly%20the%20expense%20of%20the%20person%20operating%20it.%20Examples%20of%20costs%20that%20do%20not%20fit%20this%20definition%20include%20costs%20associated%20with%20searching%2C%20reviewing%2C%20or%20redacting%20the%20record%3B%20assisting%20the%20requester%20in%20formulating%20the%20request%3B%20responding%20to%20the%20request%3B%20or%20employee%20time%20to%20sit%20with%20the%20requester%20during%20inspection%20of%20the%20record.%5Cn%5CnPursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%207922.530%2C%20members%20of%20the%20public%20who%20request%20to%20inspect%20a%20disclosable%20record%20of%20the%20district%20have%20the%20right%20to%20use%20their%20own%20equipment%20on%20district%20premises%2C%20without%20being%20charged%20any%20fees%20or%20costs%2C%20to%20photograph%2C%20copy%2C%20or%20reproduce%20the%20record%20in%20a%20manner%20that%20does%20not%20require%20the%20equipment%20to%20make%20physical%20contact%20with%20the%20record.%5Cn%5CnAdditionally%2C%20Government%20Code%207922.575%20allows%20recovery%20of%20direct%20costs%20when%20the%20district%20would%20be%20required%20to%20produce%20a%20copy%20of%20an%20electronic%20record%20and%20the%20record%20is%20one%20that%20is%20produced%20only%20at%20otherwise%20regularly%20scheduled%20intervals%20or%20requires%20data%20compilation%2C%20extraction%2C%20or%20programming%20to%20produce%20the%20record.%20In%20National%20Lawyers%20Guild%2C%20San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area%20Chapter%20v.%20City%20of%20Hayward%2C%20the%20California%20Supreme%20Court%20clarified%20that%20the%20term%20%5C%22data%20extraction%5C%22%20does%20not%20include%20the%20process%20of%20redacting%20exempt%20material%20from%20otherwise%20disclosable%20electronic%20records%20and%20that%20a%20public%20agency%20may%20not%20recover%20costs%20for%20the%20compilation%20or%20redaction%20of%20video%20footage.%5Cn%5CnDue%20to%20the%20complex%20nature%20of%20cost%20recovery%20standards%20under%20the%20CPRA%20it%20is%20recommended%20that%20districts%20with%20questions%20regarding%20the%20permissibility%20of%20fees%20consult%20CSBA%27s%20District%20and%20County%20Office%20of%20Education%20Legal%20Services%20or%20district%20legal%20counsel.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-selected="true" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MTIwNA23" title="CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
The Superintendent or designee shall charge an amount for copies that reflects the direct costs of duplication in accordance with law. Written requests to waive the fee shall be submitted to the Superintendent or designee.<br>
<br>
Without charging any fees or costs, the Superintendent or designee shall allow members of the public to use their own equipment on district premises to photograph or otherwise copy or reproduce a disclosable record as long as the means of copy or reproduction:&nbsp; (Government Code 7922.530)
<ol>
	<li>Do not require the equipment to make physical contact with the record<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Will not result in damage to the record<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Will not result in unauthorized access to the district&#39;s computer systems or secured networks by using software, equipment, or any other technology capable of accessing, altering, or compromising the district&#39;s electronic records</li>
</ol>
The Superintendent or designee may impose any reasonable limit on the use of personal equipment to photograph, copy, or reproduce a disclosable record that is necessary to protect the safety of the records, or to prevent the copying of records from being an unreasonable burden to the orderly function of the district and its employees. The Superintendent or designee may also impose any limit that is necessary to maintain the integrity of, or ensure the long-term preservation of, historic or high-value records.&nbsp; (Government Code 7922.530)<br>
<br>
In addition to maintaining public records for public inspection during district office hours, the district may comply with public records requests by posting any public record on the district&#39;s website and, in response to a public records request, directing the member of the public to the location on the website where the record can be found. However, if the member of the public is unable to access or reproduce the record from the website, the district shall promptly provide an exact copy of the public record upon payment of duplication fees, if applicable, unless it is impracticable to provide an exact copy.&nbsp; (Government Code 7922.545)<br>
<br>
If any person requests that a public record be provided in an electronic format, the district shall make that record available in any electronic format in which it holds the information. The district shall provide a copy of the electronic record in the format requested as long as the requested format is one that has been used by the district to create copies for its own use or for use by other agencies.&nbsp; (Government Code 7922.570)<br>
<br>
The cost of duplicating an electronic record shall be limited to the direct cost of producing a copy of the record in electronic format. However, the requester shall bear the cost of producing the copy of the electronic record, including the cost to construct the record and the cost of programming and computer services necessary to produce the copy, under the following circumstances:&nbsp; (Government Code 7922.575)
<ol>
	<li>The electronic record is one that is produced only at otherwise regularly scheduled intervals<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The request would require data compilation, extraction, or programming to produce the record</li>
