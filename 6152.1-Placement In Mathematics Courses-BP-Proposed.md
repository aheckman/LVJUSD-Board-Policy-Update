## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that a sound educational program must include the study of subjects that prepare students for admission to higher education and/or fulfilling careers. District students shall be provided an opportunity to complete a sequence of mathematics courses recommended for admission into the University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) systems.

The District shall offer alternative pathways of courses designed in a manner that provides maximum opportunities for students to access advanced mathematics courses during high school.

The Superintendent or designee shall work with District teachers, counselors, and administrators and the representatives of feeder schools to develop a well-articulated sequence of mathematics courses and consistent protocols for placing students in mathematics courses offered at District high schools.

Such placement protocols shall systematically take into consideration multiple objective academic measures that may include, but are not limited to, statewide mathematics assessments, including state interim and summative assessments; placement tests that are aligned to state-adopted content standards in mathematics; classroom assignment and grades; and report cards.  (Education Code 51224.7)

District staff shall implement the placement protocols uniformly and without regard to students' socioeconomic background or any characteristic specified in Board Policy 0410 - Nondiscrimination In District Programs And Activities, including, but not limited to, race, sex, gender, nationality, and ethnicity.

The placement protocols shall provide for at least one reevaluation within the first month of the school year to ensure that students are appropriately placed in mathematics courses and shall specify the criteria the District will use to make this determination. Any student found to be misplaced shall be promptly placed in the appropriate mathematics course.

If a student or parent/guardian questions the student's placement, the student or the student's parent/guardian may appeal the decision to the Superintendent or designee. The decision of the Superintendent or designee shall be final.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all teachers, counselors, and other District staff responsible for determining students' placement in mathematics courses receive training on the placement protocols.

The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall annually review student data related to placement in mathematics courses offered at District high schools to ensure that students who are qualified to progress in mathematics courses based on their performance on objective academic measures are not being held back in a disproportionate manner on the basis of any subjective or discriminatory basis, and shall develop strategies for removing any identified barriers to students' access to mathematics courses. The Superintendent or designee shall also report on the percentage of District students who have successfully completed mathematics courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the UC and CSU systems.
