## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48232 and 48416, the Governing Board is mandated to adopt policy if it wishes to allow student leaves of absence for students age 15 or higher, or continuation education students ages 16-18, under the conditions described in the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Governing Board recognizes the importance of regular school attendance in promoting student achievement.  However, the Board also recognizes that, in rare circumstances, it may be beneficial for a student to participate in opportunities outside the school which contribute to his/her educational experience.

The Superintendent or designee may grant student leaves of absence for the purpose of supervised travel, study, training, or work not available to the student under another educational option.  Such leave may be granted to a student 15 years of age or older in the regular program and to a student age 16-18 in the continuation education program. (Education Code 48232, 48416)

No more than one percent of the students enrolled and attending a school shall be granted a leave of absence during any school year.  (Education Code 48232, 48416)

When feasible, students shall be encouraged to instead enroll in the district's independent study program to allow for greater contact and coordination with district staff.
