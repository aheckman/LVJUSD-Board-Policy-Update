## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3543.2, safety conditions in employment are a mandatory subject of collective bargaining. The following Board policy and accompanying administrative regulation may be revised to reflect district practice and the terms of the district's collective bargaining agreements.
The Governing Board desires to provide a safe and orderly work environment for all employees. As part of the district's comprehensive safety plan, the Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for protecting employees from potentially dangerous persons and situations and for providing necessary assistance and support when emergency situations occur.

Any person who threatens the safety of others at any district facility may be removed by the Superintendent or designee in accordance with Administrative Regulation 3515.2 - Disruptions.

CSBA NOTE:  Code of Civil Procedure 527.8 authorizes districts to seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) on behalf of employees who have been subjected to harassment, unlawful violence, or a credible threat of violence in the workplace. A collective bargaining representative may also seek a TRO on behalf of a district employee if the collective bargaining representative serves that employee in employment or labor matters at the employee's workplace. Before filing a petition for a TRO, the district or collective bargaining representative is required to provide the employee who suffered unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence an opportunity to decline to be named in the TRO. If such a denial occurs, the district or collective bargaining representative is not prohibited from seeking a TRO on behalf of other employees at the workplace, and, if appropriate, other employees at other workplaces in the district.Pursuant to Penal Code 18150 and 18170, a gun violence restraining order prohibiting a person from owning, having custody or control of, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm or ammunition may be petitioned by that person's employer, a coworker who has had substantial and regular interactions with the person for at least one year and has the employer's approval, or an employee or teacher of a secondary school that the person has attended in the past six months if the employee or teacher has obtained the approval or a school administrator or designee.
Any employee against whom harassment, violence, or any threat of violence has been directed in the workplace shall notify the Superintendent or designee immediately. As appropriate, the Superintendent or designee shall initiate legal and security measures to protect the employee and others in the workplace. Such measures may include seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) on behalf of the employee pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 527.8 and/or a gun violence restraining order pursuant to Penal Code 18150 and 18170.

Additionally, a collective bargaining representative may seek a TRO on behalf of a district employee against whom harassment, violence, or credible threat of violence has been directed in the workplace, if the collective bargaining representative serves that employee in employment or labor matters at the employee's workplace.  (Code of Civil Procedure 527.8)

Upon request by an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the Superintendent or designee shall provide reasonable accommodations in accordance with Government Code 12945.8 and the accompanying administrative regulation to protect the employee's safety while at work.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48904 and 48905, an employee who is injured or whose property is damaged by willful misconduct of a district student under the conditions described below may request that the district pursue legal action against the student or the student's parent/guardian. For more information regarding recovery for damages when an employee is injured or whose property is damaged by the willful misconduct of a district student, see BP 3515.4 - Recovery for Property Loss or Damage and AR 5125.2 - Withholding Grades, Diploma or Transcripts. It is recommended that the district consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel when considering whether to pursue legal action.
The Superintendent or designee may pursue legal action on behalf of an employee against a student or the student's parent/guardian to recover damages for injury to the employee's person or property caused by the student's willful misconduct that occurred on district property, at a school or district activity, or in retaliation for lawful acts of the employee in the performance of the employee's duties.  (Education Code 48904, 48905)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 32289.6, as added by AB 1858 (Ch. 530, Statutes of 2024), on or before June 15, 2025, the California Department of Education is required to curate and post on its website best practices pertaining to school shooter or other armed assailant drills, with which districts are encouraged to comply.Additionally, the 2024, "Executive Order on Combating Emerging Firearms Threats and Improving School-Based Active-Shooter Drills," 89 Fed. Reg. 80345, establishes an interagency Emerging Firearms Threats Task Force and requires the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Homeland Security to release guidance related to school-based active-shooter drills for schools.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide staff development in crisis prevention and intervention techniques, which may include training in classroom management, effective communication techniques, procedures for responding to an active shooter situation, and crisis resolution.

In accordance with law, the Superintendent or designee shall inform teachers, administrators, and/or counselors of crimes and offenses committed by students who may pose a danger in the classroom.  (Education Code 48201, 49079; Welfare and Institutions Code 827)

The Superintendent or designee may make available at appropriate locations, including, but not limited to, district and school offices, gyms, and classrooms, communication devices that would enable two-way communication with law enforcement and others when emergencies occur.

Use of Pepper Spray

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice. Penal Code 22810 authorizes adults, with certain exceptions, to carry an approved tear gas weapon such as pepper spray for purposes of self-defense. Penal Code 626.9 and 626.10, which prohibit the possession of weapons on school grounds, do not prohibit the possession of pepper spray on school grounds. Thus, the Governing Board may determine whether to allow or disallow, with certain exceptions, the possession of pepper spray on school property or at school activities. See the accompanying administrative regulation for related procedures. It is recommended that districts allowing employees to carry pepper spray consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district counsel regarding potential liability related to an employee's possession of pepper spray and revise the corresponding regulation accordingly.
Employees shall not carry or possess pepper spray on school property or at school activities, except when authorized by the Superintendent or designee for self-defense purposes. When allowed, an employee may only possess pepper spray in accordance with Board policy, administrative regulation, and Penal Code 22810. Any employee authorized to carry or possess pepper spray on school property who is negligent or careless in the possession or handling of pepper spray is acting outside of the scope of employment and shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary measures.

Reporting of Injurious Objects

CSBA NOTE: The following section is consistent with the actions described in AR 5131.7 - Weapons and Dangerous Instruments related to student possession.Pursuant to Education Code 49334, a school employee who initially notifies law enforcement regarding a student or adult who is in possession of an injurious object while on school grounds or under the authority of school personnel cannot be subject to any civil or administrative proceeding, including disciplinary action, for violation of any district policy or procedure related to the notification of a law enforcement agency. Education Code 49334 requires such an employee to conform with district procedures after exercising the option to notify a law enforcement agency.
Employees shall take immediate action upon being made aware that any person is in possession of a weapon or unauthorized injurious object on district property or at a district related or school-sponsored activity. Employees shall exercise their best judgment as to the potential danger involved and do one of the following:

	Confiscate the object and deliver it to the principal immediately
	 
	Immediately notify the principal or supervisor, who shall take appropriate action
	 
	Immediately call 911 and the principal or supervisor

When informing the principal about the possession or seizure of a weapon or dangerous device, an employee shall report the name(s) of persons involved, witnesses, location, and the circumstances of any seizure.
