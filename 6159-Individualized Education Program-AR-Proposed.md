	For a student with low incidence disabilities, specialized services, materials, and equipment consistent with the guidelines pursuant to Education Code 56136

To assist a student who is blind, has low vision, or is visually impaired to achieve the student's maximum potential, the IEP team may consider instruction in the expanded core curriculum, including compensatory skills such as Braille, concept development, or other skills needed to access the core curriculum; orientation and mobility; social interaction skills; career technical education; assistive technology, including optical devices; independent living skills; recreation and leisure; self-determination; and sensory efficiency. When appropriate, such services may be offered before or after school.  (Education Code 56353)

Development of the IEP

Within 30 days of a determination that a student needs special education and related services, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a meeting to develop an initial IEP is conducted.  (Education Code 56043; 34 CFR 300.323)

Any IEP required as a result of an assessment of a student shall be developed within 60 days from the date of receipt of the parent/guardian's written consent for assessment, unless the parent/guardian agrees, in writing, to an extension. Days between the student's regular school sessions, terms, or vacation of more than five school days shall not be counted. In the case of school vacations, the 60-day time limit shall recommence on the date that the student's school days reconvene.  (Education Code 56043, 56344)

However, when the IEP is required as a result of an assessment of a student for whom a referral has been made 30 days or less prior to the end of the preceding regular school year, the IEP shall be developed within 30 days after the commencement of the subsequent regular school year.  (Education Code 56344)

In developing the IEP, the IEP team shall consider all of the following:  (Education Code 56040.6, 56341.1, 56345; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.324)

	The strengths of the student
	 
	The concerns of the parents/guardians for enhancing the education of their child
	 
	The results of the initial or most recent assessment of the student
	 
	The academic, developmental, and functional needs of the student
	 
	In the case of a student whose behavior impedes the student's learning or that of others, the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports and other strategies to address that behavior
	 
	In the case of a student with limited English proficiency, the language needs of the student as such needs relate to the student's IEP
	 
	In the case of a student who is blind or visually impaired, the need to provide for instruction in Braille and instruction in the use of Braille
	
	However, such instruction need not be included in the IEP if the IEP team determines that instruction in Braille or the use of Braille is not appropriate for the student. This determination shall be based upon an assessment of the student's reading and writing skills, needs, and appropriate reading and writing media, including an assessment of future needs for instruction in Braille or the use of Braille.
	 
	The communication needs of the student and, in the case of a student who is deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind, the student's language and communication needs, opportunities for direct communications with peers and professional personnel in the student's language and communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct instruction in the student's language and communication mode
	
	The team shall also consider placements, related services, and program options that provide the student with an equal opportunity for communication access, as described in Education Code 56345.
	 
	Whether the student requires assistive technology devices and services, including artificial intelligence devices and services

If, in considering the special factors in Items #1-9 above, the IEP team determines that the student needs a particular device or service, including an intervention, accommodation, or other program modification, in order to receive FAPE, the team shall include a statement to that effect in the student's IEP.  (Education Code 56341.1)

Provision of Special Education and Related Services

The District shall ensure that, as soon as possible following development of the IEP, special education and related services are made available to the student in accordance with the IEP.  (Education Code 56344; 34 CFR 300.323)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the student's IEP is accessible to each general education teacher, special education teacher, related service provider, and any other service provider who is responsible for its implementation. The Superintendent or designee also shall ensure that such teachers and providers are informed of their specific responsibilities related to implementing the IEP and the specific accommodations, modifications, and supports that must be provided to the student in accordance with the IEP.  (34 CFR 300.323)

If an orientation and mobility evaluation is determined to be needed for a student who is blind, has low vision, or is visually impaired, the evaluation shall be conducted by a person who is appropriately certified as an orientation and mobility specialist and shall occur in familiar and unfamiliar environments, in varying lighting conditions, and in the home, school, and community, as appropriate. The Superintendent or designee may require annual written parent/guardian consent to provide orientation and mobility services when such services are provided before or after school and when they are provided away from the school site.  (Education Code 56354; 5 CCR 3051.3)

If a student's IEP requires the provision of assistive technology devices or services, including artificial intelligence services, the District shall provide such devices or services and shall, on a case-by-case basis, provide for the use of school-purchased devices or services in the student's home or other settings if the IEP team determines that the student needs access to those devices or services in order to receive FAPE. If a student who requires the use of an assistive technology device or services transfers to another local educational agency, the District shall provide the student with continued access to that device or services or a comparable device or service for two months from the date the student ceased to be enrolled in the District or until alternative arrangements can be made to provide access to the device, whichever occurs first.  (Education Code 56040.3; 34 CFR 300.105)

Review and Revision of the IEP

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the IEP team reviews the IEP periodically, but at least annually, in order to:  (Education Code 56043, 56341.1, 56380; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.324)

	Determine whether the annual goals for the student are being achieved
	 
	Revise the IEP, as appropriate, to address:
	 
	
		Any lack of expected progress toward the annual goals and in the general education curriculum, where appropriate
		 
		The results of any reassessment conducted pursuant to Education Code 56381
		 
		Information about the student provided to or by the parents/guardians regarding review of evaluation data pursuant to 34 CFR 300.305 and Education Code 56381
		 
		The student's anticipated needs
		 
		Any other relevant matter
		 
	
	
	Consider the special factors listed in Items #5-9 above, under "Development of the IEP," when reviewing the IEP of any student with an exceptional need to whom one of those factors may apply

The IEP team shall also meet at any other time upon request by the student's parent/guardian or teacher to review or revise the IEP.  (Education Code 56343)

When a parent/guardian requests an IEP team meeting to review the IEP, the team shall meet within 30 days of receiving the parent/guardian's written request, not counting days between the student's regular school sessions or terms or days of school vacation in excess of five school days. If a parent/guardian makes an oral request, the District shall notify the parent/guardian of the need for a written request and the procedure for filing such a request.  (Education Code 56043, 56343.5)

A regular education or special education teacher may request a review of the classroom assignment of a student with an exceptional need by submitting a written request to the Superintendent or designee. The Superintendent or designee shall consider the request within 20 days of receiving it, not counting days when school is not in session or, for year-round schools, days when the school is off track. If the review indicates a need for change in the student's placement, instruction, and/or related services, the Superintendent or designee shall convene an IEP team meeting, which shall be held within 30 days of the Superintendent or designee's review, not counting days when school is not in session or days when school is off track, unless the student's parent/guardian consents in writing to an extension of time.

If a participating agency other than the District fails to provide the transition services described in the student's IEP, the team shall reconvene to identify alternative strategies to meet the transition service objectives set out for the student in the IEP.  (Education Code 56345.1; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.324)

If a student with an exceptional need residing in a licensed children's institution or foster family home has been placed by the District in a nonpublic, nonsectarian school, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct an annual evaluation as part of the IEP process of whether the placement is the least restrictive environment that is appropriate to meet the student's needs.  (Education Code 56157)

To the extent possible, the Superintendent or designee shall encourage the consolidation of reassessment meetings and other IEP team meetings for a student.  (20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.324)

When a change is necessary to a student's IEP after the annual IEP team meeting for the school year has been held, the parent/guardian and the Superintendent or designee may agree not to convene an IEP team meeting for the purpose of making the change and instead may develop a written document to amend or modify the student's current IEP. The IEP team shall be informed of any such changes. Upon request, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the parent/guardian with a revised copy of the IEP with the incorporated amendments.  (Education Code 56380.1; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.324)

Audio Recording of IEP Team Meetings

Parents/guardians and the Superintendent or designee shall have the right to audio record the proceedings of IEP team meetings, provided members of the IEP team are notified of this intent at least 24 hours before the meeting. If the Superintendent or designee gives notice of intent to audio record a meeting and the parent/guardian objects or refuses to attend because the meeting would be audio recorded, the meeting shall not be audio recorded. Parents/guardians also have the right to:  (Education Code 56341.1)

	Inspect and review the audio recordings
	 
	Request that an audio recording be amended if they believe it contains information that is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's privacy rights or other rights
	 
	Challenge, in a hearing, information that the parents/guardians believe is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's privacy rights or other rights

Parent/Guardian Participation and Other Rights

The Superintendent or designee shall take steps to ensure that one or both of the parents/guardians of the student with an exceptional need are present at each IEP team meeting or are afforded the opportunity to participate. These steps shall include notifying the parents/guardians of the meeting early enough to ensure that they will have the opportunity to attend and scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed upon time and place.  (Education Code 56341.5; 34 CFR 300.322)

The Superintendent or designee shall send parents/guardians notices of IEP team meetings that:  (Education Code 56341.5; 34 CFR 300.322)

	Indicate the purpose, time, and location of the meeting
	 
	Indicate who will be in attendance at the meeting
	 
	Inform them of:

Additionally, when the IEP team meeting is to consider the development, review, or revision of the IEP of a student with an exceptional need who is 16 years of age or older, or younger than 16 if deemed appropriate by the IEP team, the Superintendent or designee's notice to the student's parents/guardians shall include the following:  (Education Code 56341.5)


	An indication that a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of postsecondary goals and transition services for the student pursuant to Education Code 56345.1, 20 USC 1414, and 34 CFR 300.320
	 
	An indication that the student is invited to the IEP team meeting

At each IEP team meeting convened by the District, the District administrator or specialist on the team shall inform the parent/guardian and student of the federal and state procedural safeguards included in the notice of parental rights provided pursuant to Education Code 56321.  (Education Code 56500.1)

The parent/guardian shall have the right and opportunity to examine all of the student's school records upon request, before any IEP meeting, and in connection with any hearing or resolution session on matters affecting the student, including, but not limited to, initial formal assessment, procedural safeguards, and due process. Upon receipt of an oral or written request, the Superintendent or designee shall provide complete copies of the records within five business days.  (Education Code 56043, 56504)

The parent/guardian shall have the right to present information to the IEP team in person or through a representative and the right to participate in meetings that relate to eligibility for special education and related services, recommendations, and program planning.  (Education Code 56341.1)

If neither parent/guardian can attend the meeting, the Superintendent or designee shall use other methods to ensure parent/guardian participation, including video conferences or individual or conference telephone calls.  (Education Code 56341.5; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.322)

An IEP team meeting may be conducted without a parent/guardian in attendance if the Superintendent or designee is unable to convince the parent/guardian to attend. In such a case, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain a record of the attempts to arrange a mutually agreed upon time and place for the meeting, including:  (Education Code 56341.5; 34 CFR 300.322)

	Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls
	 
	Copies of correspondence sent to the parent/guardian and any responses received
	 
	Detailed records of visits made to the parent/guardian's home or place of employment and the results of those visits

The Superintendent or designee shall give the parents/guardians of a student with an exceptional need a copy of the IEP at no cost.  (Education Code 56341.5; 34 CFR 300.322)

Parent/Guardian Consent for Provision of Special Education and Services

Before providing special education and related services to any student pursuant to 20 USC 1414, the Superintendent or designee shall seek to obtain informed consent of the student's parent/guardian.  (Education Code 56346)

If the parent/guardian fails to respond or refuses to consent to the initiation of services, the District shall not use the due process hearing procedures pursuant to 20 USC 1415 to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services may be provided to the student. In such circumstances, the District shall not be required to convene an IEP team or develop an IEP for the student.  (Education Code 56346)

If the parent/guardian consents in writing to the receipt of special education and related services for the student but does not consent to all of the components of the IEP, then those components to which the parent/guardian has consented shall be implemented so as not to delay providing instruction and services to the student. If the Superintendent or designee determines that a part of a proposed IEP to which the parent/guardian does not consent is necessary in order to provide the student with FAPE, a due process hearing shall be initiated in accordance with 20 USC 1415. While the due process hearing is pending, the student shall remain in the current placement unless the parent/guardian and the Superintendent or designee agree otherwise.  (Education Code 56346)

If at any time subsequent to the initial provision of services, the student's parent/guardian, in writing, revokes consent for the continued provision of special education services, the Superintendent or designee shall provide prior written notice within a reasonable time before ceasing to provide services to the student. The Superintendent or designee shall not request a due process hearing or pursue mediation in order to require an agreement or ruling that services be provided to the student.  (Education Code 56346; 34 CFR 300.300, 300.503)

Prior to the discontinuation of services, the Superintendent or designee may offer to meet with the parents/guardians to discuss concerns for the student's education. However, this meeting shall be voluntary on the part of the parent/guardian and shall not delay the implementation of the parent/guardian's request for discontinuation of services.

When the District ceases to provide special education services in response to the parent/guardian's revocation of consent, the student shall be classified as a general education student.

Transfer Students

To facilitate the transition of a student with an exceptional need who is transferring into the District, the Superintendent or designee shall take reasonable steps to promptly obtain the student's records, including the IEP and the supporting documents related to the provision of special education services.  (Education Code 56325; 34 CFR 300.323)

If the student transfers into the District from another school district within the same Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) during the school year, the District shall continue to provide services comparable to those described in the student's existing IEP, unless the student's parent/guardian and the District agree to develop, adopt, and implement a new IEP that is consistent with state and federal law.  (Education Code 56325; 34 CFR 300.323)

If the student transfers into the District from a school district outside of the District's SELPA during the school year, the District shall provide the student with FAPE, including services comparable to those described in the previous district's IEP in consultation with the student's parent/guardian, for a period not to exceed 30 days. By the end of that period, the District shall either adopt the previous district's IEP or shall develop, adopt, and implement a new IEP that is consistent with state and federal law.  (Education Code 56325; 34 CFR 300.323)

If the student transfers into the District from an out-of-state district during the school year, the District shall provide the student with FAPE, including services comparable to the out-of-state district's IEP, in consultation with the parent/guardian, until such time as the Superintendent or designee conducts an assessment, if it determines that such an assessment is necessary, and develops, adopts, and implements a new IEP, if appropriate.  (Education Code 56325; 34 CFR 300.323)

When appropriate, such services may be offered before or after school.&nbsp; (Education Code 56353)<br>
<br>
<strong>Development of the IEP</strong><br>
<br>
Within 30 days of a determination that a student needs special education and related services, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a meeting to develop an initial IEP is conducted.&nbsp; (Education Code 56043; 34 CFR 300.323)<br>
<br>
Any IEP required as a result of an assessment of a student shall be developed within 60 days from the date of receipt of the parent/guardian&#39;s written consent for assessment, unless the parent/guardian agrees, in writing, to an extension. Days between the student&#39;s regular school sessions, terms, or vacation of more than five school days shall not be counted. In the case of school vacations, the 60-day time limit shall recommence on the date that the student&#39;s school days reconvene.&nbsp; (Education Code 56043, 56344)<br>
<br>
However, when the IEP is required as a result of an assessment of a student for whom a referral has been made 30 days or less prior to the end of the preceding regular school year, the IEP shall be developed within 30 days after the commencement of the subsequent regular school year.&nbsp; (Education Code 56344)<br>
<br>
In developing the IEP, the IEP team shall consider all of the following:&nbsp; (Education Code 56040.6, 56341.1, 56345; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.324)

	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the case of a student whose behavior impedes the student&#39;s learning or that of others, the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports and other strategies to address that behavior<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the case of a student with limited English proficiency, the language needs of the student as such needs relate to the student&#39;s IEP<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the case of a student who is blind or visually impaired, the need to provide for instruction in Braille and instruction in the use of Braille<br>
	<br>
	However, such instruction need not be included in the IEP if the IEP team determines that instruction in Braille or the use of Braille is not appropriate for the student. This determination shall be based upon an assessment of the student&#39;s reading and writing skills, needs, and appropriate reading and writing media, including an assessment of future needs for instruction in Braille or the use of Braille.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The communication needs of the student and, in the case of a student who is deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind, the student&#39;s language and communication needs, opportunities for direct communications with peers and professional personnel in the student&#39;s language and communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct instruction in the student&#39;s language and communication mode<br>
	<br>
	The team shall also consider placements, related services, and program options that provide the student with an equal opportunity for communication access, as described in Education Code 56345.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Whether the student requires assistive technology devices and services, including artificial intelligence devices and services</li>
</ol>
If, in considering the special factors in Items #1-9 above, the IEP team determines that the student needs a particular device or service, including an intervention, accommodation, or other program modification, in order to receive FAPE, the team shall include a statement to that effect in the student&#39;s IEP.&nbsp; (Education Code 56341.1)<br>
<br>
<strong>Provision of Special Education and Related Services</strong><br>
<br>
The District shall ensure that, as soon as possible following development of the IEP, special education and related services are made available to the student in accordance with the IEP.&nbsp; (Education Code 56344; 34 CFR 300.323)<br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the student&#39;s IEP is accessible to each general education teacher, special education teacher, related service provider, and any other service provider who is responsible for its implementation. The Superintendent or designee also shall ensure that such teachers and providers are informed of their specific responsibilities related to implementing the IEP and the specific accommodations, modifications, and supports that must be provided to the student in accordance with the IEP.&nbsp; (34 CFR 300.323)<br>
<br>
If an orientation and mobility evaluation is determined to be needed for a student who is blind, has low vision, or is visually impaired, the evaluation shall be conducted by a person who is appropriately certified as an orientation and mobility specialist and shall occur in familiar and unfamiliar environments, in varying lighting conditions, and in the home, school, and community, as appropriate. The Superintendent or designee may require annual written parent/guardian consent to provide orientation and mobility services when such services are provided before or after school and when they are provided away from the school site.&nbsp; (Education Code 56354; 5 CCR 3051.3)<br>
<br>
If a student&#39;s IEP requires the provision of assistive technology devices or services, including artificial intelligence services, the District shall provide such devices or services and shall, on a case-by-case basis, provide for the use of school-purchased devices or services in the student&#39;s home or other settings if the IEP team determines that the student needs access to those devices or services in order to receive FAPE. If a student who requires the use of an assistive technology device or services transfers to another local educational agency, the District shall provide the student with continued access to that device or services or a comparable device or service for two months from the date the student ceased to be enrolled in the District or until alternative arrangements can be made to provide access to the device, whichever occurs first.&nbsp; (Education Code 56040.3; 34 CFR 300.105)<br>
<br>
<strong>Review and Revision of the IEP</strong><br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the IEP team reviews the IEP periodically, but at least annually, in order to:&nbsp; (Education Code 56043, 56341.1, 56380; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.324)

</ol>
The IEP team shall also meet at any other time upon request by the student&#39;s parent/guardian or teacher to review or revise the IEP.&nbsp; (Education Code 56343)<br>
<br>
When a parent/guardian requests an IEP team meeting to review the IEP, the team shall meet within 30 days of receiving the parent/guardian&#39;s written request, not counting days between the student&#39;s regular school sessions or terms or days of school vacation in excess of five school days. If a parent/guardian makes an oral request, the District shall notify the parent/guardian of the need for a written request and the procedure for filing such a request.&nbsp; (Education Code 56043, 56343.5)<br>
<br>
A regular education or special education teacher may request a review of the classroom assignment of a student with an exceptional need by submitting a written request to the Superintendent or designee. The Superintendent or designee shall consider the request within 20 days of receiving it, not counting days when school is not in session or, for year-round schools, days when the school is off track. If the review indicates a need for change in the student&#39;s placement, instruction, and/or related services, the Superintendent or designee shall convene an IEP team meeting, which shall be held within 30 days of the Superintendent or designee&#39;s review, not counting days when school is not in session or days when school is off track, unless the student&#39;s parent/guardian consents in writing to an extension of time.<br>
<br>
If a participating agency other than the District fails to provide the transition services described in the student&#39;s IEP, the team shall reconvene to identify alternative strategies to meet the transition service objectives set out for the student in the IEP.&nbsp; (Education Code 56345.1; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.324)<br>
<br>
If a student with an exceptional need residing in a licensed children&#39;s institution or foster family home has been placed by the District in a nonpublic, nonsectarian school, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct an annual evaluation as part of the IEP process of whether the placement is the least restrictive environment that is appropriate to meet the student&#39;s needs.&nbsp; (Education Code 56157)<br>
<br>
To the extent possible, the Superintendent or designee shall encourage the consolidation of reassessment meetings and other IEP team meetings for a student.&nbsp; (20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.324)<br>
<br>
When a change is necessary to a student&#39;s IEP after the annual IEP team meeting for the school year has been held, the parent/guardian and the Superintendent or designee may agree not to convene an IEP team meeting for the purpose of making the change and instead may develop a written document to amend or modify the student&#39;s current IEP. The IEP team shall be informed of any such changes. Upon request, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the parent/guardian with a revised copy of the IEP with the incorporated amendments.&nbsp; (Education Code 56380.1; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.324)<br>
<br>
<strong>Audio Recording of IEP Team Meetings</strong><br>
<br>
Parents/guardians and the Superintendent or designee shall have the right to audio record the proceedings of IEP team meetings, provided members of the IEP team are notified of this intent at least 24 hours before the meeting. If the Superintendent or designee gives notice of intent to audio record a meeting and the parent/guardian objects or refuses to attend because the meeting would be audio recorded, the meeting shall not be audio recorded. Parents/guardians also have the right to:&nbsp; (Education Code 56341.1)
<ol>
	<li>Inspect and review the audio recordings<br>
	&nbsp;</li>

</ol>
<strong>Parent/Guardian Participation and Other Rights</strong><br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall take steps to ensure that one or both of the parents/guardians of the student with an exceptional need are present at each IEP team meeting or are afforded the opportunity to participate. These steps shall include notifying the parents/guardians of the meeting early enough to ensure that they will have the opportunity to attend and scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed upon time and place.&nbsp; (Education Code 56341.5; 34 CFR 300.322)<br>

	</ol>
	</li>

If neither parent/guardian can attend the meeting, the Superintendent or designee shall use other methods to ensure parent/guardian participation, including video conferences or individual or conference telephone calls.&nbsp; (Education Code 56341.5; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.322)<br>
<br>
An IEP team meeting may be conducted without a parent/guardian in attendance if the Superintendent or designee is unable to convince the parent/guardian to attend. In such a case, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain a record of the attempts to arrange a mutually agreed upon time and place for the meeting, including:&nbsp; (Education Code 56341.5; 34 CFR 300.322)
<ol>
	<li>Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Copies of correspondence sent to the parent/guardian and any responses received<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Detailed records of visits made to the parent/guardian&#39;s home or place of employment and the results of those visits</li>
</ol>
The Superintendent or designee shall take any action necessary to ensure that the parents/guardians understand the proceedings of the meeting, including arranging for an interpreter for parents/guardians with deafness or whose native language is not English.&nbsp; (Education Code 56341.5; 34 CFR 300.322)<br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall give the parents/guardians of a student with an exceptional need a copy of the IEP at no cost.&nbsp; (Education Code 56341.5; 34 CFR 300.322)<br>
<br>
<strong>Parent/Guardian Consent for Provision of Special Education and Services</strong><br>
<br>
Before providing special education and related services to any student pursuant to 20 USC 1414, the Superintendent or designee shall seek to obtain informed consent of the student&#39;s parent/guardian.&nbsp; (Education Code 56346)<br>
<br>
If the parent/guardian fails to respond or refuses to consent to the initiation of services, the District shall not use the due process hearing procedures pursuant to 20 USC 1415 to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services may be provided to the student. In such circumstances, the District shall not be required to convene an IEP team or develop an IEP for the student.&nbsp; (Education Code 56346)<br>
<br>
If the parent/guardian consents in writing to the receipt of special education and related services for the student but does not consent to all of the components of the IEP, then those components to which the parent/guardian has consented shall be implemented so as not to delay providing instruction and services to the student. If the Superintendent or designee determines that a part of a proposed IEP to which the parent/guardian does not consent is necessary in order to provide the student with FAPE, a due process hearing shall be initiated in accordance with 20 USC 1415. While the due process hearing is pending, the student shall remain in the current placement unless the parent/guardian and the Superintendent or designee agree otherwise.&nbsp; (Education Code 56346)<br>
<br>
If at any time subsequent to the initial provision of services, the student&#39;s parent/guardian, in writing, revokes consent for the continued provision of special education services, the Superintendent or designee shall provide prior written notice within a reasonable time before ceasing to provide services to the student. The Superintendent or designee shall not request a due process hearing or pursue mediation in order to require an agreement or ruling that services be provided to the student.&nbsp; (Education Code 56346; 34 CFR 300.300, 300.503)<br>
<br>
Prior to the discontinuation of services, the Superintendent or designee may offer to meet with the parents/guardians to discuss concerns for the student&#39;s education. However, this meeting shall be voluntary on the part of the parent/guardian and shall not delay the implementation of the parent/guardian&#39;s request for discontinuation of services.<br>
<br>
When the District ceases to provide special education services in response to the parent/guardian&#39;s revocation of consent, the student shall be classified as a general education student.<br>
<br>
<strong>Transfer Students</strong><br>
<br>
To facilitate the transition of a student with an exceptional need who is transferring into the District, the Superintendent or designee shall take reasonable steps to promptly obtain the student&#39;s records, including the IEP and the supporting documents related to the provision of special education services.&nbsp; (Education Code 56325; 34 CFR 300.323)<br>
<br>
If the student transfers into the District from another school district within the same Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) during the school year, the District shall continue to provide services comparable to those described in the student&#39;s existing IEP, unless the student&#39;s parent/guardian and the District agree to develop, adopt, and implement a new IEP that is consistent with state and federal law.&nbsp; (Education Code 56325; 34 CFR 300.323)<br>
<br>
If the student transfers into the District from a school district outside of the District&#39;s SELPA during the school year, the District shall provide the student with FAPE, including services comparable to those described in the previous district&#39;s IEP in consultation with the student&#39;s parent/guardian, for a period not to exceed 30 days. By the end of that period, the District shall either adopt the previous district&#39;s IEP or shall develop, adopt, and implement a new IEP that is consistent with state and federal law.&nbsp; (Education Code 56325; 34 CFR 300.323)<br>
<br>
If the student transfers into the District from an out-of-state district during the school year, the District shall provide the student with FAPE, including services comparable to the out-of-state district&#39;s IEP, in consultation with the parent/guardian, until such time as the Superintendent or designee conducts an assessment, if it determines that such an assessment is necessary, and develops, adopts, and implements a new IEP, if appropriate.&nbsp; (Education Code 56325; 34 CFR 300.323)</body>
