## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following mandated administrative regulation reflects the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 USC 1400-1482), implementing federal regulations (34 CFR 300.1-300.818), and conforming state legislation.  Note that in cases where state law provides greater protections to students, state law supersedes federal law.Both federal and state law give parents/guardians of students with disabilities the right to due process and require the district to provide procedural safeguards, as specified below.  Education Code 56501 extends these rights to the student only if the student is an emancipated minor or a ward or dependent of the court with no available parent/guardian or surrogate parent.  See AR 6159.3 - Appointment of Surrogate Parent for Special Education Students.  As part of these rights, districts must provide two different notices, the prior written notice and the procedural safeguards notice, to parents/guardians at specified times detailed below.
Prior Written Notice

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 1415, districts are mandated to adopt procedures that include prior written notice to parents/guardians of students with disabilities under the circumstances described below. 
The Superintendent or designee shall send to the parents/guardians of any student with disabilities a prior written notice:  (Education Code 56346, 56500.4, 56500.5; 20 USC 1415; 34 CFR 300.102, 300.300, 300.503)

	Before the district initially refers the student for assessment
	 
	Within a reasonable time before the district proposes to initiate or change the student's identification, assessment, educational placement, or the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the student
	 
	Within a reasonable time before the district refuses to initiate or change the student's identification, assessment, or educational placement or the provision of FAPE to the student
	 
	Within a reasonable time before the student graduates from high school with a regular diploma thus resulting in a change in placement
	
	CSBA NOTE: 34 CFR 300.300 states that a parent/guardian may revoke consent for the continued provision of special education and related services at any time.  Upon receipt of this written revocation, 34 CFR 300.300 requires the district to provide prior written notice and, within a reasonable period of time, discontinue all services to the student.  See AR 6159 - Individualized Education Program.
	Upon receipt of the parent/guardian's written revocation of consent for the continued provision of special education and related services to the student

This prior written notice shall include:  (Education Code 56500.4; 20 USC 1415; 34 CFR 300.503)


	A description of the action proposed or refused by the district
	 
	An explanation as to why the district proposes or refuses to take the action
	 
	A description of each assessment procedure, assessment, record, or report the district used as a basis for the proposed or refused action
	 
	A statement that the parents/guardians of the student have protection under procedural safeguards and, if this notice is not an initial referral for assessment, the means by which a copy of the description of procedural safeguards can be obtained
	 
	Sources for parents/guardians to obtain assistance in understanding these provisions
	 
	A description of any other options that the individualized education program (IEP) team considered and why those options were rejected
	 
	A description of any other factors relevant to the district's proposal or refusal

Procedural Safeguards Notice

A procedural safeguards notice shall be made available to parents/guardians of students with disabilities once each school year and:  (Education Code 56301; 20 USC 1415; 34 CFR 300.504)

	Upon initial referral or parent/guardian request for assessment
	
	CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 34 CFR 300.504, the procedural safeguards notice must be provided upon receipt of the first state complaint filed against the district in a school year pursuant to 34 CFR 300.151-300.153. For complaint procedures addressing alleged violation of federal or state law or regulation related to the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE), see the section "State Compliance Complaints" below. 
	Upon receipt of the first state compliance complaint in a school year, filed in accordance with the section "State Compliance Complaints" below
	 
	Upon receipt of the first due process hearing request in a school year
	 
	In accordance with the discipline procedures pursuant to 34 CFR 300.530(h), when  removal of a student because of a violation of a code of conduct constitutes a change of placement
	 
	Upon request by a parent/guardian

CSBA NOTE: 34 CFR 300.504 lists the required content of the procedural safeguards notice.  A sample procedural safeguards notice is available on the California Department of Education's (CDE) web site.
The procedural safeguards notice shall include a full explanation of all of the procedural safeguards available under 34 CFR 300.148, 300.151-300.153, 300.300, 300.502-300.503, 300.505-300.518, 300.520, 300.530-300.536, and 300.610-300.625 relating to:  (Education Code 56301; 20 USC 1415; 34 CFR 300.504)

	Independent educational evaluation

	Information regarding the state special schools for students who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind, visually impaired, or deaf-blind

A copy of this notice shall be attached to the student's assessment plan. At each IEP meeting, the Superintendent or designee shall inform the parent/guardian of the federal and state procedural safeguards that were provided in the notice.  (Education Code 56321, 56500.1)

Format of Parent/Guardian Notices

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 1415 mandates that districts adopt procedures to ensure that the parent/guardian notice is in the native language of the parent/guardian, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so.  34 CFR 300.29 defines "native language" as the language normally used by the individual and, for a child, the language regularly used in the home environment.  Pursuant to 34 CFR 300.503 and 300.504, the notice must be in an "understandable language" as specified below. Districts that subscribe to CSBA's GAMUT Policy Plus may use the program's web-based translator to translate policy documents uploaded into the district's GAMUT web site.
The parents/guardians of a student with a disability shall be provided written notice of their rights in language easily understood by the general public and in their native language or other mode of communication used by them, unless to do so is clearly not feasible.  (Education Code 56341, 56506; 34 CFR 300.503, 300.504)

If the native language of other mode of communication of the parent/guardian is not a written language, the district shall take steps to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means in the parent/guardian's native language or other mode of communication and that the parent/guardian understands the contents of the notice.  (34 CFR 300.503)

The district may place a copy of the procedural safeguards notice on the district's web site.  (20 USC 1415)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that wish to grant parents/guardians the option to receive notices electronically pursuant to 34 CFR 300.505.
A parent/guardian of a student with disabilities may elect to receive the prior written notice or procedural safeguards notice by an electronic mail communication.  (34 CFR 300.505)

Filing Due Process Complaints

CSBA NOTE: In California, due process hearings required by federal law are held only at the state level. Related rights and procedures are set forth in Education Code 56501-56506 and 5 CCR 3080-3089.  Note that in cases where state law provides greater protection, state law supersedes federal law.  When a parent/guardian has revoked consent for the continued provision of special education services to the student, 34 CFR 300.300 specifies that a district may not use the due process hearing procedures to obtain an agreement or a ruling to require that services be provided.   20 USC 1415 mandates that the district adopt procedures regarding a party's right to initiate a due process hearing concerning the issues specified in items #1-4 below.
A parent/guardian and/or the district may initiate due process hearing procedures whenever:  (Education Code 56501; 20 USC 1415)

	There is a proposal to initiate or change the student's identification, assessment, or educational placement or the provision of FAPE to the student.
	 
	There is a refusal to initiate or change the student's identification, assessment, or educational placement or the provision of FAPE to the student.
	 
	The parent/guardian refuses to consent to an assessment of the student.
	 
	There is a disagreement between a parent/guardian and the district regarding the availability of a program appropriate for the student, including the question of financial responsibility, as specified in 34 CFR 300.148.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 1415 and 34 CFR 300.508, the district is mandated to adopt procedures (1) requiring either party (the district or the parent/guardian) or their attorney to provide a due process complaint notice to the other party and (2) requiring that the party may not have a due process hearing until that complaint notice has been filed.  CDE has developed model forms to assist parties in filing a complaint and due process complaint notice.
Prior to having a due process hearing, the party requesting the hearing, or the party's attorney, shall provide the opposing party a due process complaint, which shall remain confidential, specifying:  (Education Code 56502; 20 USC 1415; 34 CFR 300.508)

	The student's name
	 
	The student's address or, in the case of a student identified as homeless pursuant to 42 USC 11434, available contact information for that student
	 
	The name of the school the student attends
	 
	A description of the nature of the student's problem relating to the proposed or refused initiation or change, including facts relating to the problem
	 
	A proposed resolution to the problem to the extent known and available to the complaining party at the time

CSBA NOTE: Although Education Code 56502 states that all requests for a due process hearing must be filed with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, according to CDE's web site, due process hearing requests should be filed with the Special Education Division of the Office of Administrative Hearings.
Parties filing a due process complaint shall file their request with the state Office of Administrative Hearings, Special Education Division. 

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 1415 mandates that the district's procedures include an opportunity to file a complaint about an alleged violation that occurred not more than two years before the parent/guardian or district knew or should have known about the alleged violation, unless an exception specified in law applies. 
The request shall be filed within two years from the date the party initiating the request knew or had reason to know of the facts underlying the basis for the request.  This timeline shall not apply if the district misrepresented that it had solved the problem or withheld required information from the parent/guardian.  (Education Code 56505; 20 USC 1415; 34 CFR 300.507, 300.511)

District's Response to Due Process Complaints

If the district has sent prior written notice to the parent/guardian regarding the subject matter of the parent/guardian's due process complaint, the district shall, within 10 days of receipt of the complaint, send a response specifically addressing the issues in the complaint.  (20 USC 1415; 34 CFR 300.508)

If the district has not sent a prior written notice to the parent/guardian regarding the subject matter contained in the parent/guardian's due process complaint, the district shall send a response to the parent/guardian within 10 days of receipt of the complaint containing:  (20 USC 1415; 34 CFR 300.508):

	An explanation of why the district proposed or refused to take the action raised in the complaint
	 
	A description of other options that the IEP team considered and the reasons that those options were rejected
	 
	A description of each assessment procedure, assessment, record, or report the district used as the basis for the proposed or refused action
	 
	A description of the factors that are relevant to the district's proposal or refusal

Upon the filing of a due process complaint by either party or upon request of the parent/guardian, the district shall inform the parent/guardian of any free or low-cost legal and other relevant services available in the area.  (34 CFR 300.507)

Informal Process/Pre-Hearing Mediation Conference

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 1415 mandates that the district's due process procedures include an opportunity for mediation. Education Code 56500.3 establishes a state-level mediation process.  In addition, Education Code 56502 authorizes an informal meeting process conducted at the local level, as described in the following paragraph.
Prior to or upon initiating a due process hearing, the Superintendent or designee and a parent/guardian may, if the party initiating the hearing so chooses, agree to meet informally toresolve any issue(s) relating to the identification, assessment, education and placement, or provision of FAPE for a student with disabilities.  The Superintendent or designee shall have the authority to resolve the issue(s).  (Education Code 56502)

In addition, either party may file a request with the state Office of Administrative Hearings for a mediation conference.  (Education Code 56500.3)

If resolution is reached that resolves the due process issue(s), the parties shall enter into a legally binding agreement that satisfies the requirements of Education Code 56500.3.  (Education Code 56500.3)

Attorneys may attend or otherwise participate only in those mediation conferences that are scheduled after the filing of a request for due process hearing.  (Education Code 56500.3, 56501)

State Compliance Complaints

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 3200-3205, as added by Register 2020, No. 21, require complaints alleging violation of federal or state law or regulation related to the provision of FAPE to students with disabilities to be submitted to CDE rather than being addressed through the district's uniform complaint procedures as described in BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.  State compliance complaints differ from the due process complaints described above and are investigated and resolved by CDE.Pursuant to 34 CFR 300.152, if a written complaint is the subject of both a state compliance complaint and a due process complaint, or contains multiple issues which include one or more issues that are a part of a due process hearing, CDE must set aside any part of the state compliance complaint that is being addressed in the due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing.
Any individual, including a person's duly authorized representative or an interested third party, public agency, or organization may file with the California Department of Education (CDE) a written and signed statement alleging that, within the previous year, any of the following occurred:  (5 CCR 3200, 3201)

	The district violated Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 USC 1411-1419) and its implementing regulations (34 CFR 300.1-300.818).
	 
	The district violated Part 30 of the Education Code (Education Code 56000-56865) and 5 CCR 3200-3205.
	 
	The district violated the terms of a settlement agreement related to the provision of FAPE, excluding any allegation related to an attorney fees provision in a settlement agreement.
	 
	The district failed or refused to implement a due process hearing order to which the district is subject.
	 
	Physical safety concerns interfered with the provision of FAPE.

The complaint shall include:  (5 CCR 3202; 34 CFR 300.153)


	A statement that the district has violated or failed to comply with any provision set forth in 5 CCR 3201
	 
	The facts on which the statement is based
	 
	The signature and contact information for the complainant
	 
	If alleging violations with respect to a specific student, the student's name and address (or other available contact information for a homeless student), the name of the school that the student is attending, a description of the nature of the student's problem and facts related to the problem, and a proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known and available to the party at the time the complaint is filed

The complainant shall forward a copy of the complaint to the Superintendent or designee at the same time the complaint is filed with CDE.  (5 CCR 3202)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 3203 and 34 CFR 300.152, CDE must complete its investigation of the state compliance complaint within 60 calendar days. This time limit may be extended only if (1) exceptional circumstances exist with respect to the particular complaint or (2) the complainant and the district agree to extend the time to engage in mediation. Within 30 days of the issuance of the investigation report, either the district or the complainant may request reconsideration of the decision.  Within 60 days of receiving the request for reconsideration, CDE must respond in writing to the parties by either denying the request for reconsideration or modifying the investigative report.
Within 30 days of the date of CDE's investigation report, the district or complainant may request reconsideration of the decision in accordance with 5 CCR 3204.  Pending CDE's response, any corrective actions set forth in the report shall remain in effect and enforceable, unless stayed by a court.  (5 CCR 3204)
