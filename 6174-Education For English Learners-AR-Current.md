## Policy Content

Definitions

English learner means a student who is age 3-21 years, who is enrolled or is preparing to enroll in an elementary or secondary school, and whose difficulties in speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language may be sufficient to deny the student the ability to meet state academic standards, the ability to successfully achieve in classrooms where the language of instruction is English, or the opportunity to participate fully in society. An English learner may include a student who was not born in the United States or whose native language is a language other than English; a student who is Native American or Alaska Native, or a native resident of the outlying areas, who comes from an environment where a language other than English has had a significant impact on the individual's level of English language proficiency; or a student who is migratory, whose native language is a language other than English, and who comes from an environment where a language other than English is dominant.  (Education Code 306; 20 USC 7801)

Designated English language development means instruction provided during a time set aside in the regular school day for focused instruction on the state-adopted English language development standards to assist English learners to develop critical English language skills necessary for academic content learning in English.  (5 CCR 11300)

Integrated English language development means instruction in which the state-adopted English language development standards are used in tandem with the state-adopted academic content standards. Integrated English language development includes specially designed academic instruction in English.  (5 CCR 11300)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), has been expanded to include long-term English learners as a numerically significant subgroup, separate from English learners. Pursuant to Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), a "long-term English learner" is defined as a student who has not attained English language proficiency within seven years of initial classification as an English learner. This definition differs from the definition in Educate Code 313.1 and used for the evaluation of English learner programs
Long-term English learner means:


	For the purpose of setting the local control and accountability plan (LCAP) priorities, a student who has not attained English language proficiency within seven years of initial classification as an English learner  (Education Code 52052)
	 
	For the purpose of English language proficiency assessment, an English learner in grades 6- 12 who has been enrolled in school in the United States for six years or more and who either:  (Education Code 313.1)
	 
	
		Has remained at the same English language proficiency level for two or more consecutive years, or has regressed to a lower proficiency level; or
		 
		Is a student in grades 6-9 who has scored far below basic or below basic on the prior year's English language arts standards-based achievement test, or a score determined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction on any successor test
	
	

Native speaker of English means a student who has learned and used English at home from early childhood and English has been the primary means of concept formation and communication.  (Education Code 306)

Identification and Assessments

CSBA NOTE:  Education Code 52164.1 and 5 CCR 11307 require the district to administer a home language survey to all enrolled students. A sample home language survey form in English and Spanish is available on the California Department of Education's (CDE) website.
Upon enrollment in the district, each student's primary language shall be determined through the use of a home language survey.  (Education Code 52164.1; 5 CCR 11307, 11518.5)

CSBA NOTE: When the home language survey indicates that a student's proficiency in English should be tested, Education Code 313 requires the district to administer a state assessment of English language proficiency. The English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) are used for initial identification of language proficiency and subsequently for annual assessment of language proficiency.Although, pursuant to Education Code 313, as amended by AB 2268 (Ch. 15, Statutes of 2024), transitional kindergarten (TK) students are exempted from this assessment requirement, CDE's "Interim Guidance on Transitional Kindergarten Students and English Language Proficiency Testing," recommends that districts continue to conduct the Home Language Survey during TK enrollment to identify whether the primary or native language of a student is a language other than English.Since there may be implications with other state and federal laws, it is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel, as necessary.
Any student in kindergarten or grades 1-12, not including transitional kindergarten, who is identified as having a primary language other than English, as determined by the home language survey, and who has not previously been identified as an English learner by a California public school or for whom there is no record of results from an administration of an English language proficiency test, shall be initially assessed for English proficiency using the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC). Prior to administering the ELPAC, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the student's parent/guardian in writing that the student will be administered the initial ELPAC.  (Education Code 313, 52164.1; 5 CCR 11518.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 11518.25, the district is required to provide English learners with disabilities with the designated supports and accommodations in accordance with the student's individualized education program or Section 504 plan.The Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (20 USC 1412) requires that students with disabilities be included in all state assessments, including the ELPAC as appropriate. Pursuant to 5 CCR 11518.30, students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who cannot participate in the assessment, even with appropriate accommodations, must be given an alternate assessment of English proficiency.Pursuant to Education Code 56305, CDE has developed a manual, "California Practitioners' Guide for Educating English Learners with Disabilities," which provides guidance on identifying, assessing, supporting, and reclassifying English learners with disabilities.
Administration of the ELPAC, including the use of variations and accommodations in test administration when authorized, shall be conducted in accordance with test publisher instructions and 5 CCR 11518.5-11518.37.

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section specifies notifications that must be sent to parents/guardians regarding assessment results and available programs for English learners. CDE has developed sample notification letters, available on its website in multiple translations, to notify parents/guardians of the initial identification of a student as an English learner or as initially fluent English proficient and to notify them of the results of an annual assessment.Pursuant to Education Code 48985, when 15 percent or more of students enrolled in a school speak a single primary language other than English, all notices and reports sent to their parents/guardians must be written in English and in the primary language and may be answered by the parent/guardian in either language.
Based on the initial assessment, the student shall be classified either as Initial Fluent English Proficient or as an English learner. The Superintendent or designee shall notify the student's parent/guardian, in writing, of the results of the ELPAC initial assessment within 30 calendar days after the student's date of initial enrollment, or, if administered prior to the student's initial date of enrollment, up to 60 calendar days prior to such enrollment, but not before July 1 of the school year of the student's initial enrollment. The notice shall indicate whether the student met the ELPAC initial assessment criterion for proficiency and include the district's contact information for use if the parent/guardian has questions or concerns regarding the student's classification.  (5 CCR 11518.5)

CSBA NOTE: The Summative ELPAC is annually administered to students who have been previously identified as English learners based on initial ELPAC results and is used to measure progress toward English language proficiency, to inform English learner programs and services, and to help determine if a student is ready to be reclassified. Education Code 313 provides that the summative ELPAC be conducted annually during a four-month period after January 1 as determined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) with the approval of the State Board of Education (SBE). CDE's, "English Language Proficiency Assessments for California Information Guide," and the "Summative English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, Assessment Fact Sheet," clarify that the Summative ELPAC administration window is open from February 1 through May 31. The following paragraph is consistent with both Education Code 313 and CDE's guidance.
Each year after a student is identified as an English learner and until the student is redesignated as English proficient, the summative assessment of the ELPAC shall be administered to the student during a four-month period after January 1 as determined by the California Department of Education.  (Education Code 313)

The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians of their child's results on the summative assessment of the ELPAC within 30 calendar days following receipt of the results from the test contractor or, if the results are received from the test contractor after the last day of instruction for the school year, within 15 working days of the start of the next school year.  (Education Code 52164.1; 5 CCR 11518.15)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is for use by districts that receive federal funds under either Title I or Title III for services to English learners and may be adapted for use by other districts. Pursuant to Education Code 440 and 20 USC 6312, districts receiving Title I or Title III funds are required to provide parents/guardians with notification of their child's identification as an English learner and placement in a language acquisition program.
The parent/guardian of a student participating in, or identified for participation in, a language instruction program supported by federal Title I or Title III funds shall receive notification of the assessment of the student's English proficiency. Such notice shall be provided no later than 30 calendar days after the beginning of the school year or, if the student is identified for program participation during the school year, within two weeks of the student's placement in the program. The notice shall include all of the following:  (Education Code 313.2, 440; 20 USC 6312)

	The reason for the identification of the student as an English learner and the need for placement in a language acquisition program
	 
	The level of English proficiency, how the level was assessed, and the status of the student's academic achievement
	 
	A description of the language acquisition program in which the student is, or will be, participating, including a description of all of the following:
	 
	
		The methods of instruction used in the program and in other available programs, including how such programs differ in content, instructional goals, and the use of English and a native language in instruction
		 
		The manner in which the program will meet the educational strengths and needs of the student
		
		 
		The manner in which the program will help the student develop English proficiency and meet age-appropriate academic standards for grade promotion and graduation
		 
		The specific exit requirements for the program, the expected rate of transition from the program into classes not tailored for English learners, and the expected rate of graduation from secondary school if applicable
		 
		When the student has been identified for special education, the manner in which the program meets the requirements of the student's individualized education program
		
		CSBA NOTE: Education Code 313.2 requires that the notice contain information in regard to (1) whether the student is a long-term English learner, or English learner at risk of becoming a long-term English learner, and (2) the manner in which the program for English language development instruction will meet the educational strengths and needs of such students and help them develop English proficiency and achieve academic standards. Districts may send an alternate notice if the definitions of long-term English learners and those at risk of becoming long-term English learners used by the district are broader than those defined in Education Code 313.1, the notice states that the definitions utilized by the district are broader, and the notice contains the information specified in Item #4 below.The definition of "long-term English learner" in Education Code 313.1 is an English learner who is  enrolled in any of grades 6-12; has been enrolled in schools in the United States for six years or more; has remained at the same English language proficiency level for two or more consecutive prior years, or has regressed to a lower English language proficiency level; and a student in any of grades 6-9  who  has scored far below basic or below basic on the prior year's English language arts standards-based achievement test administered pursuant to Education Code 60640, or a score determined by the SPI on any successor test. This definition differs from the definition of long-term English learner pursuant to Education Code 52052 for purposes of state and local priorities set forth in the local control and accountability plan (LCAP).
	
	
	As applicable, the identification of a student as a long-term English learner or at risk of becoming a long-term English learner, as defined in Education Code 313.1, and the manner in which the program for English language development instruction will meet the educational strengths and needs of such students and help such students develop English proficiency and meet age-appropriate academic standards
	 
	Information about the parent/guardian's right to have the student immediately removed from a program upon the parent/guardian's request
	 
	Information regarding a parent/guardian's option to decline to enroll the student in the program or to choose another program or method of instruction, if available
	 
	Information designed to assist a parent/guardian in selecting among available programs, if more than one program or method is offered

Language Acquisition Programs

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 11311, districts are required to establish a process for schools to receive and respond to requests from parents/guardians of enrolled students, and those enrolled for attendance in the next school year, to establish a language acquisition program other than, or in addition to, those already available at the school. Each school is required to follow the process even when the district provides the language acquisition program at another school site. The following section includes the components of the process required by 5 CCR 11311 and may be expanded to reflect district practice.
Whenever parents/guardians of enrolled students, and those enrolled for attendance in the next school year, request that the district establish a specific language acquisition program in accordance with Education Code 310, such requests shall be addressed through the following process:  (5 CCR 11311)

	The school shall make a written record of each request, including any request submitted verbally, that includes the date of the request, the names of the parent/guardian and student making the request, a general description of the request, and the student's grade level on the date of the request
	
	As needed, the school shall assist the parent/guardian in clarifying the request.
	
	All requests shall be maintained for at least three years from the date of the request in accordance with Board Policy 3580 - District Records.
	 
	The school shall monitor requests on a regular basis and notify the Superintendent or designee when the parents/guardians of at least 30 students enrolled in the school, or at least 20 students in the same grade level, request the same or a substantially similar type of language acquisition program
	
	If the requests are for a multilingual program model, the district shall consider requests from parents/guardians of students enrolled in the school who are native English speakers in determining whether this threshold is reached.
	 
	If the number of parents/guardians described in Item #2 is attained, the Superintendent or designee shall:
	 
	
		Within 10 days of reaching the threshold, notify the parents/guardians of students attending the school, the school's teachers, administrators, and the district's English Learner Parent Advisory Committee and parent advisory committee, in writing, of the requests for a language acquisition program
		 
		Identify costs and resources necessary to implement any new language acquisition program, including, but not limited to, certificated teachers with the appropriate authorizations, necessary instructional materials, pertinent professional development for the proposed program, and opportunities for parent/guardian and community engagement to support the proposed program goals
		 
		Within 60 calendar days of reaching the threshold number of parents/guardians described in Item #2 above, determine whether it is possible to implement the requested language acquisition program and provide written notice of the determination to parents/guardians of students attending the school, the school's teachers, and administrators
	
	

If a determination is made to implement the language acquisition program, create and publish a reasonable timeline of actions necessary to implement the program. If a determination is made that it is not possible to implement the program, provide a written explanation of the reason(s) the program cannot be provided. The district shall notify parents/guardians at the beginning of each school year or upon the student's enrollment regarding the process to request a language acquisition program, including a dual-language immersion program, for their child. The notice shall also include the following:  (5 CCR 11309, 11310)


	A description of the programs provided, including structured English immersion
	 
	Identification of any language to be taught in addition to English when the program includes instruction in a language other than English
	 
	The manner in which the program is designed using evidence-based research and includes both designated and integrated English language development
	 
	The manner in which the district has allocated sufficient resources to effectively implement the program, including, but not limited to, certificated teachers with the appropriate authorizations, necessary instructional materials, pertinent professional development, and opportunities for parent/guardian and community engagement to support the program goals
	 
	The manner in which the program will, within a reasonable period of time, lead to language proficiency and achievement of the state-adopted content standards in English and, when the program includes instruction in another language, in that other language
	 
	The process to request establishment of a language acquisition program not offered at the school
	 
	For any dual-language immersion program offered, the specific languages to be taught
	
	The notice also may include the program goals, methodology used, and evidence of the proposed program's effectiveness.

The district shall provide additional and appropriate educational services to English learners for the purposes of overcoming language barriers and academic deficits in other areas of the core curriculum.  (5 CCR 11302)

Advisory Committees

CSBA NOTE: The following section should be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to 5 CCR 11308, an advisory committee on programs and services for English learners is required for any district with over 50 English learners and for each school with over 20 English learners. Duties of the advisory committees are specified in Education Code 52176 and 5 CCR 11308.
A school-level English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) shall be established when there are more than 20 English learners at the school. Parents/guardians of English learners, elected by parents/guardians of English learners at the school, shall constitute committee membership in at least the same percentage as English learners represent of the total number of students in the school. The school may designate for this purpose an existing school-level advisory committee provided that it meets these criteria for committee membership.  (Education Code 52176; 5 CCR 11308)

The ELAC shall be responsible for assisting in the development of a schoolwide needs assessment, recommending ways to make parents/guardians aware of the importance of regular school attendance, and advising the principal and school staff in the development of a detailed master plan for English learners for the individual school and submitting the plan to the Governing Board for consideration for inclusion in the district master plan.  (Education Code 52176)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 5 CCR 11308, each school-level English Learning Advisory Committee (ELAC) is entitled to elect at least one member to the District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC). If there are more than 30 ELACs in the district, the district may use a system of proportional or regional representation. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.
When the district has more than 50 English learners, the Superintendent or designee shall establish a District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC), the majority of whose membership shall be composed of parents/guardians of English learners who are not employed by the district. Alternatively, the district may use a subcommittee of an existing districtwide advisory committee on which parents/guardians of English learners have membership in at least the same percentage as English learners represent of the total number of students in the district.  (Education Code 52176)

CSBA NOTE: 5 CCR 11308 delineates the duties of the DELAC, as provided below. The list of DELAC duties on CDE's website omits Item #5, administration of the annual language census. During the federal program monitoring process, CDE will review that the district has a policy in accordance with SBE's, "English Learner Roadmap Policy," that requires the DELAC to advise the Governing Board on the development of a district master plan.
The DELAC shall advise the Board on at least the following tasks:  (5 CCR 11308)

	Developing a district master plan, including policy(ies), for education programs and services for English learners, taking into consideration the school site plans for English learners
	 
	Conducting a districtwide needs assessment on a school-by-school basis
	 
	Establishing a district program, goals, and objectives for programs and services for English learners
	 
	Developing a plan to ensure compliance with applicable teacher or instructional aide requirements
	 
	Administering the annual language census
	 
	Reviewing and commenting on the district's reclassification procedures
	 
	Reviewing and commenting on the required written parental notifications

In order to assist the advisory committee in carrying out its responsibilities, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that DELAC and ELAC committee members receive appropriate training and materials. This training shall be planned in full consultation with the members.  (5 CCR 11308)

Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) Advisory Committee

CSBA NOTE: The following section is applicable if the district's student enrollment includes at least 15 percent English learners, with at least 50 students who are English learners. Education Code 52063 requires that such districts establish an English Learner Parent Advisory Committee to review and comment on the district's LCAP; see BP 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan. 5 CCR 15495 requires this committee to include a majority of parents/guardians of English learners
When there are at least 15 percent English learners in the district, with at least 50 students who are English learners, a district-level English Learner Parent Advisory Committee shall be established to review and comment on the district's LCAP. Such advisory committee shall provide input regarding the district's existing language acquisition programs and language programs, and, where possible, the establishment of other such programs, in accordance with Board Policy 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan. The committee shall be composed of a majority of parents/guardians of English learners. If the DELAC acts as the ELAC pursuant to Education Code 52063 and 52062, the DELAC shall also review and comment on the development or annual update of the LCAP.  (Education Code 52062, 52063; 5 CCR 11301, 15495)

The DELAC may also serve as the LCAP ELAC, as specified in Board Policy 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan

Whenever parents/guardians of enrolled students, and those enrolled for attendance in the next school year, request that the district establish a specific language acquisition program in accordance with Education Code 310, such requests shall be addressed through the following process:&nbsp; (5 CCR 11311)
<ol>
	<li>The school shall make a written record of each request, including any request submitted verbally, that includes the date of the request, the names of the parent/guardian and student making the request, a general description of the request, and the student&#39;s grade level on the date of the request<br>
	<br>
	As needed, the school shall assist the parent/guardian in clarifying the request.<br>
	<br>
	All requests shall be maintained for at least three years from the date of the request in accordance with Board Policy 3580 - District Records.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The school shall monitor requests on a regular basis and notify the Superintendent or designee when the parents/guardians of at least 30 students enrolled in the school, or at least 20 students in the same grade level, request the same or a substantially similar type of language acquisition program<br>
	<br>
	If the requests are for a multilingual program model, the district shall consider requests from parents/guardians of students enrolled in the school who are native English speakers in determining whether this threshold is reached.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If the number of parents/guardians described in Item #2 is attained, the Superintendent or designee shall:<br>
	&nbsp;
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>Within 10 days of reaching the threshold, notify the parents/guardians of students attending the school, the school&#39;s teachers, administrators, and the district&#39;s English Learner Parent Advisory Committee and parent advisory committee, in writing, of the requests for a language acquisition program<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Identify costs and resources necessary to implement any new language acquisition program, including, but not limited to, certificated teachers with the appropriate authorizations, necessary instructional materials, pertinent professional development for the proposed program, and opportunities for parent/guardian and community engagement to support the proposed program goals<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Within 60 calendar days of reaching the threshold number of parents/guardians described in Item #2 above, determine whether it is possible to implement the requested language acquisition program and provide written notice of the determination to parents/guardians of students attending the school, the school&#39;s teachers, and administrators</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
If a determination is made to implement the language acquisition program, create and publish a reasonable timeline of actions necessary to implement the program. If a determination is made that it is not possible to implement the program, provide a written explanation of the reason(s) the program cannot be provided. The district shall notify parents/guardians at the beginning of each school year or upon the student&#39;s enrollment regarding the process to request a language acquisition program, including a dual-language immersion program, for their child. The notice shall also include the following:&nbsp; (5 CCR 11309, 11310)

<ol>
	<li>A description of the programs provided, including structured English immersion<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Identification of any language to be taught in addition to English when the program includes instruction in a language other than English<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The manner in which the program is designed using evidence-based research and includes both designated and integrated English language development<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The manner in which the district has allocated sufficient resources to effectively implement the program, including, but not limited to, certificated teachers with the appropriate authorizations, necessary instructional materials, pertinent professional development, and opportunities for parent/guardian and community engagement to support the program goals<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The manner in which the program will, within a reasonable period of time, lead to language proficiency and achievement of the state-adopted content standards in English and, when the program includes instruction in another language, in that other language<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The process to request establishment of a language acquisition program not offered at the school<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>For any dual-language immersion program offered, the specific languages to be taught<br>
	<br>
	The notice also may include the program goals, methodology used, and evidence of the proposed program&#39;s effectiveness.</li>
