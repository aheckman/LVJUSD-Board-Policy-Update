Compensation

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35120 authorizes Governing Board members to receive compensation for their services, with a maximum amount prescribed based on the district's average daily attendance (ADA) for the prior school year.The district should select the appropriate option below. If the Board selects Option 1, it may, at its discretion, revise the paragraph to reflect the maximum amount applicable to its ADA. If the Board elects to receive less than the maximum amount provided in law, it should select Option 2 and specify the amount.
OPTION 1:  Each member of the Governing Board may receive the maximum monthly compensation as provided for in Education Code 35120.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  Each member of the Governing Board may receive a monthly compensation of $ ________.  (Education Code 35120)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

OPTION 3:  The members of the Governing Board view their Board service as a voluntary contribution to the community and elect not to receive the compensation to which they are entitled pursuant to Education Code 35120.

OPTION 3 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section is for use by districts that selected Option 1 or 2 above.
On an annual basis, the Board may increase the compensation of Board members beyond the limit delineated in Education Code 35120 in an amount not to exceed five percent based on the present monthly rate of compensation.  (Education Code 35120)

Board members are not required to accept payment for meetings attended.

Any member who does not attend all Board meetings during the month is eligible to receive only a percentage of the monthly compensation equal to the percentage of meetings he/she attended, unless otherwise authorized by the Board in accordance with law.  (Education Code 35120)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35120, the Board may adopt a resolution authorizing a Board member to be compensated for meetings he/she missed under specified circumstances. See the accompanying exhibit for a sample resolution.
A member may be compensated for meetings he/she missed when the Board, by resolution, finds that he/she was performing designated services for the district at the time of the meeting or that he/she was absent because of illness, jury duty, or a hardship deemed acceptable by the Board.  (Education Code 35120)

Student Board members shall receive no compensation for meetings attended.  (Education Code 35012)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by any board whose quorum also serves as another legislative body that receives additional compensation. Pursuant to Government Code 54952.3, the disclosure requirements described below are not applicable if the compensation of the legislative body is set by statute.
Whenever a quorum of Board members serves as another legislative body which will meet simultaneously or in serial order to a Board meeting, the Board clerk or a member of the Board shall verbally announce the amount of any additional compensation or stipend that each member will be entitled to receive as a result of convening the simultaneous or serial meeting.  (Government Code 54952.3)

Reimbursement of Expenses

CSBA NOTE: The district is allowed to reimburse Board members for expenses incurred when performing district business. Pursuant to Government Code 8314, it is unlawful for any elected official to use or permit others to use public resources for personal purposes which are not authorized by law. As defined, "personal purposes" include activities for personal enjoyment, private gain or advantage, or an outside endeavor not related to agency business, but do not include the incidental and minimal use of public resources (e.g., equipment or office space) for personal purposes, including an occasional telephone call.
Board members shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred when performing authorized services for the district.  Expenses for travel, telephone, business meals, or other authorized purposes shall be in accordance with policies established for district personnel and at the same rate of reimbursement.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 35044 authorizes reimbursement for Board members for travel expenses incurred when performing services directed by the Board. If the district wishes to require prior Board approval for travel and/or for certain kinds of trips (e.g., out-of-state travel), it should modify the following paragraph accordingly.
Board members shall be reimbursed for travel expenses incurred when performing services directed by the Board.  (Education Code 35044)

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section is optional and may be revised to reflect district practice.
Authorized purposes may include, but are not limited to, attendance at educational seminars or conferences designed to improve Board members' skills and knowledge; participation in regional, state, or national organizations whose activities affect the district's interests; attendance at district or community events; and meetings with state or federal officials on issues of community concern.

Personal expenses shall be the responsibility of individual Board members. Personal expenses include, but are not limited to, the personal portion of any trip, tips or gratuities, alcohol, entertainment, laundry, expenses of any family member who is accompanying the Board member on district-related business, personal use of an automobile, and personal losses and traffic violation fees incurred while on district business.

Any questions regarding the propriety of a particular type of expense should be resolved by the Superintendent or designee before the expense is incurred.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph should be deleted if the district does not issue credit cards to Board members. A policy statement issued by the Institute for Local Government, although primarily applicable to city and county governments, indicates that many local agencies have decided not to issue credit cards to local officials because of the potential for confusing an agency credit card with a personal card and the negative consequences of personal use of an agency card.
Board members may use district-issued credit cards while on official district business and consistent with the limits established for district personnel.  Personal expenses shall not be charged on a district-issued credit card, even if the Board member intends to subsequently reimburse the district for the personal charges.

Health and Welfare Benefits for Current Board Members

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional. The district has the option of providing health and welfare benefits to Board members pursuant to Government Code 53201 and 53205 and has flexibility in selecting the types of coverage and the methods of payment for such coverage. Pursuant to Government Code 53200, health and welfare benefits may include, but are not limited to, hospital, medical, surgical, dental, disability, group life, legal expense, and income protection insurance or benefits. However, Internal Revenue Service Publication 571 indicates that, as elected officials, Board members are not eligible to participate in district programs for the purchase of tax sheltered annuities pursuant to 26 USC 403 and 26 CFR 1.403(b)-2.Pursuant to Government Code 53208.5, the health and welfare benefits of a Board member can be no greater than that received by nonsafety employees of the district or, if the district has different benefit structures, no greater than the most generous schedule of benefits being received by any category of nonsafety employees. Nonsafety employees are those employees not otherwise included in Government Code 20420-20445 defining "safety members" for purposes of membership in the Public Employees' Retirement System. Government Code 53208.5 also provides that Board members shall not be eligible to accrue multiple health and welfare benefits from two or more public agencies for concurrent service, unless the Board member serves as a regular full-time employee in a separate public agency.Government Code 53202 authorizes the district to contract with one or more insurers, health service organizations, or legal service organizations for health and welfare benefits. Alternatively, the district may approve an existing health care arrangement between a Board member and an insurer or health care provider. In 83 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 124 (2000), the Attorney General opined that, if the district chooses to approve such an arrangement, the district may pay for this benefit by way of reimbursement to the Board member who has paid for the benefit instead of direct district payment to the insurer. However, according to the Attorney General, a district may not make cash payments to Board members in lieu of providing them with health insurance benefits.
Board members may participate in the health and welfare benefits program provided for district employees.

Health and welfare benefits for Board members shall be no greater than that received by the district's nonsafety employees with the most generous schedule of benefits.  (Government Code 53208.5)

CSBA NOTE: The district may choose and/or revise any of the following options to reflect district practice.
OPTION 1:  The district shall pay the premiums required for Board members electing to participate in the district health and welfare benefits program to the same extent that it pays for district employees.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  Board members who elect to participate shall pay the full cost of premiums.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

OPTION 3:  The district shall pay $_________ as a reimbursement for costs of approved health plans that have been paid by Board members.

OPTION 3 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that choose to pay all or a portion of premiums, dues, or other charges for health and welfare benefits for a Board member's spouse or dependent children, as authorized by Government Code 53205.1. The district may revise the paragraph to specify a different portion of payment.Pursuant to Family Code 297.5, registered domestic partners have the same rights, protections, and benefits as spouses under California law. Therefore, to the extent that the district provides health benefits under state law to spouses of Board members, the same coverage must be provided to registered domestic partners.Pursuant to Health and Safety Code 1373 and Insurance Code 10277, the age at which a person ceases to be a dependent child is age 26 years or higher as specified in the health plan, unless otherwise provided under a plan that qualifies as a grandfathered plan pursuant to 42 USC 18011. In addition, a health services plan or insurer is required to continue coverage for a dependent child who attains the age specified in the plan if he/she is incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of a physically or mentally disabling injury, illness, or condition and is chiefly dependent on the subscriber or insured for support. Health and Safety Code 1373 and Insurance Code 10277 also require that, if the plan provides coverage for a dependent child who is over age 26 and enrolled at a secondary or postsecondary educational institution, continued coverage must be provided during any break in the school calendar and during a medical leave of absence as specified.
Health and welfare benefits provided to Board members shall be extended at the same level to their spouse/registered domestic partner and to their eligible dependent children as specified in law and the health plan.

Health and Welfare Benefits for Former Board Members

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional. Government Code 53201 authorizes the district to pay premiums for health and welfare benefits for former Board members under the limited circumstances described below. Any district that does not offer benefits to former Board members should delete this entire section.
Former Board members may participate in the health and welfare benefits program provided for district employees under the conditions specified below.

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 53208.5 provides that Board members may not receive benefits greater than those provided to district employees, as provided below. Thus, if a district's collective bargaining agreement specifies that employee eligibility for benefits terminates at age 65, then Board member benefits will also terminate at that time. Districts with such circumstances may expand the following paragraph to indicate the limits of the benefits.
Health and welfare benefits for former Board members shall be no greater than those received by district nonsafety employees with the most generous schedule of benefits.  (Government Code 53208.5)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 53201, a district may pay premiums for health and welfare benefits for former Board members only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the district paid for benefits for former Board members before January 1, 1994; (2) the former Board member served in office after January 1, 1981; (3) the former Board member's term began before January 1, 1995; and (4) the former Board member served for 12 or more years. If the district did not pay benefits for former Board members before January 1, 1994, benefits may be provided to former Board members only on a self-pay basis, even if a former member has served in office for the requisite amount of time.Note: In Thorning v. Hollister School District, the court of appeal ruled that a board policy adopted during the board member's term of office has the effect of vesting him/her with those benefits and that the board cannot subsequently unilaterally withdraw those benefits from those board members.Option 1 below is for use only by districts that paid health and welfare benefits for former board members before January 1, 1994 and choose to continue to do so. Option 2 is for use by districts that are either ineligible to pay for such benefits because they did not pay for former board member benefits before January 1, 1994, have no qualified board members, or choose not to pay for such benefits.Because this is a complex area of law, it is strongly recommended that the district consult with legal counsel before offering paid health benefits to former Board members.
OPTION 1:  (Benefits paid by district)

The district shall pay the premiums for health and welfare benefits of any former Board member who served in office after January 1, 1981, began his/her term before January 1, 1995, and has served for 12 or more years.  (Government Code 53201)

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. If the district allows Board members elected on or after January 1, 1995 to continue benefits at their own expense after leaving service, as authorized by Government Code 53201, it may revise the following paragraph to require more than one term of service at its discretion.
Any other former Board member who served at least one term may participate in the health and welfare benefits program at his/her own expense if coverage is in effect at the time he/she leaves office.  (Government Code 53201)

OPTION 2:  (Benefits paid by former Board member)

CSBA NOTE: At its discretion, the Board may revise the following paragraph to require more than one term of office.
Any former Board member leaving the Board after at least one term of office may participate in the health and welfare benefits program at his/her own expense if coverage is in effect at the time of retirement.  (Government Code 53201)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by all districts. Government Code 53205.1 authorizes the district to fund health and welfare benefits for spouses and dependent children of former Board members.
Health and welfare benefits provided to a former Board member shall be extended, at his/her expense and at the same level, to his/her spouse/registered domestic partner and eligible dependent children as specified in law and the health plan.

<strong><span style="text-autospace:none">Health and Welfare Benefits for Current Board Members</span></strong><br>
<br>
<div id='YMg278' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional. The district has the option of providing health and welfare benefits to Board members pursuant to Government Code 53201 and 53205 and has flexibility in selecting the types of coverage and the methods of payment for such coverage. Pursuant to Government Code 53200, health and welfare benefits may include, but are not limited to, hospital, medical, surgical, dental, disability, group life, legal expense, and income protection insurance or benefits. However, Internal Revenue Service Publication 571 indicates that, as elected officials, Board members are not eligible to participate in district programs for the purchase of tax sheltered annuities pursuant to 26 USC 403 and 26 CFR 1.403(b)-2.<br><br>Pursuant to Government Code 53208.5, the health and welfare benefits of a Board member can be no greater than that received by nonsafety employees of the district or, if the district has different benefit structures, no greater than the most generous schedule of benefits being received by any category of nonsafety employees. Nonsafety employees are those employees not otherwise included in Government Code 20420-20445 defining "safety members" for purposes of membership in the Public Employees' Retirement System. Government Code 53208.5 also provides that Board members shall not be eligible to accrue multiple health and welfare benefits from two or more public agencies for concurrent service, unless the Board member serves as a regular full-time employee in a separate public agency.<br><br>Government Code 53202 authorizes the district to contract with one or more insurers, health service organizations, or legal service organizations for health and welfare benefits. Alternatively, the district may approve an existing health care arrangement between a Board member and an insurer or health care provider. In 83 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 124 (2000), the Attorney General opined that, if the district chooses to approve such an arrangement, the district may pay for this benefit by way of reimbursement to the Board member who has paid for the benefit instead of direct district payment to the insurer. However, according to the Attorney General, a district may not make cash payments to Board members in lieu of providing them with health insurance benefits.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="EMDEMA8" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22EMDEMA8%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22YMg278%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1573258320%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20following%20section%20is%20optional.%20The%20district%20has%20the%20option%20of%20providing%20health%20and%20welfare%20benefits%20to%20Board%20members%20pursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2053201%20and%2053205%20and%20has%20flexibility%20in%20selecting%20the%20types%20of%20coverage%20and%20the%20methods%20of%20payment%20for%20such%20coverage.%20Pursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2053200%2C%20health%20and%20welfare%20benefits%20may%20include%2C%20but%20are%20not%20limited%20to%2C%20hospital%2C%20medical%2C%20surgical%2C%20dental%2C%20disability%2C%20group%20life%2C%20legal%20expense%2C%20and%20income%20protection%20insurance%20or%20benefits.%20However%2C%20Internal%20Revenue%20Service%20Publication%20571%20indicates%20that%2C%20as%20elected%20officials%2C%20Board%20members%20are%20not%20eligible%20to%20participate%20in%20district%20programs%20for%20the%20purchase%20of%20tax%20sheltered%20annuities%20pursuant%20to%2026%20USC%20403%20and%2026%20CFR%201.403%28b%29-2.%5Cn%5CnPursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2053208.5%2C%20the%20health%20and%20welfare%20benefits%20of%20a%20Board%20member%20can%20be%20no%20greater%20than%20that%20received%20by%20nonsafety%20employees%20of%20the%20district%20or%2C%20if%20the%20district%20has%20different%20benefit%20structures%2C%20no%20greater%20than%20the%20most%20generous%20schedule%20of%20benefits%20being%20received%20by%20any%20category%20of%20nonsafety%20employees.%20Nonsafety%20employees%20are%20those%20employees%20not%20otherwise%20included%20in%20Government%20Code%2020420-20445%20defining%20%5C%22safety%20members%5C%22%20for%20purposes%20of%20membership%20in%20the%20Public%20Employees%27%20Retirement%20System.%20Government%20Code%2053208.5%20also%20provides%20that%20Board%20members%20shall%20not%20be%20eligible%20to%20accrue%20multiple%20health%20and%20welfare%20benefits%20from%20two%20or%20more%20public%20agencies%20for%20concurrent%20service%2C%20unless%20the%20Board%20member%20serves%20as%20a%20regular%20full-time%20employee%20in%20a%20separate%20public%20agency.%5Cn%5CnGovernment%20Code%2053202%20authorizes%20the%20district%20to%20contract%20with%20one%20or%20more%20insurers%2C%20health%20service%20organizations%2C%20or%20legal%20service%20organizations%20for%20health%20and%20welfare%20benefits.%20Alternatively%2C%20the%20district%20may%20approve%20an%20existing%20health%20care%20arrangement%20between%20a%20Board%20member%20and%20an%20insurer%20or%20health%20care%20provider.%20In%2083%20Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.%20124%20%282000%29%2C%20the%20Attorney%20General%20opined%20that%2C%20if%20the%20district%20chooses%20to%20approve%20such%20an%20arrangement%2C%20the%20district%20may%20pay%20for%20this%20benefit%20by%20way%20of%20reimbursement%20to%20the%20Board%20member%20who%20has%20paid%20for%20the%20benefit%20instead%20of%20direct%20district%20payment%20to%20the%20insurer.%20However%2C%20according%20to%20the%20Attorney%20General%2C%20a%20district%20may%20not%20make%20cash%20payments%20to%20Board%20members%20in%20lieu%20of%20providing%20them%20with%20health%20insurance%20benefits.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-EMDEMA8" title="CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional.

<div id='ANg283' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 53201, a district may pay premiums for health and welfare benefits for former Board members only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the district paid for benefits for former Board members before January 1, 1994; (2) the former Board member served in office after January 1, 1981; (3) the former Board member's term began before January 1, 1995; and (4) the former Board member served for 12 or more years.

Hollister School District, the court of appeal ruled that a board policy adopted during the board member's term of office has the effect of vesting him/her with those benefits and that the board cannot subsequently unilaterally withdraw those benefits from those board members.<br><br>Option 1 below is for use only by districts that paid health and welfare benefits for former board members before January 1, 1994 and choose to continue to do so. Option 2 is for use by districts that are either ineligible to pay for such benefits because they did not pay for former board member benefits before January 1, 1994, have no qualified board members, or choose not to pay for such benefits.<br><br>Because this is a complex area of law, it is strongly recommended that the district consult with legal counsel before offering paid health benefits to former Board members.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="EMDEMA13" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22EMDEMA13%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22ANg283%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1573258435%2C%22text%22%3A%22Pursuant%20to%20Government%20Code%2053201%2C%20a%20district%20may%20pay%20premiums%20for%20health%20and%20welfare%20benefits%20for%20former%20Board%20members%20only%20if%20all%20of%20the%20following%20conditions%20are%20satisfied%3A%20%281%29%20the%20district%20paid%20for%20benefits%20for%20former%20Board%20members%20before%20January%201%2C%201994%3B%20%282%29%20the%20former%20Board%20member%20served%20in%20office%20after%20January%201%2C%201981%3B%20%283%29%20the%20former%20Board%20member%27s%20term%20began%20before%20January%201%2C%201995%3B%20and%20%284%29%20the%20former%20Board%20member%20served%20for%2012%20or%20more%20years.%20If%20the%20district%20did%20not%20pay%20benefits%20for%20former%20Board%20members%20before%20January%201%2C%201994%2C%20benefits%20may%20be%20provided%20to%20former%20Board%20members%20only%20on%20a%20self-pay%20basis%2C%20even%20if%20a%20former%20member%20has%20served%20in%20office%20for%20the%20requisite%20amount%20of%20time.%5CnNote%3A%20In%20Thorning%20v.%20Hollister%20School%20District%2C%20the%20court%20of%20appeal%20ruled%20that%20a%20board%20policy%20adopted%20during%20the%20board%20member%27s%20term%20of%20office%20has%20the%20effect%20of%20vesting%20him/her%20with%20those%20benefits%20and%20that%20the%20board%20cannot%20subsequently%20unilaterally%20withdraw%20those%20benefits%20from%20those%20board%20members.%5Cn%5CnOption%201%20below%20is%20for%20use%20only%20by%20districts%20that%20paid%20health%20and%20welfare%20benefits%20for%20former%20board%20members%20before%20January%201%2C%201994%20and%20choose%20to%20continue%20to%20do%20so.%20Option%202%20is%20for%20use%20by%20districts%20that%20are%20either%20ineligible%20to%20pay%20for%20such%20benefits%20because%20they%20did%20not%20pay%20for%20former%20board%20member%20benefits%20before%20January%201%2C%201994%2C%20have%20no%20qualified%20board%20members%2C%20or%20choose%20not%20to%20pay%20for%20such%20benefits.%5Cn%5CnBecause%20this%20is%20a%20complex%20area%20of%20law%2C%20it%20is%20strongly%20recommended%20that%20the%20district%20consult%20with%20legal%20counsel%20before%20offering%20paid%20health%20benefits%20to%20former%20Board%20members.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-EMDEMA13" title="CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 53201, a di..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
