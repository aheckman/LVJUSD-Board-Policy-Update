## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes that a well-aligned sequence of courses fosters academic growth and provides for the best possible use of instructional time. The district's course of study shall provide students with opportunities to attain the skills, knowledge, and abilities they need to be successful academically, professionally, and personally.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph should be revised to reflect the grade levels offered by the district. For example, unified school districts need to be concerned about articulation of courses within the district and with postsecondary institutions, whereas elementary districts and high school districts will need to address articulation with each other.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish processes for ensuring the articulation of courses across grade levels within the district. As necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall work with representatives of appropriate area districts and postsecondary institutions to ensure articulation of courses with other institutions to which district students may matriculate. The sequence of courses shall be designed to ensure that each course provides adequate preparation for the next course in the sequence, only utilizes prerequisites that are essential to success in a given program or course, avoids significant duplication of content, and allows for reinforcement and progression in the subject matter.

CSBA NOTE: OCR's August 2023 Dear Colleague Letter, "Race and School Programming," states that a district may not separate students based on race, but may include group discussions or activities that focus on race as part of the curriculum, courses, or programs so long as access or participation is not permitted or limited based on race. OCR's guidance also provides that a school-sponsored program with emphasis on race, such as a student club, that is open to all students, typically would not violate Title VI solely because of its race-related theme.
The district shall not provide any course separately or require or refuse participation by any student on the basis of the student's actual or perceived sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender expression, gender identity, ethnic group identification, immigration status, race, ancestry, national origin, religion, color, mental or physical disability, age, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, or any other characteristic listed in Education Code 200 and 220, Government Code 11135, or Penal Code 422.55, or the student's association with a person or group with one or more of such actual or perceived characteristics.  (Education Code 200, 220; Government Code 11135; Penal Code 422.55; 5 CCR 4940)

Elementary Grades

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts offering elementary grades and may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 51225.4 mandates elementary school districts to certify to the Superintendent of Public Instruction that they have adopted a policy to implement a course of instruction that sufficiently prepares students for the secondary courses required for graduation pursuant to Education Code 51225.3.
The Board shall adopt a course of study for elementary grades that sufficiently prepares students for the secondary course of study.

Secondary Grades

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51228 requires districts to offer students in grades 7-12 a course of study that fulfills the requirements and prerequisites for admission to California public colleges. Education Code 51228 also requires districts to offer such students the opportunity to attain entry-level employment skills. Pursuant to Education Code 51228, districts that adopt a course of study that meets or exceeds the state model curriculum standards in career technical education will be deemed to have satisfied the requirement.Education Code 66204 prohibits a public school from establishing any policy or practice that directs any student away from choosing programs that prepare a student academically for college, especially for cultural or linguistic reasons.The following paragraph is for use by districts maintaining any of grades 7-12 and should be revised to reflect the grade levels offered by the district.
The district shall offer all otherwise qualified students in grades 7-12 a course of study that prepares them, upon graduation from high school, to meet the requirements and prerequisites for admission to California public colleges and universities and to attain entry-level employment skills in business or industry. The district's course of study may provide for a rigorous academic curriculum that integrates academic and career skills, includes applied learning across all disciplines, and prepares all students for high school graduation and career entry.  (Education Code 51228)

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this policy is for use by districts maintaining any of grades 9-12.
In addition, the course of study for students in grades 9-12 shall include instruction in skills and knowledge for adult life, career technical training, and a timely opportunity for all otherwise qualified students to enroll, within four years, in each course necessary to fulfill the requirements and prerequisites for admission to California public colleges and universities prior to graduation.  (Education Code 51224, 51228)

CSBA NOTE: Among the criteria for admission to the University of California (UC) or California State University system is a requirement that high school students satisfactorily complete 15 yearlong/30 semesters of specified courses ("A-G" courses). These include a growing number of career technical education courses that connect knowledge of academic content with practical or work-related applications.In order to qualify as an "A-G" course, the course must first be submitted to and approved by UC.  Education Code 51229 requires that districts annually provide the list of certified courses to the parents/guardians of students in grades 9-12; see the accompanying administrative regulation and E 5145.6 - Parental Notifications.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a process by which courses that meet California college admission criteria (referred to as "A-G" course requirements) are submitted to the University of California for review and certification. The Superintendent or designee shall maintain an accurate list of all current high school courses that have been so certified, shall ensure that the list is provided annually to all students in grades 9-12 and their parents/guardians, and shall make updated lists readily available.  (Education Code 51229, 66204)
