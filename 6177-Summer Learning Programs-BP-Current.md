## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 46120 provides for the Expanded Learning Opportunities (ELO) Program, which includes expanded learning opportunities beyond the regular school day, including summer, vacation, and/or intersessional programs for students in grades transitional kindergarten (TK)-6.Pursuant to Education Code 46120, on non-school days, intersessional programs of specified lengths of time must include in-person before or after school programs.Districts are required to provide an ELO program to specified students. However, student participation in an ELO program is optional. For more information regarding ELO program requirements, see BP/AR 5148.2 - Before/After School Programs.Pursuant to Education Code 46120, as amended by SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), a district that is temporarily prevented from operating its ELO program because of a school site closure due to emergency conditions specified in Education Code 41422 or Education Code 8482.8(d), will not be subject to penalties as a result of the emergency if the Governing Board adopts a resolution and provides documentation substantiating the need for closure.
The Governing Board recognizes that an extended break from the instructional program may result in significant learning loss, especially among disadvantaged and low-achieving students, and desires to provide opportunities during the summer for students to practice essential skills, make academic progress, and focus on developing social, emotional, and physical needs and interests through hands-on engaging learning experiences.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 52060-52077 require districts to develop a local control and accountability plan (LCAP) which includes goals aligned with state and local priorities, specific actions aligned to meet those goals, and a budget aligned to fund those specific actions; see BP/AR 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan. The purposes and content of the district's summer programs should be aligned with the priorities and goals as outlined in the LCAP and other applicable district and school plans.
Summer programs offered by the district shall be aligned with the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP), other applicable district and school plans, and the educational program provided during the school year. When feasible, summer programs shall blend high-quality academic instruction in core curricular and/or elective subjects with recreation, nutrition programs, social and emotional development, and support services that encourage attendance, student engagement in learning, and student wellness.

Summer School

CSBA NOTE: Summer school programs may be funded through a variety of sources that include, but are not limited to, Title I funding (20 USC 6311-6322), After School Education and Safety Program supplemental funds (Education Code 8482-8484.6), 21st Century Community Learning Center supplemental funds (Education Code 8484.7-8484.9; 20 USC 7171-7176), and ELO programs (Education Code 46120); for more information on funding for these programs see BP/AR 5148.2 - Before/After School Programs.Pursuant to Education Code 46120, ELO programs must include at least nine hours of in-person expanded learning opportunities per day for at least 30 non-school days, inclusive of extended school year days provided pursuant Education Code 56345.In addition, Education Code 54444.3 requires agencies receiving Title I Migrant Education funding to conduct summer school for eligible migrant students in grades K-12; see BP/AR 6175 - Migrant Education Program.Option 1 is for districts that are not required to offer summer school. Option 2 is for districts that are required to offer ELO programs on at least 30 non-school days pursuant to Education Code 46120.
OPTION 1 (District is not required to offer summer school)

The Superintendent or designee, with Board approval, may establish summer school day and/or evening classes.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2 (District is required to offer summer school pursuant to Education Code 46120)

The Superintendent or designee shall establish summer school classes pursuant to Education Code 46120.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

The district's summer school program may be used to provide supplemental instruction to students needing remediation and/or enrichment in core academic subjects.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Pursuant to Education Code 43522, until June 30, 2025, districts that receive ELO grant funding are required to implement a learning recovery program that provides supplemental instruction, support for social-emotional well-being, and to the maximum extent permissible as specified in U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines, meals and snacks, to students who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals, English learners, foster youth, students experiencing homelessness, students with disabilities, students at risk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation, disengaged students, and students who are below grade level, including, but not limited to, those who did not enroll in kindergarten in the 2020-21 school year, credit-deficient students, high school students at risk of not graduating, and other students identified by certificated staff. Pursuant to Education Code 43522, districts may utilize ELO grant funding to provide students with extended instructional learning time based on student learning needs through summer school.
The district shall provide students with supplemental instruction and support in a tiered framework that bases universal, targeted, and intensive supports on students' needs for academic, social-emotional, and other integrated student supports through a program of engaging learning experiences in a positive school climate.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional list establishes enrollment priorities for the provision of summer school instruction and may be revised to reflect district practice. Item #1 should be deleted by districts that do not maintain high schools.
As appropriate, priority for enrollment in summer school programs shall be given to district students who:

	Need course credits in order to graduate from high school before the beginning of the next school year
	 
	Have been retained or are at risk of being retained at their grade level
	 
	Demonstrate academic deficiencies in core curriculum areas
	
	CSBA NOTE: Optional Item #4 establishes priority for summer school enrollment to at-risk student groups identified in the district's LCAP. Pursuant to Education Code 52060, the LCAP must include annual goals to be achieved for all students and for each numerically significant subgroup, defined in Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 114 (Ch. 48, Statutes of 2023), to include "long-term English learners." Pursuant to Education Code 52052, as amended by SB 141 (Ch. 194, Statutes of 2023), a "long-term English learner" is defined as a student who has not attained English language proficiency within seven years of initial classification as an English learner. For schools or districts with 11-99 students, numerically significant student subgroups are defined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction with approval by the State Board of Education.
	Are in student groups identified in the district's LCAP as needing increased or improved services to succeed in the educational program
	
	CSBA NOTE: A district that operates an intersession program, including summer school, is required to grant priority access to a foster youth pursuant to Education Code 48853.5, as amended by AB 723 (Ch. 812, Statutes of 2023), and to a student experiencing homelessness, pursuant to Education Code 48850, as amended by AB 373 (Ch. 327, Statutes of 2023). If any such student will be moving during an intersession period, the student's educational rights holder, or in the case of an American Indian student, Indian custodian, is authorized to determine which school the student attends for the intersession period.
	Are foster youth and/or are students experiencing homelessness
	
	If during an intersession period the student will be moving, the student's educational rights holder or, in the case of an American Indian child, Indian custodian, shall determine which school the student attends for the intersession period, if applicable.  (Education Code 48850, 48853.5)
	
	CSBA NOTE: Districts with a prior fiscal year local control funding formula (LCFF) unduplicated pupil percentage (UPP) of at least 75 percent are required to offer access to ELO programs to all classroom-based students in grades TK-6 inclusive, and to ensure that access is provided to any student whose parent/guardian requests placement in an ELO program. Districts with a prior fiscal year LCFF UPP of less than 75 percent are required to offer access to ELO programs to all unduplicated students in grades TK-6, inclusive, and ensure that access is provided to any unduplicated student whose parent/guardian requests placement in an ELO program.
	Are transitional kindergarten or kindergarten children, or in any of grades 1-6 and are required to be offered or provided access to Expanded Learning Opportunities (ELO) Programs pursuant to Education Code 46120 and BP/AR 5184.2 - Before/After School Programs

CSBA NOTE:  Option 1 below is for districts that permit remaining students to enroll in summer school on a first-come first-served basis. Option 2 is for districts that utilize a lottery to select remaining students to enroll in summer school.
OPTION 1: (First-come first-served)

The remaining openings shall be offered to other district students on a first-come first-served basis.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2: (Lottery)

The remaining openings shall be offered to other district students on a lottery basis.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph should be modified to reflect district practice.
Because summer courses cover extensive instructional content in a relatively short time period, students who have more than three excused absences or one unexcused absence may not receive credit for summer session class(es) unless they make-up missed work in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.

CSBA NOTE: State funding is not available for transportation to summer school. To accommodate students and parents/guardians who need to provide their own transportation, some districts rotate the sites at which summer sessions are offered, as provided in the following optional paragraph.
Sites for summer school programs may be rotated in an effort to make summer school programs more accessible to all students, regardless of residence or regular attendance area, and to accommodate the maintenance needs of district schools.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 46120, any student who attends a school that is not operating an ELO program must be provided transportation to attend at a location that is providing an ELO program, and to return to the original location or another location that is established by the district.
The district shall provide any student who attends a school that is not operating an ELO program transportation to attend at a location that is providing an ELO program and to return to the original location or another location that is established by the district.  (Education Code 46120)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph should be revised to reflect indicators for program evaluation that have been agreed upon by the Board and Superintendent, as well as a timeline for reports to the Board.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board on summer school enrollment in the current year and previous year for the program as a whole and disaggregated by grade level, school that the students attend during the regular school year, and student population. In addition, the Superintendent or designee may report on the extent to which students successfully achieved the outcomes established for the program.

Additional Summer Learning Opportunities

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice and may be adapted for use during intersessions other than summer break. For further information about summer learning opportunities, see BP/AR 5148.2 - Before/After School Programs and CSBA's Summer Learning and Wellness Resource Guide.Districts are prohibited from charging a fee for summer school programs. However, it is permissible for third parties that offer a summer school program to charge a fee for such program. CDE's, "Fiscal Management Advisory 22-01, Summer School, Third Parties, and Tuition Fees," provides that if a third party that is affiliated with a district charges tuition for a summer program, the district should make an individualized inquiry as to the relationship between the district and the third party to determine whether the educational activities are being offered by the district. In making this determination, districts may consider factors listed in "Fiscal Management Advisory 22-01." Districts with questions as to whether a fee may be charged for summer school should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel. See also BP/AR 3260 - Fees and Charges.
The Superintendent or designee may collaborate with parents/guardians, city and county agencies, community organizations, child care providers, and/or other interested persons to develop, implement, and build awareness of organized activities that support summer learning.

Strategies to support summer learning may include, but are not limited to:

	Providing information to students and parents/guardians about summer reading programs scheduled to be conducted by public libraries or community organizations
	 
	Collaborating with the local parks and recreation agency and/or community organizations to provide day camps, sports programs, or other opportunities for physical education and activity
	 
	Collaborating with workforce development agencies, businesses, and community organizations to provide summer job training opportunities that include an academic component
	 
	Encouraging reading in the home, such as providing lists of recommended reading to students and parents/guardians, establishing a target number of books or pages, and providing prizes for achievement of reading goals
	 
	Assigning summer vacation homework in core curricular subject(s) for extra credit
	 
	Conducting occasional, interactive "fun days" during the summer to provide activities related to art, music, science, technology, mathematics, environmental science, multicultural education, debate, or other subject
	 
	Arranging opportunities for community service

<br>
<div id='QOA715' class='edComm hideComments'>CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice and may be adapted for use during intersessions other than summer break. For further information about summer learning opportunities, see BP/AR 5148.2 - Before/After School Programs and CSBA's Summer Learning and Wellness Resource Guide.<br><br>Districts are prohibited from charging a fee for summer school programs. However, it is permissible for third parties that offer a summer school program to charge a fee for such program. CDE's, "Fiscal Management Advisory 22-01, Summer School, Third Parties, and Tuition Fees," provides that if a third party that is affiliated with a district charges tuition for a summer program, the district should make an individualized inquiry as to the relationship between the district and the third party to determine whether the educational activities are being offered by the district.
