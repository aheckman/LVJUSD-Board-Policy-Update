At his/her discretion, the Superintendent or designee may refuse to give a recommendation.

The Superintendent or designee may communicate information about the job performance or qualifications of a current or former District employee when such information is based upon credible evidence and is given to a prospective employer without malice and at the prospective employer's request.  (Civil Code 47)

Any reference, letter of recommendation, or information provided about the reasons for separation issued on behalf of the District shall provide a truthful and accurate account of the employee's job performance and qualifications.

No certificated employee shall write or sign any letter or memorandum which intentionally omits significant facts, or which states as facts matters which the writer does not know of his/her own knowledge to be true, relating to the professional qualifications or personal fitness to perform certificated services of any person who the writer knows will use the letter or memorandum to obtain professional employment.  (5 CCR 80332)

No certificated employee shall agree to provide a positive letter of recommendation which misrepresents facts as a condition of another employee's resigning or withdrawing action against the District.  (5 CCR 80332)
