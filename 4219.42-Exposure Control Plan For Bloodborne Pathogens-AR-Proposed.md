## Policy Content

Definitions

Occupational exposure means reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee's duties.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

Exposure incident means a specific eye, mouth, other mucous membrane, nonintact skin, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that results from the performance of an employee's duties.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

Parenteral contact means piercing mucous membranes or the skin barrier through such events as needlesticks, human bites, cuts, and abrasions.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

A sharp is any object that can be reasonably anticipated to penetrate the skin or any other part of the body and to result in an exposure incident.  (8 CCR 5193)

A sharps injury is any injury caused by a sharp, including, but not limited to, cuts, abrasions, or needlesticks.  (8 CCR 5193)

Work practice controls are controls that reduce the likelihood of exposure by defining the manner in which a task is performed.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

Engineering controls are controls, such as sharps disposal containers, needleless systems, and sharps with engineered sharps injury protection, that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogens hazard from the workplace.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

Engineered sharps injury protection is a physical attribute, such as a barrier, blunting, encapsulation, withdrawal, or other effective mechanism, built into a needle device or into a non-needle sharp which effectively reduces the risk of an exposure incident.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

Personal protective equipment is specialized clothing or equipment worn or used by an employee for protection against a hazard, such as gloves, gowns, laboratory coats, face shields or masks.  (8 CCR 5193)

Exposure Control Plan

The District's written exposure control plan for bloodborne pathogens shall contain at least the following components:  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

	A determination of which employees have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials, which shall be made without regard to employees' use of personal protective equipment and shall include a list of:
	 
	
		All job classifications in which all employees have occupational exposure
		 
		Job classifications in which some employees have occupational exposure
		 
		All tasks and procedures, or groups of closely related tasks and procedures, in which occupational exposure occurs and which are performed by employees listed in item #1b above
		 
	
	
	The schedule and method of implementing each of the following in accordance with 8 CCR 5193 and this administrative regulation:
	 
	
		Methods of compliance required by 8 CCR 5193(d) and 29 CFR 1910.1030, including universal precautions, general and specific engineering and work practice controls, and personal protective equipment
		 
		Hepatitis B vaccination 
		 
		Bloodborne pathogen post-exposure evaluation and follow-up
		 
		Communication of hazards to employees through information and training 
		 
		Recordkeeping, including medical records, training records, and a log of sharps injuries 
		 
	
	
	The District's procedure for documenting the route(s) of exposure and the circumstances under which exposure incidents occurred 
	 
	An effective procedure for gathering information about each exposure incident involving a sharp
	 
	An effective procedure for periodically determining the frequency of use of the types and brands of sharps involved in exposure incidents 
	 
	An effective procedure for identifying currently available engineering controls and selecting such controls, as appropriate, for the procedures performed by employees in their work areas or departments
	 
	An effective procedure for documenting instances when a licensed healthcare professional directly involved in an employee's care determines that the use of an engineering control would jeopardize the employee's safety or the success of a medical, dental, or nursing procedure involving the employee
	 
	An effective procedure for obtaining the active involvement of employees in reviewing and updating the exposure control plan with respect to the procedures performed by employees in their respective work areas or departments

The additional training may be limited to addressing the new exposures created.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)

Designated first aid providers shall receive training that includes the specifics of reporting first-aid incidents which involve blood or body fluids which are potentially infectious.  (8 CCR 5193)

Reporting Incidents

All exposure incidents shall be reported as soon as possible to the Superintendent or designee.

Unvaccinated designated first aid providers must report any first aid incident involving the presence of blood or other potentially infectious material, regardless of whether an exposure incident occurred, by the end of the work shift. The full hepatitis B vaccination series shall be made available to such employees no later than 24 hours after the first aid incident.  (8 CCR 5193)

Sharps Injury Log

The Superintendent or designee shall establish and maintain a log recording each exposure incident involving a sharp.  (8 CCR 5193; 29 CFR 1910.1030)
