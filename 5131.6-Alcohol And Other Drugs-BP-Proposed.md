## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that the use of alcohol or other drugs adversely affects a student's ability to achieve academic success, is physically and emotionally harmful, and has serious social and legal consequences. The Superintendent or designee shall develop comprehensive programs and activities to foster safe, healthy, and drug-free environments that support academic achievement.

The District's alcohol and drug prevention and intervention programs shall be coordinated with other school and community-based services and programs and shall promote the involvement of parents/guardians. The Superintendent or designee may collaborate with the county office of education, community-based organizations, health providers, law enforcement agencies, local child welfare agencies, postsecondary institutions, businesses, and other public and private entities in program planning, implementation, and evaluation.

Prevention and intervention programs and activities may include, but are not limited to:  (20 USC 7118)

	Evidence-based drug and violence prevention activities and programs that educate students against the use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, smokeless tobacco products, and electronic cigarettes
	 
	Professional development and training for school staff, specialized instructional support personnel, and interested community members on drug prevention, education, early identification, intervention mentoring, recovery support services, and, where appropriate, rehabilitation referral
	 
	School-based mental health services, including early identification of drug use and referrals to counseling services, and/or partnerships with public or private health care entities that have qualified mental and behavioral health professionals
	 
	Programs and activities that provide mentoring and school counseling to all students, including students who are at risk of drug use and abuse

Instruction and Notification

The District shall provide science-based preventative instruction, consistent with law, the accompanying administrative regulation, and Board Policy 5141.52 - Suicide Prevention, which has been proven effective in helping students avoid the use of alcohol and other drugs.

All instruction and related materials shall consistently state that unlawful use of alcohol or other drugs is prohibited. Instruction shall not include any message on responsible use of drugs or alcohol when such use is illegal.  (Health and Safety Code 11999.2)

The District shall offer staff development activities for staff who implement the comprehensive drug and alcohol prevention and intervention program.

The District shall annually inform parents/guardians at the beginning of the first semester or quarter of the regular school year about the dangers associated with the use of synthetic drugs that are not prescribed by a physician, such as fentanyl, the possibility that dangerous drugs can be found in counterfeit pills, and the risks of social media being used as a way to market and sell synthetic drugs. Additionally, the District, and each school that maintains its own website, shall post such information on its website.  (Education Code 48985.5)

Intervention, Referral, and Student Assistance Programs

The Superintendent or designee shall inform school staff, students, and parents/guardians about early warning signs, which may indicate alcohol and other drug use, and about appropriate agencies offering intervention programs, counseling, referral, and other student assistance programs.

The Board strongly encourages any student who is using alcohol or drugs to discuss the matter with the student's parent/guardian or with any staff member. Students who disclose their use of alcohol or other drugs when seeking help from an intervention or recovery program shall not be disciplined for such use, including that, in accordance with Education Code 48900, students who voluntarily disclose their use of a tobacco product, controlled substance, alcohol, or an intoxicant of any kind in order to seek help through services or supports shall not be suspended.

Opioid Antagonists

Students in middle school, junior high school, high school, or adult school, may carry fentanyl test strips or a federally approved opioid antagonist for the emergency treatment of persons suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an opioid overdose, while on a school site or participating in a school activity.  (Education Code 49414.6)

Additionally, students 12 years of age or older, while on a school site or participating in school activities, may carry and administer a naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray or any other opioid overdose reversal medication that is federally approved for over-the counter nonprescription use for the purpose of providing emergency treatment to persons who are suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an opioid overdose.  (Education Code 49414.35)

Enforcement and Discipline

Unless otherwise authorized by law, students shall not possess, use, or sell alcohol or other drugs and related paraphernalia on school grounds or at school-sponsored activities.

The Superintendent or designee shall clearly communicate to all students, staff, and parents/guardians the District's policies, regulations, and school rules related to the use of alcohol and other drugs.

Any student found by the Board to be selling a controlled substance listed in Health and Safety Code 11053-11058 shall be recommended for expulsion in accordance with Board Policy/Administrative Regulation 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process. A student found to have committed another drug or alcohol offense, including possession or intoxication, shall be referred to appropriate behavioral interventions or student assistance programs, and may be subject to discipline on a case-by-case basis.

The District may use alternatives to the referral of a student to a law enforcement agency in response to an incident involving the student's misuse of an opioid, to the extent any alternative utilized is not in conflict with any law requiring that referral.  (Education Code 49414.4)

Program Evaluation

The Board and Superintendent shall agree upon performance measures that will be used to monitor and determine the effectiveness of District programs in reducing drug and alcohol use. The Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Board on the effectiveness of District activities in achieving identified objectives and outcomes.  (20 USC 7116)
