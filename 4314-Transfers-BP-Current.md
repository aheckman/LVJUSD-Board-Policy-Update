## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy addresses the transfer of administrative or supervisory employees between identical positions and should be modified to reflect district practice.  For language regarding the reassignment of an employee to the classroom or a different position, see BP/AR 4313.2 - Demotion/Reassignment.The determination as to whether an action is a "transfer to an identical position" or a "demotion/reassignment" is complex and dependent on the facts of the situation (e.g., placement on the salary schedule). Districts should proceed cautiously and consult legal counsel as appropriate.
The Governing Board recognizes the importance of placing employees in positions that best utilize their skills and talents, help improve student achievement, and provide the most benefit to the district. 

Upon the recommendation of the Superintendent or designee, the Board shall approve the transfer or rotation of administrative or supervisory personnel to the same position at another location for reasons including, but not limited to, the need to improve student achievement and operational efficiency, utilize the skills and talents of the employee more effectively, provide opportunities for professional growth, provide an opportunity for evaluating employees in different school settings or locations, and best accommodate the overall needs of the district.

The Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures to enable administrative or supervisory personnel to request a transfer to a vacant position.
