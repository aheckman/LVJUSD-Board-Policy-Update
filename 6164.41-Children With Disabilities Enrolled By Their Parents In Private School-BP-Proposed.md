## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes its obligations under state and federal law to locate, identify, evaluate, and provide equitable services to children voluntarily enrolled by their parents/guardians in private schools located within the District.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that activities to locate, identify, and evaluate children with disabilities enrolled by their parents/guardians in private schools within the District are comparable to activities undertaken for individuals with disabilities aged three to 22 in public schools within the District.  (Education Code 56171; 34 CFR 300.131)

The Superintendent or designee shall develop a budget for the provision of services to children with disabilities enrolled by their parents/guardians in private school based on the proportionate share of federal funds received and the number of eligible children, including the possibility of mid-year enrollees, and the types of services to be provided.
