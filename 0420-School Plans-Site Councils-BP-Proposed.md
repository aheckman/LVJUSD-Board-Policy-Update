## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that comprehensive planning is necessary at each school in order to focus school improvement efforts on student academic achievement and facilitate the effective use of available resources. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that school plans provide clear direction and identify cohesive strategies aligned with school and District goals.

Each District school that participates in one or more federal and/or state categorical programs funded through the state's consolidated application process pursuant to Education Code 64000 shall establish a school site council in accordance with Education Code 65000-65001.  The school site council shall develop, approve, and annually review and update a school plan for student achievement (SPSA) which consolidates the plans required for those categorical programs into a single plan, unless otherwise prohibited by law.  (Education Code 64001)

The Superintendent or designee shall review each school's SPSA to ensure that it meets the content requirements for all applicable programs, is based on an analysis of current practices and student academic performance, and reasonably links improvement strategies to identified needs of the school and its students. The Superintendent or designee shall also ensure consistency between the specific actions included in the District's local control and accountability plan and the strategies identified in each school's SPSA.

The Board shall, at a regularly scheduled Board meeting, review and approve each school's SPSA whenever there are any material revisions affecting the academic programs for students participating in the categorical programs addressed in the SPSA.  (Education Code 64001)

If the Board does not approve a school's SPSA, it shall communicate its specific reasons for disapproval of the plan to the school site council. The school site council shall then revise and resubmit the SPSA to the Board for its approval.  (Education Code 64001)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that school administrators and school site council members receive training on the roles and responsibilities of the school site council.

The SPSA may serve as the school improvement plan required when a school is identified for targeted or comprehensive support pursuant to 20 USC 6303.  (Education Code 64001)

Any complaint alleging noncompliance with requirements related to the establishment of school site councils or the development of the SPSA may be filed with the District in accordance with the District's uniform complaint procedures pursuant to 5 CCR 4600-4670 and BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.  (Education Code 64001)
