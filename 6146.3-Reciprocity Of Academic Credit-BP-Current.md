## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy should be modified to reflect district practice.
To determine whether students transferring into the district have met district course requirements, the Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures to evaluate the comparability of courses and/or students' understanding of course content. Such procedures shall include methods for determining the number of years of school attendance, the specific courses completed by the student and the value of credits earned.

CSBA NOTE: AB 490 (Ch. 862, Statutes of 2003) amended Education Code 48645.5 to require districts to accept for credit full or partial coursework completed in a public school or nonpublic nonsectarian school or agency in addition to a juvenile court school.
The district shall accept for credit full or partial coursework satisfactorily completed by students while attending a public school, a juvenile court school or nonpublic nonsectarian school or agency.  (Education Code 48645.5)

Pending evaluation of the transferring student's academic performance, the student shall be placed at the grade level reached prior to enrollment in the district.  Within 30 days of enrollment, the principal or designee shall complete the evaluation and determine the student's appropriate grade placement.
