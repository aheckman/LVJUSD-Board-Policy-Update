## Policy Content

The Board of Education desires to provide a research-based, sequential curriculum which promotes high levels of student achievement and emphasizes the development of basic skills, problem solving, and decision making.  Upon recommendation of the Superintendent or designee, the Board shall adopt a written District curriculum which describes, for each subject area and grade level, the content objectives which are to be taught in all District schools.

The District's curriculum shall be aligned with the District's vision and goals for student learning, Board policies, academic content standards, state curriculum frameworks, state and District assessments, graduation requirements, school and District improvement plans, and, when necessary, related legal requirements. 

The Superintendent or designee shall establish a process for curriculum development, selection, and/or adaptation which utilizes the professional expertise of teachers, principals, and District administrators representing various grade levels, disciplines, special programs, and categories of students as appropriate. The process also may provide opportunities for input from students, parents/guardians, representatives of local businesses and postsecondary institutions, and other community members.

The selection and evaluation of instructional materials shall be coordinated with the curriculum development and evaluation process.

When presenting a recommended curriculum for adoption, the Superintendent or designee shall provide research, data, or other evidence demonstrating the proven effectiveness of the proposed curriculum. He/she also shall present information about the resources that would be necessary to successfully implement the curriculum and describe any modifications or supplementary services that would be needed to make the curriculum accessible to all students.

In addition, the Board may require a review of the curriculum in one or more subject areas as needed in response to student assessment results; feedback from teachers, administrators, or parent/guardians; new research on program effectiveness; or changing student needs.
