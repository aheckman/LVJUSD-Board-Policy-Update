## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional board policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Pursuant to Government Code 16.5, public entities, including districts, are permitted to use digital signatures in their communications and operations. A digital signature is a type of electronic signature, as defined in Civil Code 1633.1. Any such digital or electronic signature has the same force and effect as a manual signature, provided the signature is created using acceptable technology and includes attributes specified in 2 CCR 22000-22005, as described in the accompanying administrative regulation. In addition, Civil Code 1633.1-1633.17 (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act) and 15 USC 7001-7006 (Electronic Records and Signatures in Commerce Act) provide a framework for ensuring the validity of electronic contracts and security of electronic signatures in commerce and governmental transactions.
The Governing Board believes that the use of electronic records and signatures is a convenient paperless option that can increase efficiency in commercial and administrative transactions, reduce costs, and contribute to environmental sustainability in district operations. The Board authorizes the use of electronic signatures in district operations when authorized by law. 

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any electronic signature utilized by the district conforms with criteria described in law and that the level of security is sufficient for the transaction being conducted.  (Government Code 16.5; 2 CCR 22003, 22005)

The Superintendent or designee shall retain electronic records in accordance with law and regulations, and as specified in BP/AR 3580 - District Records.
