## Policy Content

At each school, the principal or designee shall establish emergency procedures, rules for student conduct, and rules for the safe and appropriate use of school facilities, equipment, and materials, consistent with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation. The rules shall be communicated to students, distributed to parents/guardians, and readily available at the school at all times.

Release of Students

Students shall be released during the school day only to the custody of an adult who is one of the following:

	The student's custodial parent/guardian
	 
	An adult authorized on the student's emergency card as an individual to whom the student may be released when the custodial parent/guardian cannot be reached, provided the principal or designee verifies the adult's identity
	 
	An authorized law enforcement officer acting in accordance with law
	 
	An adult taking the student to emergency medical care at the request of the principal or designee

Supervision of Students

Teachers shall be present at their respective rooms and shall open them to admit students not less than 30 minutes before the time that school starts.  (5 CCR 5570)

Every teacher shall hold students to a strict account for their conduct on the way to and from school, on the playgrounds, and during recess.  (Education Code 44807)

The principal or designee shall require all individuals supervising students to remain alert for unauthorized persons and dangerous conditions, and promptly report any unusual incidents to the principal or designee and file a written report as appropriate.

Any certificated or classified employee, or other school official, whose duties bring the employee or other school official in contact on a regular basis with students in any of grades 6-12, as part of a middle of high school, who are alerted to or observe any threat or perceived threat of a homicidal act, as defined, shall immediately report the threat or perceived threat to law enforcement in accordance with Education Code 49393.  (Education Code 49390, 49393)

Threat or perceived threat means any writing or action of a student that creates a reasonable suspicion that the student is preparing to commit a homicidal act related to school or a school activity. This may include possession, use, or depictions of firearms, ammunition, shootings, or targets in association with infliction of physical harm, destruction, or death in a social media post, journal, class note, or other media associated with the student. It may also include a warning by a parent, student, or other individual.

Additionally, anyone who receives or learns of a health or safety threat related to school or a school activity is encouraged to report the threat to a school or District administrator.

In arranging for appropriate supervision on playgrounds, the principal or designee shall:

	Clearly identify supervision zones and require all playground supervisors to remain at a location from which they can observe their entire zone of supervision and be observed by students in the supervision zone
	 
	Consider the size of the playground area, the number of areas that are obstructed from open view, and the age of the students to determine the ratio of playground supervisors to students

At any school where playground supervision is not otherwise provided, the principal or designee shall provide for certificated employees to supervise the conduct and safety, and direct the play, of students who are on school grounds before and after school and during recess and other intermissions.  (5 CCR 5552)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that teachers, teacher aides, playground supervisors, yard aides, and volunteers who supervise students receive training in safety practices and in supervisory techniques that will help prevent problems and resolve conflicts among students. Additionally, all staff and other school officials shall be made aware of their responsibilities regarding the reporting of potential homicidal acts to law enforcement, and receive training in the assessment and reporting of such threats. The training shall be documented and kept on file.

Student Safety Patrols

A school safety patrol shall be composed of students of the school selected by the principal or designee and shall be allowed to serve only with written consent of the students and their parents/guardians. Patrol members shall be at least 10 years old and in the fifth grade.  (Education Code 49302; 5 CCR 571)

School safety patrols shall be used only at those locations where the nature of traffic will permit their safe operation. The locations where school safety patrols are used should be determined jointly with the local law enforcement agency.  (5 CCR 572)

Patrol members shall be under the supervision and control of the principal or designee and shall receive training in proper procedures, including, but not limited to, the operations specified in 5 CCR 573-574. Whenever on duty, patrol members shall wear the standard uniform required by 5 CCR 576.

Playground Safety

Any new playground or any replacement of equipment or modification of components inside an existing playground shall conform to standards set forth by the American Society for Testing and Materials and the guidelines set forth by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Superintendent or designee shall have a playground safety inspector certified by the National Playground Safety Institute conduct an initial inspection to aid compliance with applicable safety standards.  (Health and Safety Code 115725)
