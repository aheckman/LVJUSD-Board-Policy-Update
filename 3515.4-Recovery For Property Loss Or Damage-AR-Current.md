## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE:  The following administrative regulation is optional and should be modified to reflect district practice.
District employees shall report any damage to or loss of school property to the Superintendent or designee immediately after such damage or loss is discovered.

CSBA NOTE: Certain acts of graffiti or vandalism may trigger the need for an investigation pursuant to the district's sexual harassment or nondiscrimination grievance procedures (e.g., graffiti that is sexual in nature or disparaging to a class of individuals protected by the district's nondiscrimination policies). See BP 5131.5 - Vandalism and Graffiti.
The Superintendent or designee shall conduct a complete investigation of any instance of damage to or loss of school property and shall consult law enforcement officials when appropriate.

When the individual causing the damage or loss has been identified and the costs of repair, replacement, or cleanup determined, the Superintendent or designee shall take all practical and reasonable steps to recover the district's costs and shall consult with the district's legal counsel and/or insurance carrier, as appropriate.

Such steps may include the filing of a civil complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover damages from the responsible person and, if the responsible person is a minor, from the parent/guardian in accordance with law. Damages may include the cost of repair or replacement of the property, the payment of any reward, interest, court costs, and all other damages as provided by law.

CSBA NOTE:  If a student's parents/guardians are unable to pay the damages, Education Code 48904 requires the district to offer an option for the student to provide work in lieu of payment. Pursuant to Education Code 49014, as added by AB 1974 (Ch. 577, Statutes of 2018), a district may offer any student or former student alternative, nonmonetary means to settle debt owed as a result of damage or loss of district property, regardless of the parents/guardians' ability to pay. However, the district is prohibited from collecting debt from a current or former homeless student or foster youth, and therefore cannot offer or require such a student to work or provide an alternative form of compensation.
If the responsible person is a minor student of the district and the student's parents/guardians are unable to pay for the damages or to return the property, the district shall offer a program of voluntary work for the student in lieu of the payment of monetary damages. The district may offer any other student or former student, with parent/guardian permission, the option to provide service, work, or other alternative, nonmonetary forms of compensation to settle the debt owed as a result of property loss or damage. Service or work exchanged for repayment of a debt shall comply with all provisions of the Labor Code related to youth employment.  (Education Code 48904, 49014)

The Superintendent or designee may withhold the student's grades, diploma, and/or transcripts until the student's parents/guardians have paid for the damages or the voluntary work has been completed. Prior to withholding a student's grades, diploma, or transcripts, due process shall be afforded the student in accordance with law.  (Education Code 48904)

In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall initiate appropriate disciplinary procedures against the student.
