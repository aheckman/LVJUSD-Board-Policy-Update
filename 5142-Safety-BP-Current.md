## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy should be modified to reflect district practice.Under the California Tort Claims Act (Government Code 810-996.6), a district may be held liable for personal injuries caused by dangerous conditions on school property and for its employees' failure to use reasonable care to prevent foreseeable injuries resulting from school activities. The court in Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified School District held that, within the scope of their employment, school staff must exercise the degree of care "which a person of ordinary prudence, charged with (comparable) duties, would exercise under the same circumstances." In J.H. v. Los Angeles Unified School District, the court held that the district had a duty to use ordinary care in supervising the after-school program.With regard to athletic activities, the court in Kahn v. East Side Union High School District held that schools have no legal duty to eliminate risks inherent in the activity itself because students are deemed to assume those risks by participating in the activity. However, schools do have a duty to exercise due care not to increase the risks over and above those inherent in the sport.
The Governing Board recognizes the importance of providing a safe school environment that is conducive to learning and promotes student safety and well-being. Appropriate measures shall be implemented to minimize the risk of harm to students, including, but not limited to, protocols for maintaining safe conditions on school grounds, promoting safe use of school facilities and equipment, and guiding student participation in educational programs and school-sponsored activities.

CSBA NOTE: 6 USC 665k, as added by the Luke and Alex School Safety Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-159), requires the creation of a Federal Clearinghouse on School Safety Evidence-Based Practices to serve as a federal resource to identify and publish online evidence-based practices and recommendations to improve school safety.
Additionally, the Superintendent or designee shall regularly review current guidance regarding cybersecurity and digital media awareness and incorporate recommended practices into the district's processes and procedures related to the protection of the district's network infrastructure, and the monitoring and response to suspicious and/or threatening digital media content.

School staff shall be responsible for the proper supervision of students at all times when students are subject to district rules, including, but not limited to, during school hours, school-sponsored activities, before and after-school programs, morning drop-off and afternoon pick-up, and while students are using district provided transportation.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that students receive appropriate instruction on topics related to safety and emergency procedures, as well as injury and disease prevention.

Crossing Guards/Student Safety Patrol

CSBA NOTE: The following section is optional. School crossing guards may be employed by the Governing Board pursuant to Education Code 45450-45451 and by cities and counties pursuant to Vehicle Code 42200 and 42201. Education Code 49300 authorizes the Board to establish a student safety patrol at any district school for the purpose of assisting students in safely crossing streets. See the accompanying administrative regulation for requirements pertaining to safety patrols.
To assist students in safely crossing streets adjacent to or near school sites, the Board may employ crossing guards and/or establish a student safety patrol at any district school. The Superintendent or designee shall periodically examine traffic patterns within school attendance areas in order to identify locations where crossing assistance may be needed.

Student Identification Cards and Safety Information

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that serve students in grades 7-12.Education Code 215.5 requires districts that issue student identification cards to have printed on either side of the card the telephone number of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) and the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233), and allows to have printed on the card the Crisis Text Line (texting HOME to 741741) and/or a local suicide prevention hotline telephone number.If, as of January 1, 2020, the district has a supply of unissued student identification cards that do not comply with the above requirements, the cards may be issued until the supply is depleted.
Student identification cards of students in grades 7-12 shall have printed on them safety information, including the following:  (Education Code 215.5)

	The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline telephone number and, at the district's discretion, the Crisis Text Line and/or a local suicide prevention hotline telephone number
	 
	The National Domestic Violence Hotline
