## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation contains parent/guardian and family engagement strategies that meet legal requirements applicable to districts and schools receiving federal Title I funds and those that do not receive Title I funds. The district should use and adapt the section(s) applicable to its circumstances. If desired, the district may develop one set of strategies applicable to all schools, provided that all the provisions required by law for both types of schools are included.
District Strategies for Title I Schools

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that receive Title I, Part A, funds. 20 USC 6318 mandates that such districts develop a policy, jointly with and agreed upon by parents/guardians and family members of participating students, that describes the means by which the district will address the components specified in items #1-6 below. Under each required component below are optional strategies for addressing the component, which should be modified to reflect the specific strategies jointly developed by the district and the parents/guardians and family members of participating students. In the state's Federal Program Monitoring process, California Department of Education (CDE) staff will check to ensure that the district has identified such strategies.
To ensure that parents/guardians and family members of students participating in Title I programs are provided with opportunities to be involved in their children's education, the district shall:

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6318, districts must involve parents/guardians and family members in the development of the Title I local educational agency (LEA) plan described in 20 USC 6312; also see BP 6171 - Title I Programs. In California, all the requirements of the LEA plan are addressed in an addendum to the local control and accountability plan (LCAP). See BP 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan for further information about the development of the LCAP, including requirements for consultation with parents/guardians and other stakeholders and for the establishment of a parent advisory committee and English learner parent advisory committee.


	Involve parents/guardians and family members in the joint development of a district plan that meets the requirements of 20 USC 6312 and in the development of school support and improvement plans pursuant to 20 USC 6311 (20 USC 6318)
	
	The Superintendent or designee may:
	 
	
		 In accordance with Education Code 52063, establish a district-level parent advisory committee and, as applicable, an English learner parent advisory committee to review and comment on the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) in accordance with the review schedule established by the Governing Board
		 
		Invite input on the plan from other district committees and school site councils
		 
		Communicate with parents/guardians through the district newsletter, web site, or other methods regarding the plan and the opportunity to provide input
		 
		Provide copies of working drafts of the plan to parents/guardians in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, in a language the parents/guardians can understand
		 
		Ensure that there is an opportunity at a public Board meeting for public comment on the plan prior to the Board's approval of the plan or revisions to the plan
		 
		Ensure that school-level policies on parent/guardian and family engagement address the role of school site councils and other parents/guardians as appropriate in the development and review of school plans
		 
	
	
	Provide coordination, technical assistance, and other support necessary to assist and build the capacity of Title I schools in planning and implementing effective parent/guardian and family engagement activities to improve student academic achievement and school performance, which may include meaningful consultation with employers, business leaders, and philanthropic organizations or individuals with expertise in effectively engaging parents/guardians and family members in education (20 USC 6318)
	
	The Superintendent or designee may:
	 
	
		Assign district personnel to serve as a liaison to the schools regarding Title I parent/guardian and family engagement issues
		 
		Identify funding and other resources, including community resources and services, that may be used to strengthen district and school parent/guardian and family engagement programs

	Conduct, with meaningful involvement of parents/guardians and family members, an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of the parent/guardian and family engagement policy in improving the academic quality of the schools served by Title I, including identification of: (20 USC 6318)
	​​​​​​​
	
		Barriers to greater participation in parent/guardian and family engagement activities, with particular attention to parents/guardians who are economically disadvantaged, are disabled, have limited English proficiency, have limited literacy, or are of any racial or ethnic minority background
		 
		The needs of parents/guardians and family members, so they can better assist with their children's learning and engage with school personnel and teachers
		 
		Strategies to support successful school and family interactions
	
	


​​​​​​​​​​​​​​The Superintendent or designee may:​​​​​​​

	Gather and monitor data regarding the number of parents/guardians and family members participating in district activities and the types of activities in which they are engaged
	 
	Recommend to the Board measures to evaluate the impact of the district's parent/guardian and family engagement efforts on student achievement


CSBA NOTE: Although it is not mandated to be included in the district's policy or regulation, the following paragraph reflects a legal requirement of Education Code 11503 pertaining to evaluation of the district's parent/guardian involvement efforts.

The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians of this review and assessment through regular school communications mechanisms and shall provide a copy of the assessment to parents/guardians upon their request. (Education Code 11503)
 


	Use the findings of the evaluation conducted pursuant to item #4 above to design evidence-based strategies for more effective parent/guardian and family involvement and, if necessary, to revise the parent/guardian and family engagement policy (20 USC 6318)
	
	The Superintendent or designee may:
	 
	
		Analyze data from the evaluation to identify parent/guardian and family engagement activities that have been successful and those activities that have had lower participation or less meaningful involvement by parents/guardians
		 
		Analyze parent/guardian and family participation to determine the level of participation by traditionally underrepresented groups
		 
		With the involvement of parents/guardians, recommend and draft proposed policy revisions to submit to the Board for consideration
		 
	
	
	Involve parents/guardians in the activities of schools served by Title I, which may include establishing a parent advisory board comprised of a sufficient number and representative group of parents/guardians or family members served by the district to adequately represent the needs of the population served by the district for the purposes of developing, revising, and reviewing the parent/guardian and family engagement policy (20 USC 6318)
	
	​​​​​​​The Superintendent or designee may:
	 
	
		Include information about school activities in district communications to parents/guardians and family members
		 
		To the extent practicable, assist schools with translation services or other accommodations needed to encourage participation of parents/guardians and family members
		 
		Establish processes to encourage parent/guardian input regarding their expectations and concerns for their children
	
	

In addition, the district shall promote the effective involvement of parents/guardians and support a partnership among the school, parents/guardians, and the community to improve student achievement by implementing the actions specified in item #7 of the section "School-Level Policies for Title I Schools" below. (20 USC 6318)

School-Level Policies for Title I Schools

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that receive federal Title I, Part A funds. 20 USC 6318 requires that each individual school receiving Title I funds have a written parent/guardian and family engagement policy, developed jointly with and agreed upon by parents/guardians and family members of participating students, that describes the means for carrying out the requirements of 20 USC 6318(c) through (f), reflected in items #1-8 below. The following section lists the required components but does not include specific strategies since those should be added by each school. Schools may also use a template available on the web site of the California Department of Education, Title I School-Level Parental Involvement Policy, to develop the school-level policy.
At each school receiving Title I funds, a written policy on parent/guardian and family engagement shall be developed jointly with the parents/guardians and family members of participating students. The school policy shall describe the means by which the school will: (20 USC 6318)

	Convene an annual meeting, at a convenient time, to which all parents/guardians of participating students shall be invited and encouraged to attend, in order to inform parents/guardians of their school's participation in Title I and to explain Title I requirements and the right of parents/guardians to be involved
	 
	Offer a flexible number of meetings, such as meetings in the morning or evening, for which related transportation, child care, and/or home visits may be provided as such services relate to parent/guardian involvement
	
	CSBA NOTE: As provided in item #3 below, 20 USC 6318 requires parent/guardian involvement in the development of the comprehensive plan required by 20 USC 6314 for schoolwide programs. Under state law (Education Code 64001), this plan must be incorporated into the school plan for student achievement covering all categorical programs in the state's consolidated application; see AR 6171 - Title I Programs and BP/AR 0420 - School Plans/Site Councils for further information about the development of this plan.
	Involve parents/guardians in an organized, ongoing, and timely way in the planning, review, and improvement of Title I programs, including the planning, review, and improvement of the school's parent/guardian and family engagement policy and, if applicable, the joint development of the plan for schoolwide programs pursuant to 20 USC 6314
	
	The school may use an existing process for involving parents/guardians in the joint planning and design of the school's programs provided that the process includes adequate representation of parents/guardians of participating students.
	 
	Provide the parents/guardians of participating students all of the following:
	 
	
		Timely information about Title I programs
		 
		A description and explanation of the school's curriculum, forms of academic assessment used to measure student progress, and the achievement levels of the state academic standards
		 
		If requested by parents/guardians, opportunities for regular meetings to formulate suggestions and to participate, as appropriate, in decisions related to their children's education. The district shall respond to any such suggestions as soon as practicably possible.
		 
	
	
	If the schoolwide program plan is not satisfactory to the parents/guardians of participating students, submit any parent/guardian comments when the school makes the plan available to the district
	
	CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6318 requires Title I schools to develop a school-parent compact as provided in item #6 below. U.S. Department of Education non-regulatory guidance, Parental Involvement: Title I, Part A, provides a sample template that schools may use in the development of the school-parent compact.
	Jointly develop with the parents/guardians of participating students a school-parent compact that outlines how parents/guardians, the entire school staff, and students will share responsibility for improved student academic achievement and the means by which the school and parents/guardians will build a partnership to help students achieve state standards
	
	This compact shall address:
	 
	
		The school's responsibility to provide high-quality curriculum and instruction in a supportive and effective learning environment that enables participating students to achieve the state's challenging academic achievement standards
		 
		Ways in which parents/guardians will be responsible for supporting their children's learning, volunteering in the classroom, and participating, as appropriate, in decisions related to their children's education and the positive use of extracurricular time
		 
		The importance of communication between teachers and parents/guardians on an ongoing basis through, at a minimum:
		 
		
			Parent-teacher conferences in elementary schools, at least annually, during which the compact shall be discussed as it relates to the student's achievement
			 
			Frequent reports to parents/guardians on their children's progress
			 
			Reasonable access to staff, opportunities to volunteer and participate in their child's classroom, and observation of classroom activities
			 
			Regular two-way, meaningful communication between family members and school staff, and, to the extent practicable, in a language that family members can understand
			 
		
		
	
	
	Promote the effective involvement of parents/guardians and support a partnership among the school, parents/guardians, and the community to improve student achievement through the following actions:
	 
	
		Assist parents/guardians in understanding such topics as the state academic standards, state and local academic assessments, the requirements of Title I, and how to monitor a child's progress and work with educators to improve the achievement of their children
		 
		Provide parents/guardians with materials and training, such as literacy training and using technology (including education about the harms of copyright piracy), as appropriate, to help them work with their children to improve their children's achievement
		 
		With the assistance of parents/guardians, educate teachers, specialized instructional support personnel, principals and other school leaders, and other staff, in the value and utility of parent/guardian contributions and in how to reach out to, communicate with, and work with parents/guardians as equal partners, implement and coordinate parent/guardian programs, and build ties between parents/guardians and the schools
		 
		To the extent feasible and appropriate, coordinate and integrate parent/guardian involvement programs and activities with other federal, state, and local programs, including public preschool programs, and conduct other activities, such as parent resource centers, that encourage and support parents/guardians in fully participating in their children's education
		 
		Ensure that information related to school and parent/guardian programs, meetings, and other activities is sent to the parents/guardians of participating students in a format and, to the extent practicable, in a language the parents/guardians can understand
		 
		Provide other such reasonable support for parent/guardian involvement activities as parents/guardians may request
		
		CSBA NOTE: Items #7a-q below are optional and should be revised to reflect district practice. Items #7a-h are authorized, but not required, by 20 USC 6318.
		In addition, the school plan may include strategies to:
		 
		
			Involve parents/guardians in the development of training for teachers, principals, and other educators to improve the effectiveness of such training
			 
			Provide necessary literacy training, using Title I funds if the district has exhausted all other reasonably available sources of funding for such training
			 
			Pay reasonable and necessary expenses associated with parent/guardian involvement activities, including transportation and child care costs, to enable parents/guardians to participate in school-related meetings and training sessions
			 
			Train parents/guardians to enhance the involvement of other parents/guardians
			 
			Arrange school meetings at a variety of times or, when parents/guardians are unable to attend such conferences, conduct in-home conferences between parents/guardians and teachers or other educators who work directly with participating students, in order to maximize parent/guardian involvement and participation
			 
			Adopt and implement model approaches to improving parent/guardian involvement
			 
			Establish a parent advisory council to provide advice on all matters related to parent/guardian involvement in Title I programs
			 
			Develop appropriate roles for community-based organizations and businesses in parent/guardian involvement activities
			 
			Make referrals to community agencies and organizations that offer literacy training, parent/guardian education programs, and/or other services that help to improve the conditions of parents/guardians and families
			 
			Provide a master calendar of district/school activities and meetings
			 
			Provide information about opportunities for parent/guardian and family engagement through the district newsletter, web site, or other written or electronic means
			 
			Engage parent-teacher organizations to actively seek out and involve parents/guardians through regular communication updates and information sessions

			Provide training and information to members of district and school site councils and advisory committees to help them fulfill their functions
			 
			Provide ongoing workshops to assist school site staff, parents/guardians, and family members in planning and implementing improvement strategies, and seek their input in developing the workshops
			 
			Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of staff development activities related to parent/guardian and family engagement
			​​​​​​​
			Include expectations for parent/guardian outreach and involvement in staff job descriptions and evaluations
			 
		
		
	
	
	To the extent practicable, provide opportunities for the informed participation of parents/guardians and family members (including parents/guardians and family members with limited English proficiency, parents/guardians and family members with disabilities, and parents/guardians and family members of migrant children), including providing information and school reports required under 20 USC 6311(h) in a format and language such parents/guardians can understand

If the school has a parent involvement policy that applies to all parents/guardians, it may amend that policy to meet the above requirements. (20 USC 6318)

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Education Code 64001 requires that the school plan for student achievement covering the categorical programs in the state's consolidated application, including Title I schoolwide programs, be annually reviewed by the school site council and submitted to the Board for approval; see BP/AR 0420 - School Plans/Site Councils.
Each school receiving Title I funds shall annually evaluate the effectiveness of its parent/guardian and family engagement policy. Such evaluation may be conducted during the process of reviewing the school plan for student achievement in accordance with Education Code 64001.

The school's policy shall be periodically updated to meet the changing needs of parents/guardians and the school. (20 USC 6318)

District Strategies for Non-Title I Schools

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that do not receive any Title I funds or that have one or more individual schools that do not receive Title I funds.
