## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional administrative regulation reflects requirements of the migrant education program established pursuant to federal Title I, Part C (20 USC 6391-6399) and Education Code 54440-54445 and should be revised to reflect the district's agreement with the regional service center.Education Code 51225.2 describes this group of highly mobile students as "a pupil who is a migratory child" and the California Department of Education's (CDE) Uniform Complaint Procedures 2023-24 Federal Program Monitoring (FPM) instrument describes this group as "students who are migratory," which is reflected in the use of this description throughout the administrative regulation. The following administrative regulation may be revised to reflect terminology preferred by the district and local community.
Eligibility

CSBA NOTE: Student eligibility for migrant education services is based on criteria delineated in 20 USC 6399 and 34 CFR 200.81. Eligibility is established through an interview conducted by a migrant education recruiter, who is employed by either the regional service center or district and has received specialized training and authorization to identify and recruit families for the migrant education program. Recruitment and identification procedures are detailed in CDE's 2017, "State Service Delivery Plan."Pursuant to 34 CFR 200.89, regional service centers are required to annually validate eligibility through the re-interview of parents/guardians of a randomly selected sample of students previously identified as migratory.
Students age 3 to 21 years shall be eligible for the district's migrant education program if they, their parents/guardians, or their spouses are migratory agricultural workers or fishers who, in the preceding 36 months, moved into the district due to economic necessity and engaged in new temporary or seasonal employment or personal subsistence in agriculture or fishing. If such employment was not secured soon after the move, students may be considered students who are migratory if the student, the student's parents/guardians, or the student's spouse actively sought such new employment and have a recent history of moves for temporary or seasonal agricultural or fishing employment.  (20 USC 6399; 34 CFR 200.81)

CSBA NOTE: The last sentence of the following paragraph should be deleted by districts that do not offer classes at the secondary level.
A student who ceases to be a student who is migratory during a school term shall be eligible for services until the end of the term. If comparable services are not available through other programs, a student who is no longer migratory may continue to receive services for one additional school year. Students who were eligible for services in secondary school may continue to be served through credit accrual programs until graduation.  (20 USC 6394)

Enrollment

A student who is migratory shall be immediately enrolled in the district even if the student:  (Education Code 48204.7)

	Has outstanding fees, fines, textbooks, or other items or monies due to the school last attended
	 
	Does not have clothing normally required by the school, such as school uniforms
	 
	Is unable to produce records normally required for enrollment, such as previous academic records, proof of residency, medical records, including, but not limited to, records or other proof of immunization history, or other documentation

If a student who is migratory experiences a change in residence, the student may remain enrolled in the school of origin for the duration of the student's status as a student who is migratory.  (Education Code 48204.7)

If a student's status as a student who is migratory changes during a school year, the Superintendent or designee shall allow the student to continue at the school of origin through the duration of that school year or, if the student is enrolled in a high school, through graduation.  (Education Code 48204.7)

A student who is migratory and is transitioning between school grade levels shall be allowed to continue in the district of origin in the same attendance area to provide the student the benefit of matriculating with peers in accordance with the established feeder patterns of school districts. A student who is migratory and is transitioning to a middle school or high school designated for matriculation in another school district shall be allowed to enroll in that school.  (Education Code 48204.7)

The Superintendent or designee shall inform a student who is migratory and the student's parent/guardian of the impact of remaining in the school of origin on the student's eligibility to receive migrant education services pursuant to Education Code 54440-54445.  (Education Code 48204.7)

The Superintendent or designee may, but is not required to, provide transportation to enable a student who is migratory to attend the school of origin, unless otherwise required by federal law, or provide programs for online instruction as a substitute for physical attendance.  (Education Code 48204.7)

Student Records

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 34 CFR 200.89, CDE and agencies operating migrant education programs must maintain a Certificate of Eligibility form and any additional documentation needed to confirm each student's eligibility.Education Code 234.7 prohibits the collection of information or documents regarding the citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members, except as required by law or to administer a state or federally supported educational program. If the district becomes aware of the citizenship or immigration status of any student, it is prohibited from disclosing that information to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. See BP/AR 5145.13 - Response to Immigration Enforcement.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records documenting the eligibility of students enrolled in the district's migrant education program. However, the district shall not collect information or documents regarding the citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members for the purpose of determining eligibility for migrant education services.

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6398 requires districts receiving migrant education funds to make student records available at no cost to another district that requests the records, if the request is made to meet the needs of a student who is migratory. State law requiring the transfer of records for all students is reflected in BP/AR 5125 - Student Records. In California, the Migrant Student Information Network, developed and maintained by WestEd, assists CDE and each regional center with data collection and reporting regarding students who are migratory. See the section "Transfer of Coursework and Credits" below for the transfer of the transcript of a high school student who is migratory.
The Superintendent or designee shall acquire education and health records from the previous school districts of a student who is migratory, as appropriate.

When a student who is migratory transfers to another district, the student's records shall be provided to the receiving district upon request at no cost in order to assist that district in meeting the needs of the student.  (20 USC 6398)

Program Components

CSBA NOTE: The following section may be revised to reflect the district's service agreement with the regional service center.
The migrant education program shall include all of the following components:  (Education Code 54443.1)

	A general needs assessment summarizing the needs of the population to be served
	 
	A comprehensive program to meet the educational, health, and related needs of participating students which supplements the district program and includes, but is not limited to:
	 
	
		Instructional services, including academic, remedial and compensatory, bilingual-crosscultural, and career technical instruction
		 
		Counseling and career education services
		 
		Preschool services in accordance with Education Code 54443
		 
		Other educational services that are not otherwise available in sufficient quantity or quality to eligible students who are migratory
		 
		The acquisition of instructional materials and equipment necessary to adequately provide the appropriate services
		 
		Other related services to meet the special needs of eligible students who are migratory to enable them to participate effectively in instructional services
		 
		The coordination and teaming of existing resources serving students who are migratory, such as bilingual-crosscultural education, health screening, and compensatory education
		 
	
	
	Individual assessment of the educational and relevant health needs of each participating student, within 30 days of enrollment, including assessments concurrently provided pursuant to compensatory education, bilingual-crosscultural education, school improvement programs, and other programs serving the student
	 
	A brief individual learning plan listing the services to be provided to each student, which shall be given to the parent/guardian in writing or at a parent/guardian conference, annually and when the student moves to a new district
	 
	Staffing and staff development plans and practices to meet the needs of students and implement the program
	 
	Parent/guardian and community involvement as specified in Education Code 54444.2, including, but not necessarily limited to, the establishment of a parent/guardian advisory council to actively involve parents/guardians in planning, operating, and evaluating the district's migrant education program
	
	CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6394 requires "the same" parent involvement in migrant education programs as is required for Title I programs for disadvantaged students (see BP/AR 6020 - Parent Involvement), unless extraordinary circumstances make such provision impractical.
	The migrant education program shall provide for the same opportunities for parent/guardian involvement that are provided to parents/guardians for federal Title I programs.  (20 USC 6394)
	 
	Evaluations which include annual student progress and overall program effectiveness and quality control reports

Summer School and Extended School Year Program

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 54444.3, each district receiving federal migrant education funding is required to conduct summer school programs for eligible students who are migratory. Before establishing the program, the district must submit an application for approval to the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The following section may be revised to reflect the grade levels offered by the district.
The district shall conduct summer school program(s) for eligible students who are migratory. The summer school program shall respond to the individual needs of participating students and shall build on and be consistent with the instructional programs offered to these students during the regular school year. Coursework shall be of the same level of difficulty in each subject as that provided to students enrolled in regular classes of instruction within the district in the preceding year.  (Education Code 54444.3)

Teachers in the summer school program shall have cultural training or background and understanding of the special needs of students who are migratory and possess the proper credential for the subjects and grade levels to which they are assigned.  (Education Code 54444.3)

The program shall comply with the following requirements for instructional time:  (Education Code 54444.3)

	For kindergarten class, a minimum of 180 minutes per day, including recesses, for not less than 20 instructional days
	 
	For grades 1-8, a minimum of 200 minutes per day, including recesses and passing time but excluding noon intermissions, for not less than 20 instructional days
	 
	For grades 7-12, a minimum of 240 minutes per day, including passing time but excluding noon intermissions, for not less than 30 instructional days

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 54444.3, holidays on which schools are required to be closed, as specified in Education Code 37220, may be deducted from the required number of teaching days. For more information regarding holidays on which schools are required to be closed, see AR 6115 - Ceremonies and Observances.
The number of instructional days may be less than as described above if, during the summer school program, there is a holiday for which schools are required to be closed.  (Education Code 37220, 54444.3).

When district facilities that are suitable for the summer climate are available, the district shall make facilities available at cost to other agencies that request facilities for the operation of migrant summer school programs, unless just cause for denial exists. When approved by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the district may jointly offer facilities with a neighboring district to meet the needs of the migrant summer school program for the entire area.  (Education Code 54444.3)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 41601.6, to mitigate lost instructional time due to family movement related to migratory agricultural employment, up to two local educational agencies may request authorization from CDE to provide an extended school year program to students who are migratory who, due to family movement, enroll in transitional kindergarten, kindergarten, or any of grades 1-6, on or after March 1 of the school year and depart on or before December 1 of the next school year, which includes the receipt of specified average daily attendance funding for such students.
If the district receives authorization and average daily attendance funding from the California Department of Education to provide an extended school year program to students who are migratory who, due to family movement, enroll in transitional kindergarten, kindergarten, or any of grades 1-6, on or after March 1 of the school year and depart on or before December 1 of the next school year,  the Superintendent or designee shall operate the program in accordance with Education Code 41601.6.  (Education Code 41601.6)

Transfer of Coursework and Credits

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts maintaining high schools. Education Code 51225.2 addresses the transferability of coursework and credits completed by a student enrolled in a migrant education program, as provided below.Education Code 51225.2 requires the transferring school to include in the student's educational record a determination of days of enrollment and/or seat time and an official transcript with full and partial credits earned, or any measure of full or partial coursework being satisfactorily completed.
When a student enrolled in a migrant education program transfers into a district school, the district will receive an official transcript from the transferring school or district which reflects full and partial credits and grades earned by the student and includes:  (Education Code 51225.2)

	A determination of the days of enrollment and/or seat time, if applicable, for all full and partial credits earned based on any measure of full or partial coursework being satisfactorily completed
	
	Partial coursework satisfactorily completed includes any portion of an individual course, even if the student did not complete the entire course
	 
	Separate listings for credits and grades earned at each school and local educational agency so it is clear where credits and grades were earned
	 
	A complete record of the student's seat time, including both period attendance and days of enrollment

The district shall transfer the credits and grades from the transferring school's transcript onto an official district transcript in the same manner as described in Item #2, above.  (Education Code 51225.2)

If the Principal or designee has knowledge that the transcript from the transferring school may not include certain credits or grades, the Principal or designee shall contact the prior school within two business days to request that the full or partial credits be issued, which shall then be issued and provided by the prior school along with all academic and other records within two business days of the request.  (Education Code 51225.2)

The district shall accept and issue full credit for any coursework that the student who is migratory has satisfactorily completed while attending another public school, a juvenile court school, a charter school, a school in a country other than the United States, or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.2, districts are not authorized to require a student who is migratory who has completed an entire course to retake the course.
If the entire course was completed, the district shall not require the student who is migratory to retake the course.  (Education Code 51225.2)

If the entire course was not completed at the previous school, the student who is migratory shall be issued partial credit for the coursework completed and shall be required to take the uncompleted portion of the course. However, the district may require the student who is migratory to retake the portion of the course completed if, in consultation with the educational rights holder for the student who is migratory, the district finds that the student who is migratory is reasonably able to complete the requirements in time to graduate from high school. Whenever partial credit is issued to a student who is migratory in any particular course, the student who is migratory shall be enrolled in the same or equivalent course, if applicable, to enable the completion of the entire course.  (Education Code 51225.2)

CSBA NOTE: Although Education Code 51225.2 requires districts to award partial credits to students who are migratory who transfer from school to school, there is no uniform system for calculating and awarding partial credits. To ensure consistency in the treatment of foster youth, the California Child Welfare Council, in its, "Partial Credit Model Policy and Practice Recommendations," available on its website, recommends the approach specified in the following optional paragraph, which may be revised to reflect district practice.
Partial credits shall be awarded on the basis of 0.5 credits for every seven class periods attended per subject. If the school is on a block schedule, each block schedule class period attended shall be equal to two regular class periods per subject. Partial credits and grades earned by a student shall be included on the student's official transcript within two business days of the district's notification of the student's transfer, as required under Education Code 49069.5.

In no event shall the district prevent a student who is migratory from taking or retaking a course to meet the eligibility requirements for admission to the California State University or the University of California.  (Education Code 51225.2)

Applicability of Graduation Requirements

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts maintaining high schools.
To obtain a high school diploma, a student who is migratory shall complete all courses required by Education Code 51225.3 and shall generally fulfill any additional local graduation requirements prescribed by the Board.

However, when a student who is migratory has completed the second year of high school and transfers into a district school, the student shall be exempted from all district-adopted coursework and other district-established graduation requirements, unless the district makes a finding that the student is reasonably able to complete the additional requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the student's fourth year of high school. Within 30 calendar days of the student's transfer, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the student and the student's parent/guardian of the availability of the exemption and whether the student qualifies for it. If the Superintendent or designee fails to provide this notification, the student shall be eligible for the exemption once notified, even if the notification occurs after the termination of the court's jurisdiction over the student.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, to determine whether a student with significant gaps in school attendance is in the third or fourth year of high school, the student's age as compared to the average age of students in the third or fourth year of high school may be used.
To determine whether a student is in the third or fourth year of high school, the district shall use either the number of credits the student has earned as of the date of the transfer, the length of school enrollment, or, for a student with significant gaps in school attendance, the student's age as compared to the average age of students in the third or fourth year of high school, whichever qualifies the student  for the exemption.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.1 requires the district to exempt a student who qualifies for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements, under the circumstances described below.
If a student who is migratory was not properly notified of an exemption, declined the exemption, or was not previously exempted, the student or the student's educational rights holder may request the exemption and the Superintendent or designee shall exempt the student within 30 days of the request. A student may request the exemption even if the student is no longer a student who is migratory.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1 the district is required to reevaluate a student's eligibility for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements, as described below.
When the Superintendent or designee determines that a student who transferred into a district school is reasonably able to complete district-established graduation requirements by the end of the student's fourth year of high school, the student shall not be exempted from those requirements. Within 30 calendar days of the following academic year, the student shall be reevaluated based on the student's course completion status at the time, to determine if the student continues to be reasonably able to complete the district-established graduation requirements in time to graduate by the end of the student's fourth year of high school. Written notice as to whether the student then qualifies for exemption shall be provided to the student, the student's educational rights holder, and if applicable, to the student's social worker or probation officer.  (Education Code 51225.1)

If, upon reevaluation, it is determined that the student who is migratory is not reasonably able to complete the district-established graduation requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the student's fourth year of high school, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the student with the option to receive an exemption from district-established graduation requirements or stay in school for a fifth year to complete the district-established graduation requirements upon agreement with the student, or if under 18 years of age, the student's educational rights holder, and shall provide notifications in accordance with Education Code 51225.1.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, the district is required to consult with a student who is migratory who is granted an exemption from district-established graduation requirements and the student's educational rights holder, as described below.
When a student who is migratory is exempted from district-established graduation requirements, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the student and the student's educational rights holder about the following:  (Education Code 51225.1)

	Discussion of how any requirements that are waived may affect the student's postsecondary education or vocation plans, including the ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution
	 
	Discussion and information about other options available to the student, including, but not limited to, a fifth year of high school, possible credit recovery, and any transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges
	 
	Consideration of the student's academic data and any other information relevant to making an informed decision on whether to accept the exemption

The district shall not require or request a student who is migratory to transfer schools in order to qualify for an exemption and shall not grant any request made by a student who is migratory or the student's parent/guardian for a transfer solely to qualify for an exemption.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.1 prohibits the district from requiring a student who is eligible for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements from accepting the exemption or being denied enrollment, as described below.
The Superintendent or designee shall not require a student who is migratory who is eligible for an exemption from district-established graduation requirements and would otherwise be entitled to remain in attendance at the school, to accept the exemption or be denied enrollment in, or the ability to complete, courses for which the student is otherwise eligible, including courses necessary to attend an institution of higher education, regardless of whether such courses are required for statewide graduation requirements.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 51225.1 prohibits the district from revoking a student's exemption from district-established graduation requirements.
If a student who is migratory is exempted from district-established graduation requirements, the exemption shall not be revoked. Additionally, the exemption shall continue to apply after the student no longer meets the definition of a student who is migratory while still enrolled in the school or if the student transfers to another school, including a charter school, or school district.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, the district may not require or request a student who is exempted from district-established graduation requirements and completes statewide coursework requirements before the end of the student's fourth year of high school to graduate early, as described below.
The Superintendent or designee shall not require or request that an eligible student who is exempted from district-established graduation requirements and who completes the statewide coursework requirements before the end of the fourth year of high school, and would otherwise be entitled to remain in school, to graduate before the end of the student's fourth year of high school.  (Education Code 51225.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, if the district determines that a student who is eligible for the exemption from district-established graduation requirements is reasonably able to complete those requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the student's fifth year, the district is required to provide the following.
Upon making a finding that a student who is migratory is reasonably able to complete district-established graduation requirements within the fifth year of high school, the Superintendent or designee shall:  (Education Code 51225.1)

	Consult with the student and, if under 18 years of age, the student's educational rights holder, of the option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the district-established graduation requirements and how that will affect the student's ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution
	 
	Consult with and provide information to the student about transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges
	 
	Upon agreement with the student or with the student's educational rights holder if under 18 years of age, permit the student to stay in school for a fifth year to complete the district-established graduation requirements

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51225.1, until January 1, 2028, when a student who is migratory  has completed the second year of high school transfers into the district or transfers between high schools within the district, and is not reasonably able to complete the district-established graduation requirements, but is reasonably able to complete the statewide coursework requirements, within the student's fifth year of high school, the district is required to exempt the student from the district-established graduation requirements and provide the student with the option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the statewide requirements. In such situations, consultation with the student and the student's educational rights holder is required, as provided below.
When a student who is migratory has completed the second year of high school transfers into the district or between high schools within the district, and the Superintendent or designee determines that the student is not reasonably able to complete the district-established graduation requirements within the student's fifth year of high school but is reasonably able to complete the statewide coursework requirements within the fifth year of high school, the student shall be exempted from all district-established graduation requirements and be provided with the option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the statewide requirements. In such situations, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the student and the student's educational rights holder, regarding the following:  (Education Code 51225.1)

	The student's option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete statewide coursework requirements
	 
	The effect of waiving the district-established requirements and remaining in school for a fifth year on the student's postsecondary education or vocation plans, including the ability to gain admission to an institution of higher education
	 
	Other options available to the student, including, but not limited to, possible credit recovery, and any transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges
	 
	The student's academic data and any other information relevant to making an informed decision on whether to accept the exemption and option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the statewide coursework requirements

Parent Advisory Council

The parent advisory council shall be comprised of members who are knowledgeable of the needs of students who are migratory and shall be elected by the parents/guardians of students enrolled in the district's migrant education program. The composition of the council shall be determined by the parents/guardians at a general meeting to which all parents/guardians of participating students shall be invited. The parents/guardians shall be informed, in a language they understand, that they have the sole authority to decide on the composition of the council.  (Education Code 54444.2)

At least two-thirds of the advisory council shall consist of parents/guardians of students who are migratory.  (Education Code 54444.2)

All parent/guardian candidates for the council shall be nominated by parents/guardians. Nonparent candidates, such as teachers, administrators, other school personnel, or students, shall be nominated by the groups they represent. All other community candidates shall be nominated by the parents/guardians.  (Education Code 54444.2)

The parent/guardian advisory council shall meet at least six times during the year and shall:  (Education Code 54444.4)

<br>
A student who is migratory and is transitioning between school grade levels shall be allowed to continue in the district of origin in the same attendance area to provide the student the benefit of matriculating with peers in accordance with the established feeder patterns of school districts. A student who is migratory and is transitioning to a middle school or high school designated for matriculation in another school district shall be allowed to enroll in that school. &nbsp;(Education Code 48204.7)<br>
