## Policy Content

The Board of Education believes that it is important for parents/guardians and community members to take an active interest in the issues affecting District schools and students. Therefore, the Board encourages interested parents/guardians and community members to visit the schools and participate in the educational program consistent with this Board policy, the accompanying administrative regulation, and any procedures established by the Superintendent or designee.

To ensure the safety of students and staff and minimize interruption of the instructional program, the Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures which facilitate visits during regular school days. Visits during school hours shall be arranged with the principal or designee. When a visit involves a conference with a teacher or the principal, an appointment should be scheduled during noninstructional time.

Any person who is not a student or staff member shall register immediately as a visitor upon entering any school building or grounds when school is in session.
The principal or designee shall provide a visible means of identification for all individuals who are not students or staff members while on school premises.

No electronic listening or recording device may be used by any person in a classroom without the teacher's and principal's permission.  (Education Code 51512)

Any visitor who is in a school building or on school grounds when school is in session shall behave in an orderly manner while on school grounds and by utilizing the District's complaint process if they have concerns with any District program or employee. In accordance with Penal Code 626.7 and Administrative Regulation 3515.2 - Disruptions, the principal or designee shall request that any individual who is causing a disruption, including exhibiting volatile, hostile, aggressive, or offensive behavior, immediately leave school grounds.

Presence of Sex Offender on Campus

Any person who is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Penal Code 290, including a parent/guardian of a District student, shall request written permission from the principal before entering the school campus or grounds, in accordance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 3515.5 - Sex Offender Notification. The principal shall report to the Superintendent or designee anytime such a request is received and notify the Superintendent or designee if permission is granted or denied. As necessary, the principal shall consult with local law enforcement authorities before allowing the presence of any such person at school or other school activity.

The principal shall indicate on the written permission the date(s) and times for which permission has been granted.  (Penal Code 626.81)
