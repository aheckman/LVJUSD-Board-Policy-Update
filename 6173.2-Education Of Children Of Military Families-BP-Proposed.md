## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that children of military families face challenges to their academic success caused by the frequent moves or deployments of their parents/guardians in fulfillment of military service. The District shall provide such students with academic resources, services, and opportunities for extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to all District students.

The Superintendent or designee may waive District policies or rules when necessary to facilitate the enrollment, placement, advancement, eligibility for extracurricular activities, or on-time graduation of children of military families, in accordance with the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children as ratified in Education Code 49700-49704.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide information and/or training to administrators, other appropriate District staff, and military families regarding the provisions of the Interstate Compact and the educational rights of children of military families.

The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with parents/guardians, school liaison officers from military installations, and/or other agencies within and outside the state to facilitate the transition of children of military families into and out of the District.

The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board and the public on the educational outcomes of children of military families. Such reports may include, but are not limited to, school attendance, student achievement test results, promotion and retention rates by grade levels, and graduation rates.
