## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following optional policy may be revised to reflect district practice. Education Code 48800-48802 and 76000-76004 authorize enrollment in community college courses as an option for a limited number of district students to benefit from advanced scholastic or career technical work. The following policy does not address requirements pertaining to early or middle college high schools established pursuant to Education Code 11300-11302. These programs provide students an opportunity to achieve two years of college credit at the same time they are earning a high school diploma, and are targeted toward student groups that historically have below-average high school and college graduation rates (e.g., low-income, at-risk, English learner, and minority students). Districts that offer such a program may revise the following policy to reflect program goals and requirements.
The Governing Board desires to provide opportunities for eligible district students to enroll concurrently in courses offered at postsecondary institutions in order to foster individual student achievement, increase opportunities for students to complete college preparatory course requirements and/or participate in career technical education (CTE), and prepare students for a smooth transition into college by providing exposure to the collegiate environment.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. Education Code 51225.3 provides that completion of postsecondary courses may be used as an alternative means of satisfying high school graduation requirements when approved by the Governing Board. See BP 6146.11 - Alternative Credits Toward Graduation. Pursuant to Education Code 48800, 76001, and 76003, a student will receive credit for community college courses that the student completes at the level determined appropriate by the Board and the governing board of the community college district.
When it is determined that the postsecondary course in which the student intends to enroll is substantially equivalent to a course provided by the district, the student may receive credit toward high school graduation requirements in addition to credit received from the college.

Approval of Concurrent Enrollment

CSBA NOTE: Although the Board may approve students for postsecondary classes in accordance with Education Code 48800 and 48800.5, the decision to admit a student into a postsecondary class rests with the college. Pursuant to Education Code 76002, a community college may restrict the admission of special part-time or full-time students based on age, completion of a specified grade level, and/or demonstrated eligibility for instruction using assessment methods and procedures approved by the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges. Education Code 76001 requires that community colleges assign a low enrollment priority to special part-time or full-time students in order to ensure that they do not displace regularly admitted students.The following optional paragraph may be revised to reflect criteria for approval established by the Board.
The Board may approve a limited number of students of any age or grade level to apply for part-time or full-time concurrent enrollment in a community college or four-year college when it is determined to be in the student's best interest and the student is adequately prepared for such coursework.

Upon recommendation of the principal and with parent/guardian consent, the Board may authorize a student to attend a community college during any session or term as a special part-time or full-time student and to undertake one or more courses of instruction offered at the community college level. (Education Code 48800)

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 48800 provides a five percent enrollment cap on the number of students at each grade level who may be recommended for community college summer session. However, this enrollment cap does not include a student who is enrolled in a college-level lower division general education course or a career technical education (CTE) course leading to a degree or certificate in the subject area, if the course meets the criteria specified in Education Code 48800. Pursuant to Education Code 48800, as amended by AB 1729 (Ch. 784, Statutes of 2019), such exceptions are operative through January 1, 2027.
Within the enrollment limits and exceptions allowed by law, the principal may recommend a student for community college summer session if that student demonstrates adequate preparation in the discipline to be studied and exhausts all opportunities to enroll in an equivalent course, if any, at the school of attendance. (Education Code 48800)

A student's parent/guardian, regardless of the student's age or grade level, may petition the Board to authorize special full-time attendance at a community college on the ground that the student would benefit from advanced scholastic or career technical work that would be available. If the petition is denied, an appeal may be filed with the County Board of Education. (Education Code 48800.5)

If the Board denies a request for special part-time or full-time enrollment at a community college for a student who is identified as highly gifted and talented, the Board shall issue its written recommendation and the reasons for the denial at its next regularly scheduled Board meeting that falls at least 30 days, but within 60 days, after the request has been submitted. (Education Code 48800, 48800.5)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for districts that offer an adult education program. Pursuant to Education Code 52620, as added by SB 554 (Ch. 528, Statutes of 2019), an adult education student pursuing a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate may be allowed to attend a community college as a special part-time student.
The Board may authorize a student who is pursuing a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate through an adult education program, upon recommendation of the administrator of the student's adult school, to attend a community college during any session or term as a special part-time student. (Education Code 52620)

College and Career Access Pathways Partnerships

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for districts that wish to establish a College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) program at one or more high schools. Education Code 76004 authorizes the Board to enter into a CCAP agreement with the governing board of a community college district for the purpose of offering or expanding dual enrollment opportunities for students who may not already be college bound or who are underrepresented in higher education. The goals of such programs are to develop seamless pathways from high school to community college for CTE or preparation for transfer, improve high school graduation rates, and/or help achieve college and career readiness. Pursuant to Education Code 76004, as amended by SB 586 (Ch. 529, Statutes of 2019), the Board must present, invite public input, and take action on the proposed agreement at an open Board meeting.As a condition of adopting a CCAP agreement which provides for CTE pathways, Education Code 76004, as amended by SB 586, requires the Board and the governing board of the community college district to consult with and consider input from the appropriate local workforce development board to determine the extent to which the pathways are aligned with regional and statewide employment needs.For further information about CCAP requirements, see the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Board may enter into a College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) partnership agreement with the board of a community college district for the purpose of offering or expanding dual enrollment opportunities for students. The agreement shall be approved at an open public Board meeting, with an opportunity for public input provided prior to the Board taking action. If the CCAP agreement provides for CTE pathways, the Board shall consult with and consider input from appropriate local workforce board(s) to determine the extent to which the pathways are aligned with regional and statewide employment needs. (Education Code 76004)

Program Evaluation

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section should be revised to reflect indicators agreed upon by the Board and Superintendent for evaluating the district's program.
The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board regarding the number and demographics of district students participating in the concurrent enrollment option, their success in completing college preparatory courses ("a-g" courses) and postsecondary courses, and any impact on their achievement in district courses and graduation rates.
