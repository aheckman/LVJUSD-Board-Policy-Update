## Policy Content

The Governing Board believes that it is important for parents/guardians and community members to take an active interest in the issues affecting district schools and students. Therefore, the Board encourages interested parents/guardians and community members to visit the schools and participate in the educational program consistent with this Board policy, the accompanying administrative regulation, and any procedures established by the Superintendent or designee.

CSBA NOTE:  In Reeves v. Rocklin Unified School District, a California Court of Appeal affirmed the district's authority to establish reasonable regulations for student safety and protection against disruptions on school campuses.
To ensure the safety of students and staff and minimize interruption of the instructional program, the Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures which facilitate visits during regular school days. Visits during school hours shall be arranged with the principal or designee. When a visit involves a conference with a teacher or the principal, an appointment should be scheduled during noninstructional time.

CSBA NOTE: Penal Code 627.2 requires "outsiders" to register upon entering school grounds during school hours. Additionally, Education Code 32212 authorizes the Governing Board to adopt policy to control classroom interruptions consistent with local circumstances; see AR 6116 - Classroom Interruptions. In addition, Education Code 35160 authorizes the Board to act in any manner not inconsistent with law. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of students and staff, a district may, in accordance with Education Code 32212, 35160 and Penal Code 627.2, require all visitors, including parents/guardians to register upon entering school campus and to comply with other reasonable requirements. It is recommended that districts consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education Legal Services or district legal counsel when requiring such registration.The Attorney General has opined, in 95 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 509 (1996), that the Board may restrict media representatives' access in the same manner as access by the general public, such as by requiring registration or accompaniment by a staff member when on school grounds. Therefore, if a district has developed a policy requiring all visitors to register upon entering school grounds, then media may be subject to the same requirements; see BP 1112 - Media Relations.
Any person who is not a student or staff member shall register immediately as a visitor upon entering any school building or grounds when school is in session.
The principal or designee shall provide a visible means of identification for all individuals who are not students or staff members while on school premises.

No electronic listening or recording device may be used by any person in a classroom without the teacher's and principal's permission.  (Education Code 51512)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35160, the Board is responsible for maintaining order in schools under its jurisdiction. Therefore, in accordance with law, the district may authorize school administrators to direct disruptive individuals to leave school grounds; see AR 3515.2 - Disruptions. Penal Code 626.7 provides that a person who is directed to leave the campus and fails to leave, or later reenters without following the school's posted registration requirements, may be guilty of a misdemeanor.The following optional paragraph should be modified to reflect district practice.
Any visitor who is in a school building or on school grounds when school is in session shall behave in an orderly manner while on school grounds and by utilizing the district's complaint process if they have concerns with any district program or employee. In accordance with Penal Code 626.7 and Administrative Regulation 3515.2 - Disruptions, the principal or designee shall request that any individual who is causing a disruption, including exhibiting volatile, hostile, aggressive, or offensive behavior, immediately leave school grounds.

Presence of Sex Offender on Campus

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Penal Code 626.81, registered sex offenders are prohibited from school buildings and grounds except for lawful business and with written permission. Penal Code 626.81 requires that the written permission indicate the date(s) for which permission is granted. It also authorizes the principal to grant permission to a registered sex offender who is not the parent/guardian of a student at the school to volunteer at the school, provided that the principal notify the parent/guardian of each student at the school at least 14 days prior to the first date for which written permission is granted ; see AR 1240-Volunteer Assistance and BP/AR 3515.5 - Sex Offender Notification.In addition, pursuant to Education Code 49091.10 and 51101, parents/guardians, including those who are required to register as sex offenders, have a prescribed right to be involved in the education of their children. Thus, the district must adopt measures that are effective in maintaining a safe school environment while avoiding a violation of the statutory rights of such parents/guardians.
Any person who is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Penal Code 290, including a parent/guardian of a district student, shall request written permission from the principal before entering the school campus or grounds, in accordance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 3515.5 - Sex Offender Notification. The principal shall report to the Superintendent or designee anytime such a request is received and notify the Superintendent or designee if permission is granted or denied. As necessary, the principal shall consult with local law enforcement authorities before allowing the presence of any such person at school or other school activity.

The principal shall indicate on the written permission the date(s) and times for which permission has been granted.  (Penal Code 626.81)
