## Policy Content

Eligibility

Students age 3 to 21 years shall be eligible for the District's migrant education program if they  meet the criteria specified in 20 USC 6399 and 34 CFR 200.81 as verified by a migrant education recruiter.(20 USC 6399; 34 CFR 200.81)

A student who ceases to be a student who is migratory during a school term shall be eligible for services until the end of the term. If comparable services are not available through other programs, a student who is no longer migratory may continue to receive services for one additional school year. Students who were eligible for services in secondary school may continue to be served through credit accrual programs until graduation.  (20 USC 6394)

Enrollment

A student who is migratory shall be immediately enrolled in the District even if the student:  (Education Code 48204.7)

	Has outstanding fees, fines, textbooks, or other items or monies due to the school last attended
	 
	Does not have clothing normally required by the school, such as school uniforms
	 
	Is unable to produce records normally required for enrollment, such as previous academic records, proof of residency, medical records, including, but not limited to, records or other proof of immunization history, or other documentation

If a student who is migratory experiences a change in residence, the student may remain enrolled in the school of origin for the duration of the student's status as a student who is migratory.  (Education Code 48204.7)

If a student's status as a student who is migratory changes during a school year, the Superintendent or designee shall allow the student to continue at the school of origin through the duration of that school year or, if the student is enrolled in a high school, through graduation.  (Education Code 48204.7)

A student who is migratory and is transitioning between school grade levels shall be allowed to continue in the District of origin in the same attendance area to provide the student the benefit of matriculating with peers in accordance with the established feeder patterns of school districts. A student who is migratory and is transitioning to a middle school or high school designated for matriculation in another school district shall be allowed to enroll in that school.  (Education Code 48204.7)

The Superintendent or designee shall inform a student who is migratory and the student's parent/guardian of the impact of remaining in the school of origin on the student's eligibility to receive migrant education services pursuant to Education Code 54440-54445.  (Education Code 48204.7)

The Superintendent or designee may, but is not required to, provide transportation to enable a student who is migratory to attend the school of origin, unless otherwise required by federal law, or provide programs for online instruction as a substitute for physical attendance.  (Education Code 48204.7)

Student Records

The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records documenting the eligibility of students enrolled in the District's migrant education program. However, the District shall not collect information or documents regarding the citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members for the purpose of determining eligibility for migrant education services.

The Superintendent or designee shall acquire education and health records from the previous school districts of a student who is migratory, as appropriate.

When a student who is migratory transfers to another district, the student's records shall be provided to the receiving district upon request at no cost in order to assist that District in meeting the needs of the student.  (20 USC 6398)

Transfer of Coursework and Credits

When a student enrolled in a migrant education program transfers into a District school, the District will receive an official transcript from the transferring school or District which reflects full and partial credits and grades earned by the student and includes:  (Education Code 51225.2)

	A determination of the days of enrollment and/or seat time, if applicable, for all full and partial credits earned based on any measure of full or partial coursework being satisfactorily completed
	
	Partial coursework satisfactorily completed includes any portion of an individual course, even if the student did not complete the entire course
	 
	Separate listings for credits and grades earned at each school and local educational agency so it is clear where credits and grades were earned
	 
	A complete record of the student's seat time, including both period attendance and days of enrollment

The District shall transfer the credits and grades from the transferring school's transcript onto an official District transcript in the same manner as described in Item #2, above.  (Education Code 51225.2)

If the Principal or designee has knowledge that the transcript from the transferring school may not include certain credits or grades, the Principal or designee shall contact the prior school within two business days to request that the full or partial credits be issued, which shall then be issued and provided by the prior school along with all academic and other records within two business days of the request.  (Education Code 51225.2)

The District shall accept and issue full credit for any coursework that the student who is migratory has satisfactorily completed while attending another public school, a juvenile court school, a charter school, a school in a country other than the United States, or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school.

If the entire course was completed, the District shall not require the student who is migratory to retake the course.  (Education Code 51225.2)

If the entire course was not completed at the previous school, the student who is migratory shall be issued partial credit for the coursework completed and shall be required to take the uncompleted portion of the course. However, the District may require the student who is migratory to retake the portion of the course completed if, in consultation with the educational rights holder for the student who is migratory, the District finds that the student who is migratory is reasonably able to complete the requirements in time to graduate from high school. Whenever partial credit is issued to a student who is migratory in any particular course, the student who is migratory shall be enrolled in the same or equivalent course, if applicable, to enable the completion of the entire course.  (Education Code 51225.2)

Partial credits shall be awarded on the basis of 0.5 credits for every seven class periods attended per subject. If the school is on a block schedule, each block schedule class period attended shall be equal to two regular class periods per subject. Partial credits and grades earned by a student shall be included on the student's official transcript within two business days of the District's notification of the student's transfer, as required under Education Code 49069.5.

In no event shall the District prevent a student who is migratory from taking or retaking a course to meet the eligibility requirements for admission to the California State University or the University of California.  (Education Code 51225.2)

Applicability of Graduation Requirements

To obtain a high school diploma, a student who is migratory shall complete all courses required by Education Code 51225.3 and shall generally fulfill any additional local graduation requirements prescribed by the Board.

However, when a student who is migratory has completed the second year of high school and transfers into a District school, the student shall be exempted from all District-adopted coursework and other District-established graduation requirements, unless the District makes a finding that the student is reasonably able to complete the additional requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the student's fourth year of high school. Within 30 calendar days of the student's transfer, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the student and the student's parent/guardian of the availability of the exemption and whether the student qualifies for it. If the Superintendent or designee fails to provide this notification, the student shall be eligible for the exemption once notified, even if the notification occurs after the termination of the court's jurisdiction over the student.  (Education Code 51225.1)

To determine whether a student is in the third or fourth year of high school, the District shall use either the number of credits the student has earned as of the date of the transfer, the length of school enrollment, or, for a student with significant gaps in school attendance, the student's age as compared to the average age of students in the third or fourth year of high school, whichever qualifies the student  for the exemption.  (Education Code 51225.1)

If a student who is migratory was not properly notified of an exemption, declined the exemption, or was not previously exempted, the student or the student's educational rights holder may request the exemption and the Superintendent or designee shall exempt the student within 30 days of the request. A student may request the exemption even if the student is no longer a student who is migratory.  (Education Code 51225.1)

When the Superintendent or designee determines that a student who transferred into a District school is reasonably able to complete District-established graduation requirements by the end of the student's fourth year of high school, the student shall not be exempted from those requirements. Within 30 calendar days of the following academic year, the student shall be reevaluated based on the student's course completion status at the time, to determine if the student continues to be reasonably able to complete the District-established graduation requirements in time to graduate by the end of the student's fourth year of high school. Written notice as to whether the student then qualifies for exemption shall be provided to the student, the student's educational rights holder, and if applicable, to the student's social worker or probation officer.  (Education Code 51225.1)

If, upon reevaluation, it is determined that the student who is migratory is not reasonably able to complete the District-established graduation requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the student's fourth year of high school, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the student with the option to receive an exemption from District-established graduation requirements or stay in school for a fifth year to complete the District-established graduation requirements upon agreement with the student, or if under 18 years of age, the student's educational rights holder, and shall provide notifications in accordance with Education Code 51225.1.  (Education Code 51225.1)

When a student who is migratory is exempted from District-established graduation requirements, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the student and the student's educational rights holder about the following:  (Education Code 51225.1)

	Discussion of how any requirements that are waived may affect the student's postsecondary education or vocation plans, including the ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution
	 
	Discussion and information about other options available to the student, including, but not limited to, a fifth year of high school, possible credit recovery, and any transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges
	 
	Consideration of the student's academic data and any other information relevant to making an informed decision on whether to accept the exemption

The District shall not require or request a student who is migratory to transfer schools in order to qualify for an exemption and shall not grant any request made by a student who is migratory or the student's parent/guardian for a transfer solely to qualify for an exemption.  (Education Code 51225.1)

The Superintendent or designee shall not require a student who is migratory who is eligible for an exemption from District-established graduation requirements and would otherwise be entitled to remain in attendance at the school, to accept the exemption or be denied enrollment in, or the ability to complete, courses for which the student is otherwise eligible, including courses necessary to attend an institution of higher education, regardless of whether such courses are required for statewide graduation requirements.  (Education Code 51225.1)

If a student who is migratory is exempted from District-established graduation requirements, the exemption shall not be revoked. Additionally, the exemption shall continue to apply after the student no longer meets the definition of a student who is migratory while still enrolled in the school or if the student transfers to another school, including a charter school, or school district.  (Education Code 51225.1)

The Superintendent or designee shall not require or request that an eligible student who is exempted from District-established graduation requirements and who completes the statewide coursework requirements before the end of the fourth year of high school, and would otherwise be entitled to remain in school, to graduate before the end of the student's fourth year of high school.  (Education Code 51225.1)

Upon making a finding that a student who is migratory is reasonably able to complete District-established graduation requirements within the fifth year of high school, the Superintendent or designee shall:  (Education Code 51225.1)

	Consult with the student and, if under 18 years of age, the student's educational rights holder, of the option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the District-established graduation requirements and how that will affect the student's ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution
	 
	Consult with and provide information to the student about transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges
	 
	Upon agreement with the student or with the student's educational rights holder if under 18 years of age, permit the student to stay in school for a fifth year to complete the District-established graduation requirements

When a student who is migratory has completed the second year of high school transfers into the District or between high schools within the District, and the Superintendent or designee determines that the student is not reasonably able to complete the District-established graduation requirements within the student's fifth year of high school but is reasonably able to complete the statewide coursework requirements within the fifth year of high school, the student shall be exempted from all District-established graduation requirements and be provided with the option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the statewide requirements. In such situations, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the student and the student's educational rights holder, regarding the following:  (Education Code 51225.1)


	The student's option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete statewide coursework requirements
	 
	The effect of waiving the District-established requirements and remaining in school for a fifth year on the student's postsecondary education or vocation plans, including the ability to gain admission to an institution of higher education
	 
	Other options available to the student, including, but not limited to, possible credit recovery, and any transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges
	 
	The student's academic data and any other information relevant to making an informed decision on whether to accept the exemption and option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the statewide coursework requirements

Notification and Complaints

Information regarding the educational rights of students who are migratory, as specified in Education Code 51225.1 and 51225.2, shall be included in the annual uniform complaint procedures notification distributed to students, parents/guardians, employees, and other interested parties pursuant to 5 CCR 4622.  (Education Code 51225.1, 51225.2)

Any complaint that the District has not complied with requirements regarding the education of students who are migratory, as specified in Education Code 51225.1 or 51225.2, may be filed in accordance with the District's procedures in Administrative Regulation 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

<br>
To obtain a high school diploma, a student who is migratory shall complete all courses required by Education Code 51225.3 and shall generally fulfill any additional local graduation requirements prescribed by the Board.<br>
<br>
However, when a student who is migratory has completed the second year of high school and transfers into a District school, the student shall be exempted from all District-adopted coursework and other District-established graduation requirements, unless the District makes a finding that the student is reasonably able to complete the additional requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the student&#39;s fourth year of high school.

Within 30 calendar days of the following academic year, the student shall be reevaluated based on the student&#39;s course completion status at the time, to determine if the student continues to be reasonably able to complete the District-established graduation requirements in time to graduate by the end of the student&#39;s fourth year of high school.

	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Discussion and information about other options available to the student, including, but not limited to, a fifth year of high school, possible credit recovery, and any transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Consideration of the student&#39;s academic data and any other information relevant to making an informed decision on whether to accept the exemption</li>
</ol>

<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall not require a student who is migratory who is eligible for an exemption from District-established graduation requirements and would otherwise be entitled to remain in attendance at the school, to accept the exemption or be denied enrollment in, or the ability to complete, courses for which the student is otherwise eligible, including courses necessary to attend an institution of higher education, regardless of whether such courses are required for statewide graduation requirements. &nbsp;(Education Code 51225.1)<br>
<br>
If a student who is migratory is exempted from District-established graduation requirements, the exemption shall not be revoked. Additionally, the exemption shall continue to apply after the student no longer meets the definition of a student who is migratory while still enrolled in the school or if the student transfers to another school, including a charter school, or school district. &nbsp;(Education Code 51225.1)<br>
<br>
The Superintendent or designee shall not require or request that an eligible student who is exempted from District-established graduation requirements and who completes the statewide coursework requirements before the end of the fourth year of high school, and would otherwise be entitled to remain in school, to graduate before the end of the student&#39;s fourth year of high school. &nbsp;(Education Code 51225.1)<br>
<br>
Upon making a finding that a student who is migratory is reasonably able to complete District-established graduation requirements within the fifth year of high school, the Superintendent or designee shall: &nbsp;(Education Code 51225.1)
<ol>
	<li>Consult with the student and, if under 18 years of age, the student&#39;s educational rights holder, of the option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the District-established graduation requirements and how that will affect the student&#39;s ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution<br>

	<li>Consult with and provide information to the student about transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Upon agreement with the student or with the student&#39;s educational rights holder if under 18 years of age, permit the student to stay in school for a fifth year to complete the District-established graduation requirements</li>
</ol>
When a student who is migratory has completed the second year of high school transfers into the District or between high schools within the District, and the Superintendent or designee determines that the student is not reasonably able to complete the District-established graduation requirements within the student&#39;s fifth year of high school but is reasonably able to complete the statewide coursework requirements within the fifth year of high school, the student shall be exempted from all District-established graduation requirements and be provided with the option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the statewide requirements. In such situations, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the student and the student&#39;s educational rights holder, regarding the following: &nbsp;(Education Code 51225.1)

<ol>
