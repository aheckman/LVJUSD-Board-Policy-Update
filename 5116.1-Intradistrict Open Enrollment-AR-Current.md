## Policy Content

Students who reside in the District will normally attend the school within their area of attendance. They also have the option of attending a school outside their attendance area on a space-available basis.
 

Parents/guardians will be notified on an annual basis of attendance options allowed by law and those available in the school District. The notice shall include programmatic options in school attendance areas, alternative schools or programs, an application form requesting a change of attendance, and a description of the appeal process available if an intradistrict transfer is denied.
 

Parents/guardians will also receive notification about the District's open enrollment period. This notification will be sent at least 45 days in advance of the intradistrict transfer window opening, per the District website.
 

Open Enrollment Conditions


	A student requesting admission during the open enrollment period shall not displace students residing within a school's attendance area.
	 
	Once a student is accepted on an intradistrict transfer, the new school becomes his/her individual homeschool Transitional Kindergarten through 5th grade. An intradistrict transfer request is required for each individual student. Student behavior issues, attendance problems, and academic expectations are handled using school and District procedures.
	 
	After finishing elementary school, students are assigned to the middle school according to their area of residence. A transfer application is required if a student wants to attend a middle school outside his/her attendance area. The same procedure is required for students going on to high school.
	 
	The Special Education Department is authorized to place students requiring a Special Day Class at any school where there is an appropriate program. Students in the Resource Specialist Program follow the same transfer guidelines as regular education students.
	 
	Waitlists created by intradistrict transfer requests expire at the end of each school year. New requests are required each year and are subject to the current guidelines.
	 
	Transportation is the responsibility of the parent or guardian, except in certain special education placements.
	 
	The transfer approval will be denied or revoked if the home address is falsified, or if the student has unsatisfactory attendance, behavior, and/or poor academic progress.


Open Enrollment Procedures


	The Superintendent/designee will annually determine capacities and space available at each school.
	 
	Timelines for the open enrollment period will be determined on an annual basis by the Director of Student Services following consultation with  Education Services Department and posted on the website at least 45 days in advance of the application window opening.
	 
	Open enrollment notification letters will be sent to parents/guardians prior to the enrollment period. A list of schools and boundary information, will be provided on the website when available.
	 
	Procedures and timelines will also be publicized through school bulletins, school newsletters, and the District's web page.
	 
	Transfer requests submitted after the 1st day of school, for the current school year, will be initiated at the student's home school. The parents/guardians shall request that the school complete the Intradistrict Transfer Form and submit it online for approval.
	Parents/guardians will be notified about transfer requests according to the timelines on the district website.
	 
	After the selection order during open enrollment is completed and the number of transfer requests exceeds the space available at a school, a lottery may be held to determine which students will be admitted.
	 
	Students not successful in the lottery will remain at their home school for placement.
	 
	A student accepted for admission during the open enrollment period cannot be displaced by a student who moves into a school attendance area following the open enrollment period.


Selection Order During Open Enrollment

The following priorities and selection order will be established in approving applications during open enrollment:


	Students living in the attendance area of the requested school who were displaced to another school the prior year.
	 
	Intradistrict transfer students with Siblings attending the school site the same year.
	If there continues to be space available and transfer applications after the students with priority have been accepted, a lottery will be held to determine the order of placement.
	 
	If there are multiple application periods, students on the waiting list during the first priority application period will have priority over students entering the waitlist during the 2nd priority application period. Students entering the waitlist during the 2nd priority application period will have priority over those entering during the next, and so on.


Transfer Requests Following the Open Enrollment Period


	Transfer requests received after the conclusion of the open enrollment period will be processed on a space-available basis. Transfers may be requested at any time during the school year.
	 
	During Open Enrollment, when a seat is available, the District will approve and process the intradistrict transfer and notify the requesting party via email of the transfer prior to the first day of school.
	 
	After the first day of school, once a seat is available, the new school will contact the requestor and confirm the transfer is still desired. If the transfer is no longer wanted, the request will be canceled.
	 
	A parent can withdraw an intradistrict transfer request by emailing the Student Services Department.


Displaced Students


	Students who are displaced from their home school because enrollment exceeds capacity have priority over transfer requests in the selection of schools.
	 
	Students who are displaced from their home school and have siblings they reside with and attend the home school during the same school year will have priority over students with no siblings currently attending the home school.
	 
	Displaced lists do not expire. Students remain on the displaced list until they are seated at their home school. If a displaced student is offered a seat at the home school and chooses to stay at their displaced school, that school becomes their home school, and they are removed from the displaced list.


Appeal Process


The parent/guardian may appeal the denial of a transfer request within 30 days to the Director of Student Services. The transfer requests that have been appealed shall be reviewed by the Director of Student Services for compliance with the procedures in this policy.​​​
