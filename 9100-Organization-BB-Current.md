## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 35143, as amended by AB 486 (Ch. 666, Statutes of 2021), the Governing Board is required to set and hold an annual organizational meeting, in the manner described below, prior to the end of each calendar year. If the Board fails to select a day and time for the meeting, the County Superintendent of Schools must designate and notify all Board members and members-elect of the day and time of the meeting. A city board of education whose members are elected in accordance with a city charter may, by a rule of its board, establish a different timeline for setting the annual meeting and revise the following paragraph accordingly.
Each year, the Governing Board shall hold an annual organizational meeting. In any year in which a regular election of district Board members is conducted, the organizational meeting shall be held within 15 days following the second Friday in December after the regular election. During all other years, the meeting may be held on any date in December, but no later than December 20th.  (Education Code 35143)

CSBA NOTE: Unless otherwise provided by rule of the Board, the following paragraph is required pursuant to Education Code 35143, as amended by AB 486.
During any year in which a regular election is conducted, the Board, at the regular meeting held immediately prior to the second Friday in December, shall select the day and time of the organizational meeting. For any other year, the day and time of the organizational meeting shall be selected at the last regular meeting held immediately before the annual meeting. On behalf of the Board, the Superintendent shall notify the County Superintendent of Schools of the day and time selected.  Within 15 days prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Superintendent shall notify in writing all Board members and members-elect of the date and time selected for the meeting.  (Education Code 35143)

CSBA NOTE: The following items should be modified to reflect district practice. Education Code 35022 requires all boards with five or more members to elect a president. Education Code 35143 requires the election of a clerk and a president for high school, union high school, and joint union high school districts. City boards of education are required to elect only a president or a president and vice president, and all other types of districts are required to elect a clerk. For more information about election of officers, see the section "Election of Officers" below.
At this meeting the Board shall:

	Elect a president and a clerk and/or vice president from its members
	 
	Appoint the Superintendent as secretary to the Board
	 
	Authorize signatures
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #4 below promotes the adoption of a Board calendar to ensure the scheduling of important governance matters such as evaluation of the Superintendent, Board self-evaluation, budget meetings, goal setting, and policy and program reviews.
	Approve a schedule of regular meetings for the year and a Board governance calendar stating the time when the Board will address important governance matters
	 
	Designate Board representatives to serve on committees or commissions of the district, other public agencies, or organizations with which the district partners or collaborates
	
	CSBA NOTE: Item #6 below is recommended by CSBA through its governance trainings, including the Masters in Governance program.
	Review and/or consider resources that define and clarify the Board's governance and leadership roles and responsibilities including, but not limited to, governance standards, meeting protocols, Board rules and bylaws, and other Board development materials

Election of Officers

CSBA NOTE: Option 1 below is for districts that rotate offices so that each Board member has the opportunity to become president, while Option 2 is for districts that each year elect their entire slate of officers. The following options should be revised to reflect the sequence of offices used in the district.
OPTION 1:  The Board shall each year elect one of its members to be (clerk)/(vice president).  This member shall be one who previously has not served in office, unless all the Board's members have previously served in office. After serving one year as (clerk)/(vice president), the elected member shall serve one year as president of the Board.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  The Board shall each year elect its entire slate of officers.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The following optional sentence may be used with Option 2.
No Board member shall serve more than ___________ consecutive year(s) in the same office.

CSBA NOTE: The following sentence may be used by all districts regardless of the option selected above. The California Attorney General has disapproved secret ballot voting in open meetings, as well as the casting of mail ballots (68 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 65, 1985). As long as they do not use secret ballots, boards may elect their officers in any way they choose.
The election of Board officers shall be conducted during an open session of the annual organizational meeting.
