## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is optional and should be revised to reflect district practice. This policy is for use by districts that wish to establish a voluntary drug testing program for the entire student population and/or a random, suspicionless drug testing program for students participating in athletics. Districts interested in establishing a suspicionless drug testing program for use in other contexts (for example, for participation in extracurricular activities) should consult legal counsel, as more extensive legal analysis of the right to privacy may be needed pursuant to California law. In Brown v. Shasta Union High School District (an unpublished opinion authored by the current Chief Justice of California), the California Court of Appeal upheld a preliminary injunction against a district's drug testing program which required students that participated in certain competitive, non-athletic extracurricular activities to be subjected to random, suspicionless drug tests. The Court found that the plaintiffs in the case were likely to prevail on their claim that the program violated the express right to privacy granted by Article 1, Section 1 of the California Constitution. Because of the complex constitutional issues involved in determining whether and how a drug testing program should be implemented, it is strongly recommended that, prior to adoption by the Governing Board, the district's proposed drug testing policy and procedures be reviewed by legal counsel. The following paragraph provides that the program will be established at the high school level, but may be revised to specify other grade levels.
The Governing Board is committed to providing a safe, drug-free school environment to maximize the health and safety of district students and to protect them from dangers associated with illegal drug use and drug abuse.  To support the district's drug abuse prevention efforts, the Board desires to establish a drug testing program in the district's high schools that will discourage illegal drug use among students and timely identify and refer drug users to appropriate counseling and rehabilitative services.

Any drug testing program to be implemented by the district shall be developed in consultation with drug treatment and prevention professionals, the laboratory contracted to conduct the tests, and district legal counsel.  In addition, the Superintendent or designee may invite input from students, staff, parents/guardians, community members, and representatives of local health care agencies, community service agencies, and businesses.

CSBA NOTE: It is important that the entire student body and parents/guardians receive full information about the drug testing program so they would be able to give informed consent before students participate.
Participation in the district's drug testing program shall require the written consent of students' parents/guardians.  The Superintendent or designee shall provide information about the program, including the district's policy and procedures, to all high school students and their parents/guardians at the beginning of each school year.  All informational materials provided for this purpose shall contain clear statements about how the program will be implemented, including, but not limited to, a list of every substance that to be tested for and how students may be withdrawn from participation in the program.

CSBA NOTE: The district should ensure that its procedures for collecting specimens from students for testing are minimally intrusive to the students' privacy and that they recognize that students are apt to be very self-conscious about their bodies at that stage of their development.
Drug testing procedures shall ensure appropriate student privacy while maintaining the viability of the process.  If urinalysis testing is used, the supervisor collecting the specimen shall be the same gender as the student and the specimen shall be collected in a private facility behind a closed stall.

Parents/guardians shall be notified after any positive test results are confirmed.  Test results shall be kept separate from the student's other educational records and shall be disclosed only to school staff designated by the Superintendent or designee as responsible for program implementation.  The district shall not release test results to law enforcement authorities except in compliance with a court order.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to principals, coaches, and other district staff involved in implementing the district's drug testing program.

Students who test positive in any voluntary drug testing program shall be encouraged to participate in an assistance program and may be required to take subsequent drug tests.  No disciplinary or punitive action shall be taken against any student who tests positive in the voluntary drug testing program.

CSBA NOTE: Though the following section is applicable only to random, suspicionless drug testing for athletics, districts that wish to have more comprehensive rules for the voluntary drug testing program may adapt items #1-3 and the last paragraph in the section below.
Random Drug Testing for Athletics

CSBA NOTE: Under this program, students would be required to submit to random drug tests as a condition of their participation in athletics.In Vernonia School District v. Acton, the U.S. Supreme Court found a random testing program for student athletes constitutional. In upholding this "suspicionless" program (i.e., probable cause or reasonable suspicion need not be established prior to the test), the court held that the district's custodial responsibility for the children entrusted to its care outweighs a student's privacy rights. Even then, districts should be aware that the California Constitution is more protective of the right to privacy than the federal constitution, and a drug testing program allowed under federal law may nevertheless violate state law.Districts should consult legal counsel as necessary.
The Superintendent or designee may establish a nonvoluntary, random drug testing program for students participating in athletics.

CSBA NOTE: The following paragraph is optional. The California Constitution prohibits districts from collecting fees for educational activities. In Hartzell v. Connell, the California Supreme Court held that fees could not be charged for "educational activities" like extracurricular activities and that such a fee would not be constitutional, even if the district policy allows the fee to be waived. Districts should consult legal counsel prior to the implementation of any fee requirement.
No fee shall be charged for student participation in the district's drug testing program.

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section is based on factors considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in upholding the district's drug testing program in Board of Education of Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls and may be modified to reflect the district's program. In addition, the following list may be adapted for use under any voluntary drug testing program.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop:

	Informational materials to be provided to participating students and their parents/guardians about the drug testing program
	
	The informational materials shall require parents/guardians to notify the school when their child is taking any medication by presenting either a copy of the prescription or a physician's written verification of this fact.
	 
	A drug testing consent form to be signed by the student and his/her parent/guardian prior to allowing the student to participate in athletics
	
	The consent form shall specify the substances to be tested for and shall clearly indicate that the consent can be withdrawn and that the only consequence for such withdrawal will be that the student will no longer be able to participate in athletics
	 
	Procedures addressing how students will be selected, how often tests will be conducted, how samples will be collected and transported, and how results will be confirmed

Any student participating in athletics who fails a required drug test shall be disqualified from participating in the athletic activity in accordance with district policy and shall be referred to an assistance program.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be adapted for use under any voluntary drug testing program.
At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct an orientation session for students participating in athletics and their parents/guardians, to explain the district's policy and outline the procedures for drug testing and the consequences if a positive result is obtained.
