## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that some students may need to take medication prescribed by an authorized healthcare provider during the school day in order to be able to attend school. The Superintendent or designee shall develop processes for the administration of medication to such students by school personnel.
 

Prescribed medication may be administered by the school nurse or other designated school personnel only when the Superintendent or designee has received written statements from both a student's authorized healthcare provider and parent/guardian. (Education Code 49423; 5 CCR 600)
 

School staff who administer medication, including epinephrine auto-injections, to students shall receive training from qualified medical personnel on how such medication should be administered as well as training in the proper documentation and storage of the medication.
 

The Board authorizes the Superintendent or designee to make available naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist for emergency medical aid to any person suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an opioid overdose. (Education Code 49414.3)
 

Staff authorized to administer the medication shall do so in accordance with administrative regulations and shall be afforded appropriate liability protection.
 

If the parent/guardian so chooses, he/she may administer the medication to his/her child. In addition, the parent/guardian may designate another individual who is not a school employee to administer the medication to the student.
 

Self-Administration and Monitoring
 

Upon written request by the parent/guardian and with the approval of the student's authorized healthcare provider, a student with a medical condition that requires frequent treatment, monitoring, or testing may be allowed to self-administer, self-monitor, and/or self-test. The student shall observe universal precautions in the handling of blood and other bodily fluids as directed by school staff, including such practices as the wearing of medical gloves, goggles, face shields, etc., as necessary.
