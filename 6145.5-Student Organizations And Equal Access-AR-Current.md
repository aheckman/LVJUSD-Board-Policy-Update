## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The extent to which a district may restrict the meetings of student organizations depends on whether a district has created a "limited open forum" authorizing noncurriculum-related groups (e.g., the bike club) to meet on school premises during noninstructional time. Pursuant to the federal Equal Access Act (20 USC 4071), if a secondary school has created a "limited open forum" and allows any noncurriculum-related group to meet, then the school must also grant equal access to all other noncurriculum-related student groups and may not discriminate against those groups on the basis of religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the group's speech. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Board of Education of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, provided the definition of "curriculum-related" as specified in items #1-4 below.Option 1 below is for use by districts that maintain a closed forum and thus do not allow any noncurriculum-related student group to meet on school grounds. Such districts should also select Option 1 in the accompanying Board policy.
OPTION 1: (Closed Forum)

In order to maintain a closed forum at district schools, each principal or designee shall ensure that all school-sponsored student organizations are curriculum-related.  In order to qualify as "curriculum-related," a student group shall meet one or more of the following criteria: 
 

	 The subject matter of the group is currently taught or will be taught in a regularly scheduled course.
	 
	The subject matter of the group concerns the body of courses as a whole (e.g., student government).
	 
	Participation in the group is required for a particular course.
	 
	Participation in the group results in academic credit.


OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2: (Limited Open Forum)

CSBA NOTE: Option 2 below reflects the provisions of the federal Equal Access Act (20 USC 4071-4074) and court interpretations. If a school authorizes any noncurriculum-related group to meet on school premises during noninstructional time, it is deemed to have created a limited open forum under the Equal Access Act, even if the Board has not officially established such a forum. Districts selection this option should also select Option 2 in the accompanying Board policy.
Because the district has established a limited open forum, the principal or designee shall not deny any student-initiated school group access to school facilities during noninstructional time on the basis of religious, political, philosophical, or any other content of speech to be addressed at such meetings.  (20 USC 4071)

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this section applies only to districts that have established a limited open forum.Pursuant to 20 USC 4072, noninstructional time is defined as the time set aside by the school before actual classroom instruction begins or after actual classroom instruction ends. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Ceniceros v. Board of Trustees of the San Diego Unified School District held that a high school's lunch period constituted noninstructional time based on the fact that classroom instruction did not occur during the lunch period and that students were not required to remain on campus. The court concluded that schools could disallow religious groups from using school premises for meetings during lunch only if they barred all noncurriculum-related groups from meeting at lunch. Option 1 below allows meetings during the lunch period; Option 2 prohibits meetings during the lunch period.
Such meetings shall not interfere with regular school activities.  The Superintendent or designee shall identify the noninstructional time period(s) set aside for meetings of student groups either before or after actual classroom instruction times.

OPTION 1:  Meetings may also be held during the lunch period.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2:  Meetings shall not be held during the lunch period.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

Meetings held within the limited open forum shall entail no expenditure of public funds beyond the incidental cost of providing the meeting space.  (20 USC 4071)

Students shall leave the meeting place in a clean, orderly, and secure condition after their meetings.  The Superintendent or designee may deny the use of facilities to any group that he/she believes will materially disrupt the school program or threaten the health and safety of students and staff.  (20 USC 4071)

Authorization for Student Groups

CSBA NOTE: The remainder of this regulation applies to districts that selected either Option 1 (closed forum) or Option 2 (limited open forum) above.Pursuant to 20 USC 4072, although districts may not "sponsor" the meetings of a noncurriculum-related student group, districts do retain the ability to maintain order and discipline on school premises. In Prince v. Jacoby, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a district policy which granted staff limited approval and oversight ability over a noncurriculum-related student group was not impermissibly "sponsoring" the group as prohibited by 20 USC 4071.The following optional section creates a process for district authorization, but not sponsorship, of curriculum-related and noncurriculum-related student groups. Districts that wish to create a formal sponsorship of curriculum-related student groups should modify the following paragraph accordingly and should consult legal counsel to ensure that, if additional school resources are given to such groups, equal access requirements are not violated.
Any student wishing to create either a curriculum- or noncurriculum-related student group shall first request authorization from the principal or designee.  The group shall provide the principal or designee with the following information:
 

	Name of the organization and names of student contacts
	 
	A statement of the organization's purposes, objectives, and activities
	 
	A copy of the proposed bylaws of the student group, including a description of how officers will be selected, as well as the bylaws of any off-campus organization with which the group may be affiliated
	 
	The name of the proposed faculty advisor, if any
	 
	The proposed dates, times, and location of meetings
	 
	Any special equipment to be used
	 
	A description of the qualifications for membership, if any
	 
	If a curriculum-related group, a statement of the relation of the club to the curriculum and/or instructional program


The principal or designee may establish school rules governing the meetings of curriculum-related groups, such as attendance or grade requirements.  Such rules may vary depending on the group, such as whether or not academic credit is given for participation in the group.

Role of Staff Adviser

CSBA NOTE:  Because curriculum-related groups have a direct relationship to the district, such groups are subject to greater control and an increased role for the staff adviser.
For any curriculum-related student group, the staff adviser shall provide guidance and teaching to students to ensure that the group's activities are aligned to the district's goals and objectives and shall provide supervision and leadership of the group. The principal shall have final authority in determining the assignment and role of the staff adviser.

For noncurriculum-related student groups, a staff adviser may be assigned voluntarily to observe meetings for purposes of maintaining order and protecting student safety.  Staff advisers and other school employees shall not promote, lead, or participate in the meetings.  (20 USC 4071, 4072)

A school employee may refuse to attend a meeting of a student group if the content of the speech at the meeting is contrary to the employee's beliefs. (20 USC 4071)

Hazing

CSBA NOTE:  Pursuant to Education Code 48900, as amended by SB 132 (Ch. 730, Statutes of 2007), a student may be suspended or expelled for engaging in "hazing," as defined below. See AR 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process.
Any student who engages in hazing may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, suspension or expulsion.  Hazing means a method of initiation or pre-initiation into a student organization or body, whether or not the organization or body is officially recognized by the district, which is likely to cause serious bodily injury or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm to a former, current, or prospective student.  (Education Code 48900)
