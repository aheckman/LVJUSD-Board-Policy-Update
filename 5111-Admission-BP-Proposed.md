## Policy Content

The Board of Education encourages the enrollment and appropriate placement of all children who are eligible for enrollment in school. The Superintendent or designee shall inform parents/guardians of children seeking admission to a District school about admission requirements and shall assist them with enrollment procedures.

The Superintendent or designee shall announce and publicize the timeline and process for registration of students at District schools. Applications for intradistrict or interdistrict enrollment shall be subject to the timelines specified in applicable Board policies and administrative regulations.

All appropriate staff shall receive training on District admission policies and procedures, including information regarding the types of documentation that can and cannot be requested.

Verification of Admission Eligibility

Before enrolling any child in a District school, the Superintendent or designee shall verify the child's age, residence within the District, immunization, and other applicable eligibility criteria specified in law, the accompanying administrative regulation, or other applicable Board policy or administrative regulation.

The District shall not inquire into or request documentation of a student's social security number or the last four digits of the social security number or the citizenship or immigration status of the student or the student's family members.  (Education Code 234.7, 49076.7)

However, such information may be collected when required by state or federal law or to comply with requirements for special state or federal programs. In any such situation, the information shall be collected separately from the school enrollment process and the Superintendent or designee shall explain the limited purpose for which the information is collected. Enrollment in a District school shall not be denied on the basis of any such information of the student or the student's parents/guardians obtained by the District, or the student's or parent/guardian's refusal to provide such information to the District.

School registration information shall list all possible means of documenting a child's age for entry into TK and grades K-1 as authorized by Education Code 48002 or otherwise prescribed by the Board. Any alternative document allowed by the District shall be one that all persons can obtain regardless of immigration status, citizenship status, or national origin and shall not reveal information related to citizenship or immigrant status.

The Superintendent or designee shall immediately enroll a homeless student, foster youth, student who has had contact with the juvenile justice system, or a child of a military family regardless of outstanding fees or fines owed to the student's last school, lack of clothing normally required by the school, such as school uniforms, or an inability to produce previous academic, medical, or other records normally required for enrollment.  (Education Code 48645.5, 48850, 48852.7, 48853.5, 49701; 42 USC 11432)
