## Policy Content

The Governing Board recognizes that parents/guardians of district students have certain rights as well as responsibilities related to the education of their children.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 51101, each Board is mandated to adopt policy, jointly developed with parents/guardians, that outlines how parents/guardians, school staff and students may share the responsibility for continuing the intellectual, physical, emotional and social development and well-being of students at each school site. Such policy must include the following components: (1) the means by which the school and parents/guardians may help students achieve academic and other standards of the school; (2) a description of the school's responsibility to provide a high-quality curriculum and instructional program in a supportive and effective learning environment that enables all students to meet the academic expectations of the school; and (3) the manner in which parents/guardians may support the learning environment of their children, including, but not limited to, the responsibilities as detailed in the accompanying administrative regulation.As added by SB 1595 (Ch. 1037, Statutes of 2002), Education Code 51101.1 specifies that parents/guardians who are not fluent in English must be able to exercise all rights pursuant to Education Code 51101 and grants additional rights for parents/guardians of English learners. See the accompanying administrative regulation.The district should revise the following section to reflect local policy developed in conjunction with parents/guardians.
The Board believes that the education of the district's students is a shared responsibility. The Superintendent or designee shall work with parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English learners, to determine appropriate roles and responsibilities of parents/guardians, school staff and students for continuing the intellectual, physical, emotional and social development and well-being of students at each school site, including the means by which the schools and parents/guardians can help students achieve academic and other standards of the school.

Within this framework, the school's primary responsibility shall be to provide a high-quality curriculum and instructional program in a supportive and effective learning environment that enables all students to meet the academic expectations of the school.

Parents/guardians shall have the opportunity to work with schools in a mutually supportive and respectful partnership and to help their children succeed in school.   (Education Code 51100)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that district staff understand the rights of parents/guardians afforded by law and Board policy and follow acceptable practices that respect those rights.

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that parents/guardians receive notification regarding their rights in accordance with law.

CSBA NOTE: As added by SB 1595 (Ch. 1037, Statutes of 2002), Education Code 51101.1 requires the district to take all reasonable steps to ensure that parents/guardians of English language learners are notified in English and in their home language pursuant to Education Code 48985. Education Code 48985 provides that when 15 percent or more of students enrolled in a school speak a single primary language other than English, all notices and reports sent to the parents/guardians of these students must also be written in the primary language and may be answered by the parent/guardian in either language.
The Superintendent or designee shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all parents/guardians who speak a language other than English are properly notified in English, and in their home language of the rights and opportunities available to them pursuant to Education Code 48985.  (Education Code 51101.1)
CSBA NOTE: Note: Education Code 51101.1, as added by SB 1595 (Ch. 1037, Statutes of 2002), encourages those districts with a substantial number of English learners to establish parent centers with personnel who can communicate with the parents/guardians and to encourage their participation in the district's educational programs.
