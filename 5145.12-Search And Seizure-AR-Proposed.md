## Policy Content

Use of Metal Detectors

The following procedures shall be followed when making metal detector scans:


	Before walk-through, students shall be asked to empty their pockets of metallic objects.
	 
	If an initial activation occurs, students shall be asked to remove other metallic objects they may be wearing (e.g., belt and jewelry) and to walk through a second time.
	 
	If a second activation occurs, a hand-held metal detector shall be used.
	 
	If the activation is not eliminated or explained, staff shall escort the student to a private area.
	 
	In the private area, an expanded search, which should be as limited as possible consistent with the objective of preventing or deterring the presence of weapons on school grounds, shall be conducted by a trained staff member of the same gender as the student, in the presence of another District employee. Any expanded search, such as a request to open purses or backpacks or empty pockets, shall be limited to the detection of weapons.
	 
	The search shall be limited to the detection of the cause of the activation. If during the search, another illegal substance or article is in plain sight, the school may assert jurisdiction over the student for its possession.


Use of Contraband-Detection Dogs

Contraband detection dogs shall not be used in classrooms or other District facilities when the rooms are occupied, except for demonstration purposes, with the handler present. When used for demonstration purposes, the dog shall be separated from the students and not allowed to sniff any individual.

Prior to conducting an inspection, students shall be asked to leave the room that will be subject to the canine sniff. No student shall be forced to leave personal items behind for inspection, unless school officials have reasonable suspicion to search the item.

Only the dog's official handler shall determine what constitutes an alert by the dog. If the dog alerts on a particular item or place, the student having the use of that item or place, or responsibility for it, shall be called to witness the inspection. If a dog alerts on a locked vehicle, the student who brought the vehicle onto District property shall be asked to unlock it for inspection.

Use of Breathalyzers or Similar Devices

The following procedures shall be followed prior to and during testing for alcohol by breathalyzers or similar devices designed for the detection of alcohol ingestion:


	The District shall purchase devices for the detection of alcohol ingestion which have a reputation for accuracy and reliability after checking with local law enforcement agencies and/or other appropriate resources.
	 
	The devices shall be maintained and calibrated in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
	 
	Access to and use of the devices shall only be by sworn law enforcement personnel or certificated District employees who have been trained and certified in the proper operation of the devices with such certification records maintained by the District.
	 
	The devices shall be kept under lock and key when not in use with access permitted only to sworn law enforcement personnel or certificated District employees who have been trained and certified in the proper operation of the devices, who shall sign for units identified by serial number or other distinguishing designations. The District shall maintain the sign-in sheets.
	 
	Only certified personnel in teams of two shall use the devices to conduct tests on students in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
	 
	In the event of a positive reading showing the ingestion of alcohol, the student shall be afforded an opportunity to provide an explanation for the result and given the choice of a second testing after ten minutes have elapsed.
	 
	If the testing team determines that the student has ingested alcohol, his or her parent or guardian shall be contacted to pick up the student and appropriate discipline to follow. Under no circumstances will a student testing positive for alcohol consumption be allowed to leave alone or with other students.


Notifications

At the beginning of each school year and upon enrollment, the Superintendent or designee shall inform students and parents/guardians about the District's policies and procedures for searches, including notice regarding:


	The possibility of random searches of students, their belongings, their vehicles parked on District property, and District properties under a student's control, including lockers or desks
	 
	The District's contraband dog detection program
	 
	The use of metal detector scans
	 
	The use of breathalyzers


In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that signs are posted at all schools at which metal detectors, contraband detection dogs, and breathalyzers are to be used to explain that anyone may be scanned by metal detector for guns, knives, other illegal weapons, or drugs or alcohol when on campus or attending athletic or extracurricular events.
