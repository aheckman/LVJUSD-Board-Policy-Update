## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 1412 and 34 CFR 300.101, a student with disabilities must be provided with special education and related services identified in the student's individualized education program (IEP). 34 CFR 300.34 defines "related services" to include school health and school nurse services. Whether a specific medical service needed by a student with disabilities must be provided by the district, at the district's expense, is a fact-specific analysis. Districts with questions should consult with legal counsel.
Definitions

Specialized physical health services means those health services prescribed by the student's licensed physician requiring medically related training for the individual who performs the services and which are necessary during the school day to enable the student to attend school.  These services include catheterization, gastric tube feeding, suctioning, or other services that require medically related training.  (Education Code 49423.5; 5 CCR 3051.12)

Qualified means the ability to demonstrate competence in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, current knowledge of community emergency medical resources, and skill in the use of equipment and performance of techniques necessary to provide specialized physical health care services for individuals with disabilities.  In addition, for designated school personnel, qualified means trained in the procedures to a level of competence and safety which meets the objectives of the training as provided by the school nurse, public health nurse, licensed physician, or other programs which provide the training. (Education Code 49423.5; 5 CCR 3051.12)

Training means preparation in the appropriate delivery and skillful performance of specialized physical health care services.  (5 CCR 3051.12)

Supervision means review, observation, and/or instruction of a designated school person's performance and of physical health care services, but does not necessarily require the immediate presence of the supervisor at all times.  (5 CCR 3051.12)
