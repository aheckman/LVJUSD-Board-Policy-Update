## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following policy is for use by districts that receive funding through Title I, Part A, of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (20 USC 6311-6322), which supports basic programs designed to improve the academic achievement of economically disadvantaged students. 20 USC 6313 establishes school eligibility criteria and priorities for funding. Title I funds received by the district must be allocated to eligible schools or eligible school attendance areas, in rank order, on the basis of the number of students from low-income families.
The Governing Board desires to provide a high-quality education that enables all students to meet challenging state academic standards. In schools with a large number or percentage of economically disadvantaged families, the district shall use Title I funds to provide services that strengthen the academic program and provide support to students at risk of failing to achieve academic standards.

Title I funds shall be used to supplement, not supplant, funds available from state and local sources for the education of students participating in Title I programs.  (20 USC 6314, 6321)

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6312 requires that districts receiving Title I funds develop a local educational agency (LEA) plan with specified components. In California, districts have the option of addressing each LEA plan provision within the local control and accountability plan (LCAP), the LCAP Federal Addendum, or another document, provided that the location of each provision is referenced within the LCAP Federal Addendum. A template for the LCAP Federal Addendum is available on the California Department of Education's (CDE) web site.Title I schoolwide programs are required to develop school-level comprehensive plans addressing the components listed in 20 USC 6314; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
Descriptions of how the district will address the required components of the Title I local educational agency plan, as specified in 20 USC 6312, shall be included within the district's control and accountability plan (LCAP), the LCAP Federal Addendum, or another document. School-level strategies shall be aligned with the district's plan and be tailored to the specific needs of the students at the school.

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6318 mandates each district and each school receiving Title I funds to have a written parent/guardian and family engagement policy developed jointly with and agreed upon by parents/guardians of participating students. See BP/AR 6020 - Parent Involvement for language fulfilling this mandate.
In addition, the district and each school receiving Title I funds shall develop a written parent/guardian and family engagement policy in accordance with 20 USC 6318.

Comparability of Services

CSBA NOTE: 20 USC 6321 mandates any district receiving Title I funds to develop procedures to ensure compliance with legal requirements regarding comparability of services. Pursuant to 20 USC 6321, requirements regarding comparability do not apply to districts that do not have more than one building for each grade span.
In schools receiving Title I funds, state and local funds shall be used to provide services that, taken as a whole, are at least comparable to services in schools that are not receiving Title I funds or, if all district schools are receiving Title I funds, that are substantially comparable in each school. Comparability may be determined on a school-by-school basis or by grade span.  (20 USC 6321)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to 20 USC 6321, a district will be considered to have met the legal requirement for comparability if it provides the CDE with written assurances that it has established and implemented (1) a districtwide salary schedule; (2) a policy ensuring equivalence among schools in teachers, administrators, and other staff; and (3) a policy ensuring equivalence among schools in the provision of curriculum materials and instructional supplies. The district must keep records documenting that the salary schedule and policies were actually implemented and that they resulted in equivalence among schools in staffing, materials, and supplies. Items #1-4 below reflect methods of determining comparability authorized by the CDE. For further information, see the CDE's guidance Meeting Title I, Part A Comparability Requirements, available on its web site.
To demonstrate comparability of services among district schools, the district shall:
 

	Adopt and implement a districtwide salary schedule
	
	CSBA NOTE: Items #2a and b below reflect methods authorized by the CDE to determine comparability of staffing, and may be revised to reflect district practice.
	Ensure equivalence in teachers, administrators, and other staff, as measured by either or both of the following:
	 
	
		The ratio of students to instructional staff at each Title I school within a grade span, which shall not exceed 110 percent of the average ratio for all non-Title I district schools within that grade span
		 
		Salary expenditures for instructional staff at each Title I school, which shall be no less than 90 percent of the average salary expenditure across non-Title I district schools.
		 
	
	
	Ensure equivalence in the provision of curriculum materials and instructional supplies, by determining whether the per-student expenditure of state and local funds for curriculum materials and instructional supplies in Title I schools is between 90 and 110 percent of the district wide average
	 
	Determine whether the amount of state and local funds allocated per student for each grade span is between 90 and 110 percent of the per student average for each grade span in non-Title I schools


In determining comparability, the district shall not include staff salary differentials for years of employment. The district also may exclude unpredictable changes in student enrollment or personnel assignments that occur after the beginning of the school year, state and local funds expended for language instruction educational programs, state and local funds expended for the excess costs of providing services to students with disabilities, and supplemental state or local funds expended in any school attendance area or school for programs that specifically meet the intent and purposes of Title I.  (20 USC 6321)

CSBA NOTE: Although 20 USC 6321 requires records of compliance to be updated biennially, U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) nonregulatory guidance, Title I Fiscal Issues, clarifies that because Title I allocations are made annually, demonstrating comparability is an annual requirement. CDE requires districts to complete and submit their comparability reports each fall. Districts with schools that fail the initial comparability test are given additional time to resolve the issues and resubmit their report with supporting documentation in the winter.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually assess comparability in accordance with the above criteria and maintain records documenting the district's compliance.  If any instances of noncomparability are identified, the Superintendent or designee shall promptly implement adjustments as needed to ensure comparability.

Participation of Private School Students

The district shall provide or contract to provide special educational services, instructional services (including evaluations to determine the progress being made in meeting students' academic needs), counseling, mentoring, one-on-one tutoring, or other Title I benefits to eligible private school students residing in a participating school attendance area. Such services and benefits shall be provided on an equitable basis in comparison to services and other benefits for public school students.  (20 USC 6320, 7881)

Program Evaluation

CSBA NOTE: The following section may be revised to reflect district practice. During the Federal Program Monitoring process, the CDE will review whether the district monitors the effectiveness of district plans to help low-achieving students meet challenging academic achievement standards and revises those plans as necessary.20 USC 6311 requires each state to have an accountability system that incorporates multiple measures, including, but not limited to, statewide assessment results for all students as well as numerically significant student subgroups. California's accountability system (the California School Dashboard) consists of both state and local indicators to assist districts in identifying strengths and areas in need of improvement in each priority area addressed by the LCAP. Beginning in the 2018-19 school year, CDE will notify schools identified for comprehensive and/or targeted support and improvement pursuant to 20 USC 6311. See BP 0500 - Accountability.
The Board shall regularly monitor the progress of economically disadvantaged and low-achieving students in Title I schools. During the annual evaluation of the district's progress toward achieving each goal identified in the LCAP or other planning document addressing 20 USC 6312, the Board shall review disaggregated data on academic achievement, school attendance, and other outcomes for such students and shall ensure that strategies are revised as necessary to support continuous improvement.

Districts with schools that fail the initial comparability test are given additional time to resolve the issues and resubmit their report with supporting documentation in the winter.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MzEyMA6" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MzEyMA6%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22IMw205%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1573681912%2C%22text%22%3A%22Although%2020%20USC%206321%20requires%20records%20of%20compliance%20to%20be%20updated%20biennially%2C%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Education%20%28USDOE%29%20nonregulatory%20guidance%2C%20Title%20I%20Fiscal%20Issues%2C%20clarifies%20that%20because%20Title%20I%20allocations%20are%20made%20annually%2C%20demonstrating%20comparability%20is%20an%20annual%20requirement.%20CDE%20requires%20districts%20to%20complete%20and%20submit%20their%20comparability%20reports%20each%20fall.%20Districts%20with%20schools%20that%20fail%20the%20initial%20comparability%20test%20are%20given%20additional%20time%20to%20resolve%20the%20issues%20and%20resubmit%20their%20report%20with%20supporting%20documentation%20in%20the%20winter.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MzEyMA6" title="CSBA NOTE: Although 20 USC 6321 requires records o..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
