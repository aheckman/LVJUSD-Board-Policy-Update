## Policy Content

The Superintendent or designee shall inform teachers of the District's policy regarding grading, including expectations that grades shall be based on factors that directly measure students' knowledge and skills in the content area and shall not include nonacademic factors.

Report cards displaying students' grades in each subject or course shall be distributed to parents/guardians at the end of each grading period. Parents/guardians shall be offered an opportunity to meet with their child's teacher(s) to discuss the grades and strategies to improve their child's performance.

Whenever it becomes evident to a teacher that a student is in danger of failing a course, the teacher shall arrange a conference with the student's parent/guardian or send the parent/guardian a written report. (Education Code 49067)

For each student in grades 9-12, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain a transcript recording the courses taken, the term that each course was taken, credits earned, final grades, and date of graduation.

Grades for Academic Performance

Because of the more rigorous nature of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, honors, and concurrent postsecondary courses, students receiving a grade of A, B, or C in those courses shall receive extra grade weighting as follows:
 

	
		
			
			A
			
			(90-100%)
			Outstanding Achievement
			5.0 grade points
		
		
			
			B
			
			(80-89%)
			Above Average Achievement
			4.0 grade points
		
		
			
			C
			
			(70-79%)
			Average Achievement
			3.0 grade points
		
	


Grades for Physical Education

No grade of a student participating in a physical education class may be adversely affected due to the fact that the student, because of circumstances beyond his/her control, does not wear standardized physical education apparel. (Education Code 49066)

Student performance in high school physical education courses shall be based upon evaluation of the student's individual progress, attainment of goals in each instructional area, tests designed to determine skill and knowledge, and physical performance tests. (5 CCR 10060)

High school students using interscholastic athletic participation to fulfill physical education requirements, as authorized by Education Code 51242, may be graded on this participation provided a teacher credentialed to teach physical education supervises this participation and assigns the grade.

Grades for College Courses

When the District has approved a student to receive District credit for coursework completed at a community college or four-year college, he/she shall receive the same letter grade as is granted by the college.

Pass/Fail Grading

The Superintendent or designee may identify courses or programs for which students may, with parent/guardian permission, elect to earn a Pass or Fail grade instead of a letter grade.

Students who receive a Pass grade shall acquire the appropriate semester units of credit for the course. The grade shall not be counted in determining class rank, honors list, or membership in the California Scholarship Federation. Students who receive a Fail grade shall not receive credit for taking the course.

Peer Grading

At their discretion, teachers may use peer grading of student tests, papers, and assignments as appropriate to reinforce lessons.

Repeating Classes

With the approval of the principal or designee, a student may repeat a course in order to raise his/her grade. Both grades received shall be entered on the student's transcript, but the student shall receive credit only once for taking the course. The highest grade received shall be used in determining the student's overall grade point average (GPA).

Withdrawal from Classes

A student who drops a course during the first six weeks of the grading period may do so without any entry on his/her permanent record card. A student who drops a course after the first six weeks of the grading period shall receive an F grade on his/her permanent record, unless otherwise decided by the principal or designee because of extenuating circumstances.

Effect of Absences on Grades

Teachers who choose to withhold class credit because of excessive unexcused absences shall so inform students and parents/guardians of such a possibility at the beginning of the school year or semester. When a student reaches the number of unexcused absences defined as excessive in Board policy, the student and parent/guardian shall again be notified of the District's policy regarding excessive unexcused absences.

The student and parent/guardian shall have a reasonable opportunity to explain the absences. (Education Code 49067)

If a student receives a failing grade because of excessive unexcused absences, the student's record shall specify that the grade was assigned because of excessive unexcused absences. (Education Code 49067)

Grades for a student in foster care shall not be lowered if the student is absent for any reason specified in Education Code 49069.5.

Grade Point Average

The Superintendent or designee shall calculate each student's GPA using the grade point assigned to each letter grade in accordance with the scale described in the section "Grades for Academic Performance" above. The grade points for all applicable coursework shall be totaled and divided by the number of courses completed. Pass/Fail grades shall not be included in the determination of a student's GPA.

When plus and minus designations are added to letter grades, they shall not be considered in determining GPA.

Each academic year, the Superintendent or designee shall provide to the Student Aid Commission the GPA of all District students in grade 12, except for students who have opted out or are permitted by the rules of the Student Aid Commission to provide test scores in lieu of the GPA. (Education Code 69432.9)
