## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes the importance of regular school attendance in promoting student achievement. However, the Board also recognizes that, in rare circumstances, it may be beneficial for a student to participate in opportunities outside the school which contribute to his/her educational experience.

Upon request, the Superintendent or designee may grant student leaves of absence in accordance with law for the purpose of supervised travel, study, training, or work not available to the student under another educational option. Such leave may be granted to a student 15 years of age or older in the regular program and to a student between the ages of 16 and 18 in the continuation program.

No more than one percent of the students enrolled and attending a school shall be granted a leave of absence during any school year. (Education Code 48232, 48416)

When feasible, students shall be encouraged to instead enroll in the District's independent study program to allow for greater contact and coordination with District staff.
