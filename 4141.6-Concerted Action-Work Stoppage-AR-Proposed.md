Activities of Employees

The District shall not impose or threaten to impose reprisals, discriminate or threaten to discriminate, or otherwise interfere with, restrain or coerce employees for the exercise of their rights.  (Government Code 3543.5-3543.6)

Employees engaging in a work stoppage shall not prevent access to school facilities by other employees, substitutes or students; use or threaten physical violence or bodily injury; trespass; distribute malicious or defamatory leaflets or materials; or otherwise coerce or intimidate individuals in the conduct of school business.

During an actual or threatened work stoppage, an employee shall not retain any District property, including but not limited to student attendance and grading records, lesson plans, keys, equipment and supplies.

Employees shall not use students to distribute messages that promote or explain the position of any employee organization that is contemplating or engaged in a work stoppage.  In addition, employees shall not use classroom or other duty time to promote an employee organization's position in negotiations or in a work stoppage.

When students raise questions related to a work stoppage, teachers shall approach the subject in accordance with the District's policy on controversial issues and shall not allow such discussions to interfere with their regular teaching responsibilities. 

Salary and Benefits

Employees withholding services shall not receive salary or unemployment benefits during the period of the work stoppage.

Any employee withholding services may be subject to the loss of payroll deduction privileges.

Throughout the duration of any enrolled employee’s participation in an authorized strike, the District shall not fail or refuse to maintain and pay for the employee’s continued health care or other medical coverage or the coverage of their enrolled dependents, nor shall the District fail to collect and remit the employee’s contributions to any such coverage.  The District shall maintain the coverage at the same level and under the same conditions that the coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued to work in the employee's position for the duration of the strike.  Health care or other medical coverage for this purpose includes coverage for medical, dental, vision, behavioral health, disability, accidental death and dismemberment, life, and supplemental health insurance benefits.  (Government Code 3141-3142)

“Authorized strike” means a strike sanctioned by the central labor council or the membership of an employee organization that represents the striking employees, or one that is engaged in by unrepresented employees.  (Government Code 3141)

Employees whose vacation leave has been authorized prior to the work stoppage shall receive vacation pay for the authorized period.

If an employee is on a paid sick or disability leave when the work stoppage begins, the employee shall be entitled to continued payment as long as the employee remains ill or disabled and is otherwise eligible according to Board policy and collective bargaining agreements.

The Superintendent or designee may determine that credit shall not be applied toward probationary service, salary schedule advancement, permanent status, vacation earnings, retirement credit or sick leave accrual during the period of time that employees withhold services.
