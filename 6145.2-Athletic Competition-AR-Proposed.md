Nondiscrimination and Equivalent Opportunities in the Athletic Program

No student shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be denied equivalent opportunity in, or otherwise be discriminated against in interscholastic, intramural, or club athletics on the basis of any actual or perceived characteristic specified in law and Board Policy 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities.  (Education Code 220, 221.5, 230 5 CCR 4920, 34 CFR 106.41)

The Superintendent or designee may provide single-sex teams when selection for the teams is based on competitive skills.  (5 CCR 4921; 34 CFR 106.41)

Each student shall be allowed to participate in any single-sex athletic program or activity consistent with the student's gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the student's records, for which the student is otherwise eligible to participate.  (Education Code 221.5)

When a school provides only one team in a particular sport for members of one sex, but provides no team in the same sport for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities in the total program for that sex have been previously limited, members of the excluded sex shall be allowed to try out and compete with the team. The same standards for eligibility shall be applied to every student trying out for the team, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or other protected group status.  (5 CCR 4921; 34 CFR 106.41)

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that equivalent opportunities are available to both sexes in athletic programs by considering, among other factors:  (5 CCR 4922; 34 CFR 106.41)

	Whether the offered selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of both sexes
	
	The athletic program may be found to effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of both sexes using any one of the following tests:  (Education Code 230, 5 CCR 4922)
	 
	
		Whether the interscholastic-level participation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments
		 
		Where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among interscholastic athletes, whether the District can show a history and a continuing practice of program expansion that is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the members of that sex
		 
		Where the members of one sex are underrepresented among interscholastic athletes and the District cannot show a history and continuing practice of program expansion as required in Item #1b above, whether the District can demonstrate that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program
		 
	
	
	The provision and maintenance of equipment and supplies
	 
	Scheduling of games and practice times, selection of the season for a sport, and location of the games and practices

	The total enrollment of the school, classified by gender
	 
	The number of students enrolled at the school who participate in competitive athletics, classified by gender
	 
	The number of boys' and girls' teams, classified by sport and by competition level

The materials used to compile this information shall be retained by the school for at least three years after the information is posted on the website.  (Education Code 221.9)

Concussions and Head Injuries

The Superintendent or designee shall annually distribute to student athletes and their parents/guardians an information sheet on concussions and head injuries. The student and parent/guardian shall sign and return the information sheet before the student initiates practice or competition.  (Education Code 49475)

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to coaches and/or athletic trainers regarding the signs and symptoms of, and the appropriate response to, concussions.  (Education Code 35179.1, 49032)

If a student athlete is suspected of sustaining a concussion or head injury in an athletic activity, the student shall be immediately removed from the activity for the remainder of the day. The student shall not be permitted to return to the activity until the student is evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the management of concussions and receives the health care provider's written clearance to return to the activity. If the health care provider determines that the student sustained a concussion or a head injury, the student shall also complete a graduated return-to-play protocol of no less than seven days in duration under the supervision of a licensed health care provider.  (Education Code 49475)

A middle school or high school football team shall not hold a full-contact practice during the off-season and shall not conduct more than two full-contact practices per week during the preseason and regular season (from 30 days before the commencement of the regular season until the completion of the final interscholastic football game of that season). In addition, the full-contact portion of a practice shall not exceed 90 minutes in any single day. For these purposes, full-contact practice means a practice where drills or live action is conducted that involves collisions at game speed, where players execute tackles and other activity that is typical of an actual tackle football game.  (Education Code 35179.5)

Heat Illness

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to coaches and/or athletic trainers regarding the signs and symptoms of, and the appropriate response to, heat illness, including heat cramps, heat syncope, heat exhaustion, and exertional heat stroke.  (Education Code 35179.1, 49032)

The Superintendent or designee shall distribute the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) information sheet on sudden cardiac arrest to all student athletes who will be participating in a CIF-governed athletic activity and to their parents/guardians. The student and parent/guardian shall sign and return the information sheet prior to the student's participation in the athletic activity. If an athletic activity is not covered by CIF, the student and parent/guardian shall, prior to the student's participation in the athletic activity, sign and return an acknowledgement that they have received and reviewed the sudden cardiac arrest information posted on the California Department of Education's website.  (Education Code 33479.2, 33479.3)

The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to coaches and/or athletic trainers regarding the signs and symptoms of, and the appropriate response to, sudden cardiac arrest.  (Education Code 33479.6, 33479.7, 35179.1, 49032)

If a student athlete passes out or faints, or is known to have passed out or fainted, while participating in or immediately following participation in an athletic activity, the student shall be removed from participation at that time. If a student exhibits any other symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest, including seizures during exercise, unexplained shortness of breath, chest pains, dizziness, racing heart rate, or extreme fatigue, the student may be removed from participation by a coach or other employee who observes these symptoms. If any such symptoms are observed, notification shall be given to the student's parent/guardian so that the parent/guardian can determine the treatment, if any, the student should seek. A student who has been removed from participation shall not be permitted to return until the student is evaluated and given written clearance to return to participation by a health care provider.  (Education Code 33479.2, 33479.5)

Automated External Defibrillators

The Superintendent or designee shall acquire at least one automated external defibrillator (AED) for each District school that participates in any interscholastic athletic program and shall make the AED(s) available to coaches, athletic trainers, and/or other authorized persons at athletic activities or events for the purpose of providing emergency care or treatment to students, spectators, and other individuals in attendance at the athletic program's on-campus activities and events.  (Education Code 35179.6)

The District shall comply with all requirements of Health and Safety Code 1797.196 pertaining to any AED acquired by the District, including, but not limited to, regular maintenance and testing of the AED, and the provision and posting of information regarding the location of any AED and proper use of the AED.  (Education Code 35179.6; Health and Safety Code 1797.196)

Before students participate in practice or competition as part of interscholastic athletic activities, the Superintendent or designee shall, in addition to providing the students and their parents/guardians with the notices described above, send a notice to the students and their parents/guardians which:

	Contains information about the procedures for filing a discrimination complaint that arises out of an interscholastic athletic activity, including the name of the District's Compliance Officer/Title IX Coordinator
