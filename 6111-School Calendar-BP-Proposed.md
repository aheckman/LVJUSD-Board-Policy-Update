## Policy Content

For each District school, the Board of Education shall adopt a school calendar that meets the requirements of law as well as the needs of the community, students, and the work year as negotiated with the District's employee organization(s). As appropriate, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the proposed calendar is aligned with assessment and accountability schedules in order to support the District's goals for student achievement.

Each school calendar shall show the beginning and ending school dates, legal and local holidays, staff development days, orientation days, minimum days, vacation periods, and other pertinent dates.

The District shall offer a minimum of 175 days of instruction per school year, until it equals or exceeds the local control funding formula target established for it pursuant to Education Code 42238.02, at which time it shall offer 180 days or more of instruction per school year.  (Education Code 41420, 46208)

Staff development days shall not be counted as instructional days.

Notification of the schedule of minimum days and student-free staff development days shall be sent to all parents/guardians at the beginning of the school year.  If any minimum days or student-free staff development days are added to the schedule, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians of the affected students as soon as possible and at least one month before the scheduled minimum day.  (Education Code 48980)

If a school will be used as a polling place on an election day, the Board shall determine whether to continue school in session, designate the day for staff training and development, or close the school to students and nonclassified staff.  (Elections Code 12283)
