## Policy Content

Hazardous substance means a substance, material, or mixture which is likely to cause illness or injury by reason of being explosive, flammable, poisonous, corrosive, oxidizing, an irritant, or otherwise harmful.  Hazardous substances, as identified by the Department of Industrial Relations, are listed in 8 CCR 339.  (8 CCR 339, 5161)

Storage and Disposal of Chemicals

The Superintendent or designee shall adopt measures to ensure that hazardous substances on any District property are stored and disposed of properly in accordance with law.  Such measures shall include, but are not limited to, the following:  (8 CCR 5164)


	Substances which react violently or evolve toxic vapors or gases when mixed, or which in combination become toxic, flammable, explosive, or otherwise hazardous, shall be separated from each other in storage by distance, partitions, secondary containment, or otherwise so as to preclude accidental contact between them.
	 
	Hazardous substances shall be stored in containers which are chemically inert to and appropriate for the type and quantity of the hazardous substance.
	 
	Containers of hazardous substances shall not be stored in such locations or manner as to result in physical damage to or deterioration of the container or where they are exposed to heat sufficient to rupture the container or to cause leakage.
	 
	Containers used to package a substance which gives off toxic, poisonous, corrosive, asphyxiant, suffocant, or anesthetic fumes, gases, or vapors in hazardous amounts, excluding small quantities of such materials kept in closed containers or materials kept in tank cars or trucks, shall not be stored in locations where it could be reasonably anticipated that persons would be exposed.

The Superintendent or designee shall regularly remove and dispose of all chemicals whose estimated shelf life has elapsed.  (Education Code 49411)

Hazard Communication Program

The District's written hazard communication program shall include at least the components listed below and shall be available upon request to all employees and their designated representatives.  The program shall apply to any hazardous substance which is known to be present in the workplace in such a manner that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a reasonably foreseeable emergency resulting from workplace operations. (8 CCR 5194)


	Container Labeling
	
	No container of hazardous substance, unless exempted by law, shall be accepted by the District or any District school unless labeled, tagged, or marked by the supplier with the identity of the hazardous substance, hazard warning statements, and the name and address of the chemical manufacturer or importer. No label on an incoming container shall be removed or intentionally defaced unless the container is immediately marked with the required information.
	
	Whenever hazardous substances are transferred from their original containers to other containers, the secondary containers shall likewise be labeled with the identity and hazard warning statement, unless the substances are intended only for the immediate use of the employee who performs the transfer.
	 
	Safety Data Sheets
	
	Upon receiving a hazardous substance or mixture, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the manufacturer or importer has furnished a safety data sheet (SDS) as required by law. If the SDS is missing or obviously incomplete, the Superintendent or designee shall, within seven working days of noting the missing or incomplete information, request a new SDS from the manufacturer or importer. If a response is not received within 25 working days, the Superintendent or designee shall send a copy of the District's written inquiry to the California Occupational Safety and Health Division (Cal/OSHA). (8 CCR 5194)
	
	The Superintendent or designee shall maintain the required SDS for each hazardous substance in the workplace and shall ensure that it is readily accessible to employees in their work area during working hours. The SDS may be maintained in paper copy, electronically, or through other means, provided that employees have immediate access and understand how to use the alternative system.
	 
	Employee Information and Training
	
	Employees shall receive information and training on hazardous substances in their work area at the time of their initial assignment and whenever a new hazard is introduced into their work area.  The information and training shall include, but are not limited to, the following topics:  (8 CCR 5194)
	 
	
		The requirements of 8 CCR 5194, including employee rights described therein
		 
		The location and availability of the District's written hazard communication program, including the list of hazardous materials and all SDS
		 
		Any operations in the work area where hazardous substances are present
		 
		The physical and health effects of the hazardous substances in the work area
		 
		Methods and observations that may be used to detect the presence or release of hazardous substances in the work area
		 
		Measures that employees can take to protect themselves from exposure to hazardous substances, including specific procedures the District has implemented to protect employees, such as appropriate work practices, emergency procedures, and personal protective equipment to be used
		 
		How to read and use the labels and SDS
		 
	
	
	List of Hazardous Substances
	
	The written hazard communication program shall include a list of the hazardous substances known to be present in the workplace as a whole or for individual work areas.  (8 CCR 5194)
	 
	Hazardous Nonroutine Tasks
	
	When employees are required to perform hazardous nonroutine tasks or to work on unlabeled pipes that contain hazards, they shall first receive information about the specific hazards to which they may be exposed during this activity and the protective/safety measures which must be used, such as ventilation, respirators, other personal protective equipment, and/or the presence of another employee.  They shall also receive information about emergency procedures to follow if accidentally exposed to the hazardous substance.
	 
	Information to Contractors


To ensure that outside contractors and their employees work safely in District facilities, the Superintendent or designee shall inform contractors of hazardous substances which are present on the site and precautions that they may take to lessen the possibility of exposure.  It shall be the contractor's responsibility to disseminate this information to his/her employees and subcontractors.

Chemical Hygiene Plan

The District's chemical hygiene plan shall address exposure to hazardous chemicals in school laboratories and shall include the following components:  (8 CCR 5191)


	Standard operating procedures relevant to safety and health considerations to be followed when laboratory work involves the use of hazardous chemicals
	 
	Criteria that the District will use to determine and implement control measures to reduce exposure to hazardous chemicals, including engineering controls, the use of personal protective equipment, and hygiene practices
	 
	A requirement that protective equipment comply with state regulations and that specific measures be taken to ensure proper and adequate performance of such equipment
	 
	Provision of specified information at the time of an employee's initial assignment to a work area where hazardous chemicals are present and prior to assignments involving new exposure situations
	 
	Provision of specified employee training in accordance with the schedule determined by the Superintendent or designee
	 
	The circumstances under which a particular laboratory operation, procedure, or activity shall require prior approval of the Superintendent or designee before implementation
	 
	Provisions for medical consultations and examinations whenever there is evidence, as specified, that the employee may have been exposed to a hazardous chemical
	 
	Designation of an employee, who is qualified by training or experience, to serve as the District's chemical hygiene officer to provide technical guidance in the development and implementation of the chemical hygiene plan
	 
	Provisions for additional employee protection for work with particularly hazardous substances, as specified

The plan shall be readily available to employees and employee representatives, and, upon request, to Cal/OSHA.  (8 CCR 5191)

The Superintendent or designee shall review and evaluate the effectiveness of the chemical hygiene plan at least annually and shall update it as necessary.  (8 CCR 5191)
