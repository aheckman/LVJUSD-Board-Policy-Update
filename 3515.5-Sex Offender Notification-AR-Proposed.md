	Any staff member who receives information directly from law enforcement regarding registered sex offenders shall immediately contact the Superintendent or District liaison in order to help ensure that the District is able to respond appropriately
	 
	If an identified sex offender is seen on or near school grounds or around any child, staff shall immediately contact the District liaison, who shall inform local law enforcement accordingly

Notification to Parents/Guardians

When law enforcement has determined that parents/guardians should be notified regarding the presence of a sex offender in the community, the Superintendent or District liaison shall collaborate with local law enforcement in order to determine an appropriate response. This response may include:

	An article in a school or parent council newsletter notifying parents/guardians that law enforcement information about registered sex offenders is available at the local law enforcement agency headquarters and/or at the school office
	 
	A mailing, at law enforcement's expense, prepared by law enforcement, and printed on law enforcement letterhead and envelopes, notifying parents/guardians of the presence of registered sex offenders
	 
	A mailing of a letter, at District expense, prepared by law enforcement and printed on law enforcement letterhead and envelopes, notifying parents/guardians of the presence of registered sex offenders

The article and mailings listed above shall encourage parents/guardians to contact local law enforcement and access the DOJ's Megan's Law website for additional information.

Whenever the principal has granted permission to a person who is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Penal Code 290 to come into a school building or upon school grounds to volunteer at the school, the principal or designee shall notify the parent/guardian of each student at that school, at least 14 days in advance, that a registered sex offender has been granted such permission, the date(s) and times for which permission has been granted, and the parent/guardian's right to obtain information regarding the person from a designated law enforcement agency. This notice shall be provided by regular mail or any other method normally used by the District to communicate with parents/guardians in writing. If a parent/guardian requests such notice in electronic format, the District shall provide electronic notice.  (Education Code 48985, Penal Code 626.81)
