## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Districts that have recognized a bargaining unit of supervisory employees as authorized by Government Code 3545 (see BP 4140/4240/4340 - Bargaining Units) may choose to triple code this Board policy as BP 4143/4243/4343 - Negotiations/Consultation.
The Governing Board recognizes its responsibility to represent the public's interests in the collective bargaining process. In ratifying agreements on employee contracts, the Board shall balance the needs of staff and the priorities of the district in order to provide students with a high-quality instructional program based on a sound, realistic budget.

The Board and the Superintendent shall establish a bargaining team to assist in analyzing contract provisions and conducting contract negotiations. The Board shall provide its negotiator(s) with expected outcomes and clear parameters for acceptable contract provisions which promote the realization of district goals and priorities.

The Board and its bargaining team shall negotiate in good faith with exclusive employee representatives on wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of employment identified in law as being within the scope of representation. (Government Code 3543.2)

CSBA NOTE: As amended by AB 1611 (Ch. 801, Statutes of 2014), Government Code 3543.2 requires advance "reasonable written notice" to the exclusive employee representative whenever the district intends to make any change to matters within the scope of representation of the exclusive representative. This amendment to law is consistent with previous decisions by the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB).
When the district intends to make any change to matters within the scope of representation, it shall give reasonable written notice of its intent to the exclusive representative for the purpose of providing the exclusive representative a reasonable amount of time to negotiate with the district regarding the proposed changes.  (Government Code 3543.2)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3543.1, a reasonable number of employees must be granted paid released time during the work day to participate in negotiations. In such cases, the employee is compensated by the district. This released time is distinct from the time off allowed pursuant to Education Code 44987 and 45210 for employees to serve as elected officers of their local, statewide, or national employee organization, which is reimbursed by the employee organization, except as negotiated otherwise for classified bargaining units; see AR 4161.2/4261.2/4361.2 - Personal Leaves.
A reasonable number of representatives of the employee organization shall have the right to receive reasonable periods of released time without loss of district compensation when meeting and negotiating and/or for the processing of grievances.  (Government Code 3543.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 54957.6, the Governing Board may meet in closed session to review its position and/or instruct its designated representative regarding salaries, salary schedules, or benefits or to discuss any other matter within the statutorily provided scope of representation for both represented and unrepresented groups. Government Code 3549.1 specifies that closed sessions may be held for (1) any meeting and negotiating discussion between the district and employee organization; (2) any meeting of a mediator with either party or both parties; (3) any hearing, meeting, or investigation conducted by a factfinder or arbitrator; and (4) an executive session of the district or between the district and its designated representative to discuss its position regarding any matter within the scope of representation and instructing its designated representatives. See BB 9321 - Closed Session Purposes and Agendas. Closed sessions properly conducted pursuant to Government Code 3549.1 are exempt from the Brown Act.
The Board and its bargaining team shall establish standards of conduct pertaining to the negotiations process for members of the bargaining team. Certain meetings related to negotiations shall not be open to the public in accordance with Government Code 3549.1 and 54957.6, except as otherwise required by law. Matters discussed in these meetings shall be kept in strict confidence in accordance with law.

The Board and its negotiator(s) shall not knowingly provide the employee organization with inaccurate information regarding the financial resources of the district.  (Government Code 3543.5)

The Board shall monitor the progress of negotiations and carefully consider how proposed contract provisions would affect the district's short- and long-term fiscal, programmatic, instructional, and personnel goals.

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 3547 and 3547.5 require the Board and exclusive representative, at public meetings, to present their initial contract proposals before commencing negotiations and to make public the major provisions of the proposed agreement before entering into such agreement; see BP 4143.1/4243.1 - Public Notice - Personnel Negotiations.
The Board and/or Superintendent or designee shall keep the public informed about the progress of negotiations and the ways in which negotiations may affect district goals unless otherwise agreed upon by the district and exclusive representative.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3540.2, if the district has a qualified or negative certification on an interim fiscal report, indicating that it may not or will not be able to meet its financial obligations for the current or subsequent fiscal years (see AR 3460 - Financial Reports and Accountability), it must allow the county office of education 10 working days to review and comment on any proposed collective bargaining agreement. During that time, the County Superintendent of Schools will notify the Superintendent, Board, and each parent-teacher organization of the district if, in his/her opinion, the proposed agreement would endanger the fiscal well-being of the district.
Whenever the district has a qualified or negative certification on an interim fiscal report, it shall allow the county office of education at least 10 working days to review and comment on any proposed agreement with exclusive representatives of employees. The district shall provide the County Superintendent of Schools with all information relevant to gain an understanding of the financial impact of any final collective bargaining agreement. (Government Code 3540.2)

Once the final terms of the agreement have been ratified by the membership of the employee organization, the contract shall be presented to the Board at a public meeting for acceptance.

Any agreement adopted by the Board may be for a term not to exceed three years. (Government Code 3540.1)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3548, if the district and employee organization are unable to reach agreement, either party may declare an impasse and request assistance from PERB in instituting mediation procedures in accordance with Government Code 3548-3548.8.
In the event of an impasse in negotiations, the district shall participate in good faith in mediation and fact-finding procedures pursuant to Government Code 3548-3548.8.  (Government Code 3543.5)

Following adoption of the collective bargaining agreement, any subsequent amendments shall be executed in writing and ratified by the Board and the employees' exclusive representative.

Consultation

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Government Code 3543.2, the exclusive representative of certificated personnel has the right to consult with the Board on matters specified below; all other matters are reserved to the Board. PERB has determined that consultation procedures are a mandatory subject of bargaining. Although required to consult on these matters, the Board should address the matters in policies and regulations rather than incorporating them into the negotiated agreement.
The exclusive representative of certificated staff may consult with the Board on the definition of educational objectives, the determination of the content of courses and curriculum, and the selection of textbooks.
