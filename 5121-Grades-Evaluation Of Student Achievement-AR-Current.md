## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49067 mandates the Governing Board to approve regulations requiring the evaluation of each student's academic performance for each grading period. The following administrative regulation should be revised to reflect district practice and the grade levels offered by the district.
The Superintendent or designee shall inform teachers of the district's policy regarding grading, including expectations that grades shall be based on factors that directly measure students' knowledge and skills in the content area and shall not include nonacademic factors.

Report cards displaying students' grades in each subject or course shall be distributed to parents/guardians at the end of each grading period. Parents/guardians shall be offered an opportunity to meet with their child's teacher(s) to discuss the grades and strategies to improve their child's performance.

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 49067 mandates that the Board approve regulations requiring either a conference with the parent/guardian or a written report sent to the parent/guardian whenever a student is in danger of failing a course. Pursuant to Education Code 49067, the refusal of a parent/guardian to attend the conference or to respond to the written report shall not preclude failing the student at the end of the grading period.
Whenever it becomes evident to a teacher that a student is in danger of failing a course, the teacher shall arrange a conference with the student's parent/guardian or send the parent/guardian a written report. (Education Code 49067)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that maintain high schools.
For each student in grades 9-12, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain a transcript recording the courses taken, the term that each course was taken, credits earned, final grades, and date of graduation.

Grades for Academic Performance

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section may be revised to reflect district practice.
For grades K-3, students' level of progress for each grading period shall be reported as follows:

O         Outstanding
S          Satisfactory
N         Needs Improvement

CSBA NOTE: The following list may be revised to include plus and minus signs if used by the district.
For grades 4-12, grades for academic performance shall be reported for each grading period as follows:

A         (90-100%)       Outstanding Achievement      4.0 grade points
B         (80-89%)         Above Average Achievement 3.0 grade points
C         (70-79%)         Average Achievement 2.0 grade points
D         (60-69%)         Below Average Achievement 1.0 grade points
F          (0-59%)           Little or No Achievement       0 grade points
I                                   Incomplete                              0 grade points

An Incomplete shall be given only when a student's work is not finished by the end of the grading period because of illness or other excused absence. If not made up within six weeks, the Incomplete shall become an F.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that maintain high schools and choose to assign extra grade weighting to Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, honors, or concurrent postsecondary courses.Districts should be aware that, in determining college admissions eligibility, the extra grade weighting will be factored into university admissions only if the courses have been certified as honors courses by the University of California and are in the following "a-g" subjects: history-social science, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, language other than English, and visual and performing arts.
Because of the more rigorous nature of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, honors, and concurrent postsecondary courses, students receiving a grade of A, B, or C in those courses shall receive extra grade weighting as follows:

A         (90-100%)       Outstanding Achievement       5.0 grade points
B         (80-89%)         Above Average Achievement  4.0 grade points
C         (70-79%)         Average Achievement             3.0 grade points

Grades for Physical Education

No grade of a student participating in a physical education class may be adversely affected due to the fact that the student, because of circumstances beyond his/her control, does not wear standardized physical education apparel. (Education Code 49066)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is for use by districts that maintain high schools and may be revised to reflect additional grade levels at the district's discretion. 5 CCR 10060 lists criteria by which districts must appraise the quality of high school physical education programs, including criteria for reporting student achievement in physical education.
Student performance in high school physical education courses shall be based upon evaluation of the student's individual progress, attainment of goals in each instructional area, tests designed to determine skill and knowledge, and physical performance tests. (5 CCR 10060)

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph may be used by districts that allow high school students to fulfill physical education credits through interscholastic athletics carried on wholly or partially after regular school hours pursuant to Education Code 51242; see BP 6142.7 - Physical Education and Activity.
High school students using interscholastic athletic participation to fulfill physical education requirements, as authorized by Education Code 51242, may be graded on this participation provided a teacher credentialed to teach physical education supervises this participation and assigns the grade.

Grades for College Courses

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts maintaining grades 9-12 that choose to grant district credit for completion of postsecondary courses pursuant to Education Code 48800-48802 and 76000-76002; see BP/AR 6172.1 - Concurrent Enrollment in College Classes.
When the district has approved a student to receive district credit for coursework completed at a community college or four-year college, he/she shall receive the same letter grade as is granted by the college.

Grades for Citizenship and Work Habits

CSBA NOTE: In Las Virgenes Educators Association v. Las Virgenes Unified School District, the court determined that a citizenship mark is a "grade" within the meaning of Education Code 49066 and upheld a teacher's right to make the final decision regarding a citizenship mark.
Any grades assigned for citizenship or work habits, such as effort or study skills, shall be reported as follows:

O         Outstanding
S          Satisfactory
N         Needs Improvement

Pass/Fail Grading

CSBA NOTE: The district may choose to expand the following optional section to identify specific courses or programs for which students may elect a Pass/Fail grade rather than an A-F grade (e.g., alternative education program, non-college-preparatory summer school courses, etc.).
The Superintendent or designee may identify courses or programs for which students may, with parent/guardian permission, elect to earn a Pass or Fail grade instead of a letter grade.

Students who receive a Pass grade shall acquire the appropriate semester units of credit for the course. The grade shall not be counted in determining class rank, honors list, or membership in the California Scholarship Federation. Students who receive a Fail grade shall not receive credit for taking the course.

Peer Grading

CSBA NOTE: In Owasso Independent School District v. Falvo, the U.S. Supreme Court held that students' grades on assignments and tests are not "education records" until the teacher records them, and therefore the practice of peer grading does not violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) (20 USC 1232g); see BP/AR 5125 - Student Records. Furthermore, for the same reason, the Supreme Court did not prohibit the practice of having students report the grades aloud so that the teacher may record them. The following section is optional.
At their discretion, teachers may use peer grading of student tests, papers, and assignments as appropriate to reinforce lessons.

Repeating Classes

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts that maintain high schools. Districts may adopt a different approach than the one described below, such as the use of averaging.
With the approval of the principal or designee, a student may repeat a course in order to raise his/her grade. Both grades received shall be entered on the student's transcript, but the student shall receive credit only once for taking the course. The highest grade received shall be used in determining the student's overall grade point average (GPA).

Withdrawal from Classes

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section is for use by districts maintaining high schools and should be revised to reflect district practice.
A student who drops a course during the first six weeks of the grading period may do so without any entry on his/her permanent record card. A student who drops a course after the first six weeks of the grading period shall receive an F grade on his/her permanent record, unless otherwise decided by the principal or designee because of extenuating circumstances.

Effect of Absences on Grades

CSBA NOTE: The following section is for use by districts that choose to authorize teachers to assign failing grades to students who have excessive unexcused absences pursuant to Education Code 49067; see the accompanying Board policy. Education Code 49067 mandates such districts to establish regulations which include, but are not limited to, providing (1) a reasonable opportunity for students or parents/guardians to explain the absences and (2) a method for identifying in a student's record the failing grades assigned on the basis of unexcused absences.
Teachers who choose to withhold class credit because of excessive unexcused absences shall so inform students and parents/guardians of such a possibility at the beginning of the school year or semester. When a student reaches the number of unexcused absences defined as excessive in Board policy, the student and parent/guardian shall again be notified of the district's policy regarding excessive unexcused absences.

The student and parent/guardian shall have a reasonable opportunity to explain the absences. (Education Code 49067)

If a student receives a failing grade because of excessive unexcused absences, the student's record shall specify that the grade was assigned because of excessive unexcused absences. (Education Code 49067)

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 49069.5, grades for a student in foster care shall not be lowered if the student is absent from school due to (1) a decision by a court or placement agency to change the student's placement, in which case the student's grades and credits shall be calculated as of the date the student left school, or (2) a verified court appearance or related court-ordered activity. See BP 6173.1 - Education for Foster Youth.
Grades for a student in foster care shall not be lowered if the student is absent for any reason specified in Education Code 49069.5.

Grade Point Average

CSBA NOTE: The following optional section should be revised to reflect the district's methodology for calculating GPA. Districts may calculate multiple GPAs for a single student (e.g., academic GPA, total GPA) for different purposes (e.g., eligibility for extracurricular activities, athletic programs, honors at graduation, or other district programs that use GPA as a criterion). Districts should be aware that, in determining college admissions eligibility, the California State University and the University of California consider students' GPA in the "a-g" subjects required for college entry and is based on grades recorded in their high school transcripts.
The Superintendent or designee shall calculate each student's GPA using the grade point assigned to each letter grade in accordance with the scale described in the section "Grades for Academic Performance" above. The grade points for all applicable coursework shall be totaled and divided by the number of courses completed. Pass/Fail grades shall not be included in the determination of a student's GPA.

OPTION 1: When plus and minus designations are added to letter grades, they shall not be considered in determining GPA.

OPTION 1 ENDS HERE

OPTION 2: When plus and minus designations are added to letter grades, a plus shall be computed by adding 0.3 to the value assigned the letter grade and a minus shall be computed by subtracting 0.3 from the value assigned to the letter grade.

OPTION 2 ENDS HERE

CSBA NOTE: Education Code 69432.9 provides that all students in grade 12 will be considered Cal Grant applicants unless they opt out of the program. The GPA of all students in grade 12 who have not opted out of the program shall be submitted to the Student Aid Commission. See AR 5125 - Student Records for related requirements.
Each academic year, the Superintendent or designee shall provide to the Student Aid Commission the GPA of all district students in grade 12, except for students who have opted out or are permitted by the rules of the Student Aid Commission to provide test scores in lieu of the GPA. (Education Code 69432.9)

Districts should be aware that, in determining college admissions eligibility, the California State University and the University of California consider students' GPA in the "a-g" subjects required for college entry and is based on grades recorded in their high school transcripts.</div><annotation contenteditable="false" data-annotation-id="MNDYNg16" data-ant="%7B%22id%22%3A%22MNDYNg16%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22comments%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22MMw366%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22fSf0ysaXD9tFEJN0131FOw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userName%22%3A%22CSBA%20NOTE%22%2C%22time%22%3A1573240867%2C%22text%22%3A%22The%20following%20optional%20section%20should%20be%20revised%20to%20reflect%20the%20district%27s%20methodology%20for%20calculating%20GPA.%20Districts%20may%20calculate%20multiple%20GPAs%20for%20a%20single%20student%20%28e.g.%2C%20academic%20GPA%2C%20total%20GPA%29%20for%20different%20purposes%20%28e.g.%2C%20eligibility%20for%20extracurricular%20activities%2C%20athletic%20programs%2C%20honors%20at%20graduation%2C%20or%20other%20district%20programs%20that%20use%20GPA%20as%20a%20criterion%29.%20Districts%20should%20be%20aware%20that%2C%20in%20determining%20college%20admissions%20eligibility%2C%20the%20California%20State%20University%20and%20the%20University%20of%20California%20consider%20students%27%20GPA%20in%20the%20%5C%22a-g%5C%22%20subjects%20required%20for%20college%20entry%20and%20is%20based%20on%20grades%20recorded%20in%20their%20high%20school%20transcripts.%22%7D%5D%7D" data-track-changes-ignore="true" id="dom-MNDYNg16" title="CSBA NOTE: The following optional section should b..."></annotation><br style="display:none">
