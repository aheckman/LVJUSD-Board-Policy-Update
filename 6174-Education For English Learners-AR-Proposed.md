Definitions

English learner means a student who is age 3-21 years, who is enrolled or is preparing to enroll in an elementary or secondary school, and whose difficulties in speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language may be sufficient to deny the student the ability to meet state academic standards, the ability to successfully achieve in classrooms where the language of instruction is English, or the opportunity to participate fully in society. An English learner may include a student who was not born in the United States or whose native language is a language other than English; a student who is Native American or Alaska Native, or a native resident of the outlying areas, who comes from an environment where a language other than English has had a significant impact on the individual's level of English language proficiency; or a student who is migratory, whose native language is a language other than English, and who comes from an environment where a language other than English is dominant.  (Education Code 306; 20 USC 7801)

Designated English language development means instruction provided during a time set aside in the regular school day for focused instruction on the state-adopted English language development standards to assist English learners to develop critical English language skills necessary for academic content learning in English.  (5 CCR 11300)

Integrated English language development means instruction in which the state-adopted English language development standards are used in tandem with the state-adopted academic content standards. Integrated English language development includes specially designed academic instruction in English.  (5 CCR 11300)

Long-term English learner means:


	For the purpose of setting the local control and accountability plan (LCAP) priorities, a student who has not attained English language proficiency within seven years of initial classification as an English learner  (Education Code 52052)
	 
	For the purpose of English language proficiency assessment, an English learner in grades 6- 12 who has been enrolled in school in the United States for six years or more and who either:  (Education Code 313.1)
	 
	
		Has remained at the same English language proficiency level for two or more consecutive years, or has regressed to a lower proficiency level; or
		 
		Is a student in grades 6-9 who has scored far below basic or below basic on the prior year's English language arts standards-based achievement test, or a score determined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction on any successor test
	
	

Native speaker of English means a student who has learned and used English at home from early childhood and English has been the primary means of concept formation and communication.  (Education Code 306)

Identification and Assessments

Upon enrollment in the District, each student's primary language shall be determined through the use of a home language survey.  (Education Code 52164.1; 5 CCR 11307, 11518.5)

Any student in kindergarten or grades 1-12, not including transitional kindergarten, who is identified as having a primary language other than English, as determined by the home language survey, and who has not previously been identified as an English learner by a California public school or for whom there is no record of results from an administration of an English language proficiency test, shall be initially assessed for English proficiency using the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC). Prior to administering the ELPAC, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the student's parent/guardian in writing that the student will be administered the initial ELPAC.  (Education Code 313, 52164.1; 5 CCR 11518.5)

Administration of the ELPAC, including the use of variations and accommodations in test administration when authorized, shall be conducted in accordance with test publisher instructions and 5 CCR 11518.5-11518.37.

Based on the initial assessment, the student shall be classified either as Initial Fluent English Proficient or as an English learner. The Superintendent or designee shall notify the student's parent/guardian, in writing, of the results of the ELPAC initial assessment within 30 calendar days after the student's date of initial enrollment, or, if administered prior to the student's initial date of enrollment, up to 60 calendar days prior to such enrollment, but not before July 1 of the school year of the student's initial enrollment. The notice shall indicate whether the student met the ELPAC initial assessment criterion for proficiency and include the District's contact information for use if the parent/guardian has questions or concerns regarding the student's classification.  (5 CCR 11518.5)

Each year after a student is identified as an English learner and until the student is redesignated as English proficient, the summative assessment of the ELPAC shall be administered to the student during a four-month period after January 1 as determined by the California Department of Education.  (Education Code 313)

The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians of their child's results on the summative assessment of the ELPAC within 30 calendar days following receipt of the results from the test contractor or, if the results are received from the test contractor after the last day of instruction for the school year, within 15 working days of the start of the next school year.  (Education Code 52164.1; 5 CCR 11518.15)

The parent/guardian of a student participating in, or identified for participation in, a language instruction program supported by federal Title I or Title III funds shall receive notification of the assessment of the student's English proficiency. Such notice shall be provided no later than 30 calendar days after the beginning of the school year or, if the student is identified for program participation during the school year, within two weeks of the student's placement in the program.

Language Acquisition Programs

Whenever parents/guardians of enrolled students, and those enrolled for attendance in the next school year, request that the District establish a specific language acquisition program in accordance with Education Code 310, such requests shall be addressed through the following process:  (5 CCR 11311)

	The school shall make a written record of each request, including any request submitted verbally, that includes the date of the request, the names of the parent/guardian and student making the request, a general description of the request, and the student's grade level on the date of the request

	The school shall monitor requests on a regular basis and notify the Superintendent or designee when the parents/guardians of at least 30 students enrolled in the school, or at least 20 students in the same grade level, request the same or a substantially similar type of language acquisition program
	
	If the requests are for a multilingual program model, the District shall consider requests from parents/guardians of students enrolled in the school who are native English speakers in determining whether this threshold is reached.
	 
	If the number of parents/guardians described in Item #2 is attained, the Superintendent or designee shall:
	 
	
		Within 10 days of reaching the threshold, notify the parents/guardians of students attending the school, the school's teachers, administrators, and the District's English Learner Parent Advisory Committee and parent advisory committee, in writing, of the requests for a language acquisition program
		 
		Identify costs and resources necessary to implement any new language acquisition program, including, but not limited to, certificated teachers with the appropriate authorizations, necessary instructional materials, pertinent professional development for the proposed program, and opportunities for parent/guardian and community engagement to support the proposed program goals
		 
		Within 60 calendar days of reaching the threshold number of parents/guardians described in Item #2 above, determine whether it is possible to implement the requested language acquisition program and provide written notice of the determination to parents/guardians of students attending the school, the school's teachers, and administrators
	
	

If a determination is made to implement the language acquisition program, create and publish a reasonable timeline of actions necessary to implement the program. If a determination is made that it is not possible to implement the program, provide a written explanation of the reason(s) the program cannot be provided. The District shall notify parents/guardians at the beginning of each school year or upon the student's enrollment regarding the process to request a language acquisition program, including a dual-language immersion program, for their child. The notice shall also include the following:  (5 CCR 11309, 11310)

	The manner in which the program will, within a reasonable period of time, lead to language proficiency and achievement of the state-adopted content standards in English and, when the program includes instruction in another language, in that other language
	 
	The process to request establishment of a language acquisition program not offered at the school
	 
	For any dual-language immersion program offered, the specific languages to be taught

The District shall provide additional and appropriate educational services to English learners for the purposes of overcoming language barriers and academic deficits in other areas of the core curriculum.  (5 CCR 11302)

Advisory Committees

A school-level English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) shall be established when there are more than 20 English learners at the school. Parents/guardians of English learners, elected by parents/guardians of English learners at the school, shall constitute committee membership in at least the same percentage as English learners represent of the total number of students in the school. The school may designate for this purpose an existing school-level advisory committee provided that it meets these criteria for committee membership.  (Education Code 52176; 5 CCR 11308)

The ELAC shall be responsible for assisting in the development of a schoolwide needs assessment, recommending ways to make parents/guardians aware of the importance of regular school attendance, and advising the principal and school staff in the development of a detailed master plan for English learners for the individual school and submitting the plan to the Board of Education for consideration for inclusion in the District master plan.  (Education Code 52176)

When the District has more than 50 English learners, the Superintendent or designee shall establish a District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC), the majority of whose membership shall be composed of parents/guardians of English learners who are not employed by the District. Alternatively, the District may use a subcommittee of an existing Districtwide advisory committee on which parents/guardians of English learners have membership in at least the same percentage as English learners represent of the total number of students in the District.  (Education Code 52176)

The DELAC shall advise the Board on at least the following tasks:  (5 CCR 11308)

	Developing a District master plan, including policy(ies), for education programs and services for English learners, taking into consideration the school site plans for English learners
	 
	Conducting a Districtwide needs assessment on a school-by-school basis
	 
	Establishing a District program, goals, and objectives for programs and services for English learners
	 
	Developing a plan to ensure compliance with applicable teacher or instructional aide requirements
	 
	Administering the annual language census
	 
	Reviewing and commenting on the District's reclassification procedures
	 
	Reviewing and commenting on the required written parental notifications

In order to assist the advisory committee in carrying out its responsibilities, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that DELAC and ELAC committee members receive appropriate training and materials. This training shall be planned in full consultation with the members.  (5 CCR 11308)

Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) Advisory Committee

When there are at least 15 percent English learners in the District, with at least 50 students who are English learners, a District-level English Learner Parent Advisory Committee shall be established to review and comment on the District's LCAP. Such advisory committee shall provide input regarding the District's existing language acquisition programs and language programs, and, where possible, the establishment of other such programs, in accordance with Board Policy 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan. The committee shall be composed of a majority of parents/guardians of English learners. If the DELAC acts as the ELAC pursuant to Education Code 52063 and 52062, the DELAC shall also review and comment on the development or annual update of the LCAP.  (Education Code 52062, 52063; 5 CCR 11301, 15495)

The DELAC may also serve as the LCAP ELAC, as specified in Board Policy 0460 - Local Control and Accountability Plan.
