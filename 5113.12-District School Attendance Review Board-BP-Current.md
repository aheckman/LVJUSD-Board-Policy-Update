## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The following Board policy is for use by districts that have established their own school attendance review board (SARB), in addition to or instead of a county office of education SARB, as authorized pursuant to Education Code 48321. If a district desires to establish a local SARB but a county SARB exists, the district must contact the county SARB chairperson to request permission to form a local SARB. If no county SARB exists, the Governing Board may establish a local SARB which operates in the same manner and under the same authority as a county SARB. For further information about procedures for addressing truancy, including, but not limited to, circumstances that require referral to a SARB, see BP/AR 5113.1 - Chronic Absence and Truancy.Pursuant to Education Code 48240-48244, the district may appoint a district employee to serve as an attendance supervisor, jointly employ an attendance supervisor with one or more other districts, or contract with the County Superintendent of Schools for the supervision of attendance of district students. The duties of the attendance supervisor, as specified in Education Code 48240, include duties related to compulsory full-time education and truancy. See AR 5113.11 - Attendance Supervision.
The Governing Board recognizes that poor school attendance and behavior problems negatively impact student achievement and put students at greater risk of dropping out of school. The Superintendent or designee shall establish a comprehensive and integrated system for the early identification of attendance problems and shall implement strategies to encourage students' attendance. After other interventions have been exhausted, students with a pattern of unexcused absences may be referred to a school attendance review board (SARB), in accordance with applicable law, in order to receive intensive guidance and assistance.

CSBA NOTE: The following optional paragraph is based on a goal stated in Education Code 48322.
The SARB shall maintain a continuing inventory of community resources, including alternative educational programs.

The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with the SARB and appropriate community agencies, including, but not limited to, law enforcement agencies, child welfare agencies, and health services, to provide school-based and/or community-based interventions tailored to the specific needs of the student.

The Board shall appoint members to the district's SARB, who may include a parent/guardian as well as representatives of various agencies including, but not limited to, school districts;  the county probation department; the county welfare department; the County Superintendent of Schools; law enforcement agencies; community-based youth service centers; school guidance personnel; child welfare and attendance personnel; school or county health care personnel; school, county, or community mental health personnel; the county district attorney's office; and the county public defender's office.  (Education Code 48321)

The district's SARB shall provide support to improve student attendance and behavior through proactive efforts focused on building positive school environments and improved school connectedness, early identification and immediate intervention to re-engage students with poor attendance or behavior, and intensive intervention with students and families to address severe or persistent attendance or behavior issues.

CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Education Code 48324, if a county SARB exists, the district's SARB must be governed by rules and regulations consistent with the rules and regulations established by the county SARB or by other legal requirements. In the absence of a county SARB, the local SARB has the authority to set rules and regulations consistent with law. The following paragraph may be revised to reflect district practice.SARBs are also subject to the open meeting requirements of the Brown Act (Government Code 54950-54963), including notice requirements, except that meetings may be held in closed session when considering matters related to individual students; see the accompanying administrative regulation.
The district's SARB shall operate in accordance with Education Code 48320-48325, the Brown Act (Government Code 54950-54963), and the bylaws of the SARB.

CSBA NOTE: The California Department of Education's School Attendance Review Board Handbook includes a sample report form for meeting the following requirements of Education Code 48273. The report includes the composition of the SARB; the numbers and types of referrals (i.e., attendance and/or behavior); total number of students referred to the SARB and number of students by grade level, gender, and race/ethnicity; and the disposition of the referrals, including the number of cases referred to courts or other agencies. According to the handbook, the annual report should also be provided to member organizations of the SARB.
The SARB shall collect data and annually report outcomes on SARB referrals to the Governing Board, Superintendent or designee, and County Superintendent of Schools.  (Education Code 48273)
