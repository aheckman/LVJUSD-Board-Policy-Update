## Policy Content

CSBA NOTE: The California Supreme Court held in Randi W. v. Muroc Joint Unified School District that, under specified circumstances, school authorities could be held liable for physical harm to a student molested by a former employee when they recommended the employee to another district.  In light of this decision, districts should carefully consider any clause in a termination agreement that limits the district's ability to provide such information to prospective employers.  In general, districts should not enter into termination agreements without legal advice.
If a termination settlement agreement has been made with an employee, the Superintendent or designee shall inform prospective employers, upon request for an employment reference, that an agreement exists and that he/she may only provide information as provided for in the agreement.

CSBA NOTE: Government Code 53260-53264 provides that employee contracts must include a provision limiting the maximum cash settlement the employee may receive upon termination of the contract and that copies of settlement agreements must be available to the public upon request.  It is clear that these provisions apply to administrative staff, either certificated or classified, who are employed under a typical contract; see BP 4312.1 - Contracts.  It is not clear, however, whether these provisions would apply to teachers or classified staff.
Cash settlements made upon the termination of a contract shall never exceed an amount equal to the employee's monthly salary multiplied by the number of months, up to 18, in the unexpired term of the contract.  This amount is a maximum ceiling, not to be construed as a target amount for settlement agreements.  (Government Code 53260)

Settlement agreements shall not include noncash items other than health benefits, which the district may offer to continue for the unexpired term up to 18 months or until the employee finds other employment, whichever comes first.  (Government Code 53261)

Copies of settlement agreements with a superintendent, deputy superintendent, assistant superintendent, associate superintendent or other similar chief administrative officer or chief executive officer shall be made available to the public upon request.  (Government Code 53262)
CSBA NOTE: Regardless of any provisions in a termination agreement, 5 CCR 80303 requires that, when a certificated employee leaves the district's employment as a result of allegations which constitute probable cause for the revocation of the employee's credential, the employer is required to notify the CTC.  See AR 4117.7/4317.7 - Employment Status Reports.
