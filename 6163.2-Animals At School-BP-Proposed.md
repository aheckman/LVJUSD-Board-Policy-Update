## Policy Content

The Board of Education recognizes that animals can contribute to the District's instructional program by being effective teaching aids to students and by assisting individuals with disabilities to access District programs and activities.  In addition, instruction related to the care and treatment of animals teaches students a sense of responsibility and promotes the humane treatment of living creatures.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop rules and procedures to ensure that when animals are brought to school, the health, safety, and welfare of students, staff, and the animals are protected.  However, the District assumes no liability for the safety of animals allowed on District property.
